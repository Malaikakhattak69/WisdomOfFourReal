The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless  him and grant him peace, stopped to look for it and the people stopped with him.  There was no water nearby and the people were not carrying any with them, so they  came to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, 'Don't you see what A'isha has done? She has  made the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the  people stop when there is no water nearby and they are not carrying any with them.'  \"  A'isha continued, \"Abu Bakr came and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless  him and grant him peace, had fallen asleep with his head on my thigh . Abu Bakr  said, 'You have made the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him  peace, and the people stop when there is no water nearby and they are not carrying  any with them ' \"  She continued, \"Abu Bakr remonstrated with me and said whatever Allah willed  him to say, and began to poke me in the waist. The only thing that stopped me from  moving was that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  had his head on my thigh. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant  him peace, slept until morning found him with no water. Allah, the Blessed and  Exalted, sent down the ayat of tayammum and so they did tayammum. Usayd ibn  Hudayr said, 'This is not the first baraka from you, O family of Abu Bakr.'\"  A'isha added, \"We roused the camel I had been on and found the necklace under it.\"  Malik was asked whether a man who did tayammum for one prayer should do  tayammum when the time of the next prayer came or whether the first tayammum  was enough. He said, \"No, he does tayammum for every prayer, because he has to  look for water for every prayer. If he looks for it and does not find it then he does  tayammum.\"  Malik was asked whether a man who did tayammum could lead others in prayer if  they were in wudu. He said, \"I prefer that someone else should lead them. However,  I see no harm in it if he does lead them in prayer.\"  Yahya said that Malik said that a man who did tayammum because he could not  find any water, and then stood and said the takbir and entered into the prayer, and  then someone came with some water, did not stop his prayer but completed it with  tayammum and did wudu for future prayers.  Yahya said that Malik said, \"Whoever rises for prayer and does not find water and  so does what Allah has ordered him to do of tayammum has obeyed Allah.  Someone who does find water is neither purer than him nor more perfect in prayer,  because both have been commanded and each does as Allah has commanded. What  Allah has commanded as far as wudu is concerned is for the one who finds water,  and tayammum is for the one who does not find water before he enters into the  prayer.\"  Malik said that a man who was in a state of major ritual impurity could do  tayammum and read his portion of Qur'an and do voluntary prayers as long as he  did not find any water. This applied only to circumstances in which it was allowable  to pray with tayammum.  18 Section: How to do Tayammum"

Malik said, \"The agreed sunna with us is that zakat has to be paid on twenty dinars  (of gold coin), in the same way as it has to be paid on two hundred dirhams (of  silver).\"  Malik said, \"There is no zakat to pay on (gold) that is clearly less than twenty dinars  (in weight) but if it increases so that by the increase the amount reaches a full  twenty dinars in weight then zakat has to be paid. Similarly, there is no zakat to pay  on (silver) that is clearly less than two hundred dirhams (in weight), but if it  increases so that by the increase the amount reaches a full two hundred dirhams in  weight then zakat has to be paid. If it passes the full weight then I think there is  zakat to pay, whether it be dinars or dirhams.\" (i.e. the zakat is assessed by the  weight and not the number of the coins.)  Malik said, about a man who had one hundred and sixty dirhams by weight, and the  exchange rate in his town was eight dirhams to a dinar, that he did not have to pay  any zakat. Zakat had only to be paid on twenty dinars of gold or two hundred  dirhams.  Malik said, in the case of a man who acquired five dinars from a transaction or in  some other way which he then invested in trade, that, as soon as it increased to a  zakatable amount and then a year elapsed, he had to pay zakat on it, even if the  zakatable amount was reached one day before or one day after the passing of a year.  There was then no zakat to pay on it from the day the zakat was taken until a year  had elapsed over it.  Malik said, in the similar case of a man who had in his possession ten dinars which  he invested in trade and which reached twenty dinars by the time one year had  elapsed over them, that he paid zakat on them right then and did not wait until a  year had elapsed over them, (counting) from the day when they actually reached the  zakatable amount. This was because a year had elapsed over the original dinars and  there were now twenty of them in his possession. After that there was no zakat to  pay on them from the day the zakat was paid until another year had elapsed over  them.  Malik said, \"What we are agreed upon (here in Madina) regarding income from  hiring out slaves, rent from property, and the sums received when a slave buys his  freedom, is that no zakat is due on any of it, whether great or small, from the day  the owner takes possession of it until a year has elapsed over it from the day when  the owner takes possession of it.\"  3 Malik said, in the case of gold and silver which was shared between two co-owners,  that zakat was due from any one whose share reached twenty dinars of gold, or two  hundred dirhams of silver, and that no zakat was due from anyone whose share fell  short of this zakatable amount. If all the shares reached the zakatable amount and  the shares were not equally divided, zakat was taken from each man according to  the measure of his share. This applied only when the share of each man among  them reached the zakatable amount, because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah  bless him and grant him peace, had said, \"There is no zakat to pay on less than five  awaq of silver.\"  Malik commented, \"This is what I prefer most out of what I have heard about the  matter.\"  Malik said, \"When a man has gold and silver dispersed among various people he  must add it all up together and then take out the zakat due on the total sum .\"  Malik said, \"No zakat is due from some one who acquires gold or silver until a year  has elapsed over his acquisition from the day it became his.\"  Section: The Zakat On Mines"

Malik said, \"In my opinion, and Allah knows best, nothing is taken from what  comes out of mines until what comes out of them reaches a value of twenty gold  dinars or two hundred silver dirhams.

Zakat is levied on anything over that, according to  how much of it there is as long as there continues to be a supply from the mine. If  the vein runs out, and then after a while more becomes obtainable, the new supply  is dealt with in the same way as the first, and payment of zakat on it is begun on it  as it was begun on the first.  Malik said, \"Mines are dealt with like crops, and the same procedure is applied to  both.

When I meet him, I will ask him.\" But the Messenger of  Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, died before Muadh ibn Jabal  returned.  Yahya said that Malik said, \"The best that I have heard about some one who has  sheep or goats with two or more shepherds in different places is that they are added  together and the owner then pays the zakat on them. This is the same situation as a  man who has gold and silver scattered in the hands of various people. He must add  it all u p and pay whatever zakat there is to pay on the sum total.\"  Yahya said that Malik said, about a man who had both sheep and goats, that they  were added up together for the zakat to be assessed, and if between them they came  to a number on which zakat was due, he paid zakat on them. Malik added, \"They  9 are all considered as sheep, and in Umar ibn al-Khattab's book it says, 'On grazing  sheep and goats, if they come to forty or more, one ewe.' \"  Malik said, \"If there are more sheep than goats and their owner only has to pay one  ewe, the zakat collector takes the ewe from the sheep. If there are more goats than  sheep, he takes it from the goats. If there is an equal number of sheep and goats, he  takes the ewe from whichever kind he wishes.\"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"Similarly, Arabian camels and Bactrian camels are  added up together in order to assess the zakat that the owner has to pay. They are all  considered as camels. If there are more Arabian camels than Bactrians and the  owner only has to pay one camel, the zakat collector takes it from the Arabian ones.  If, however, there are more Bactrian camels he takes it from those. If there is an  equal number of both, he takes the camel from whichever kind he wishes.\"  Malik said, \"Similarly, cows and water buffaloes are added up together and are all  considered as cattle. If there are more cows than water buffalo and the owner only  has to pay one cow, the zakat collector takes it from the cows. If there are more  water buffalo, he takes it from them. If there is an equal number of both, he takes  the cow from whichever kind he wishes. So if zakat is necessary, it is assessed  taking both kinds as one group.\"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"No zakat is due from anyone who comes into  possession of livestock, whether camels or cattle or sheep and goats, until a year has  elapsed over them from the day he acquired them, unless he already had in his  possession a nisab of livestock. (The nisab is the minimum amount on which zakat  has to be paid, either five head of camels, or thirty cattle, or forty sheep and goats).  If he already had five head of camels, or thirty cattle, or forty sheep and goats, and  he then acquired additional camels, or cattle, or sheep and goats, either by trade, or  gift, or inheritance, he must pay zakat on them when he pays the zakat on the  livestock he already has, even if a year has not elapsed over the acquisition. And  even if the additional livestock that he acquired has had zakat taken from it the day  before he bought it, or the day before he inherited it, he must still pay the zakat on it  when he pays the zakat on the livestock he already has \"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"This is the same situation as some one who has some  silver on which he pays the zakat and then uses to buy some goods with from  somebody else. He then has to pay zakat on those goods when he sells them. It  could be that one man will have to pay zakat on them one day, and by the following  day the other man will also have to pay.\"  Malik said, in the case of a man who had sheep and goats which did not reach the  zakatable amount, and who then bought or inherited an additional number of sheep  and goats well above the zakatable amount, that he did not have to pay zakat on all  his sheep and goats until a year had elapsed over them from the day he acquired the  new animals, whether he bought them or inherited them.This was because none of  the livestock that a man had, whether it be camels, or cattle, or sheep and goats, was  counted as a nisab until there was enough of any one kind for him to have to pay  zakat on it. This was the nisab which is used for assessing the zakat on what the  owner had additionally acquired, whether it were a large or small amount of  livestock.  Malik said, \"If a man has enough camels, or cattle, or sheep and goats, for him to  have to pay zakat on each kind, and then he acquires another camel, or cow, or  10 sheep, or goat, it must be included with the rest of his animals when he pays zakat  on them \"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"This is what I like most out of what I heard about the  matter.\"  Malik said, in the case of a man who does not have the animal required of him for  the zakat, \"If it is a two-year-old she-camel that he does not have, a three-year-old  male camel is taken instead. If it is a three- or four- or five-year-old she-camel that  he does not have, then he must buy the required animal so that he gives the  collector what is due.

If, for instance, one of the associates has  forty or more sheep and goats and the other has less than forty sheep and goats, then  the one who has forty has to pay zakat and the one who has less does not. If both of  them have a zakatable amount (of livestock) then both of them are assessed together  (i.e the flock is assessed as one) and both of them have to pay zakat. If one of them  has a thousand sheep, or less, that he has to pay zakat on, and the other has forty, or  more, then they are associates, and each one pays his contribution according to the  number of animals he has - so much from the one with a thousand, and so much  from the one with forty.  Malik said, \"Two associates in camels are the same as two associates in sheep and  goats, and, for the purposes of zakat, are assessed together if each one of them has a  zakatable amount (of camels). That is because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah  bless him and grant him peace, said, 'There is no zakat on less than five head of  camels,' and Umar ibn al-Khattab said, 'On grazing sheep and goats, if they come to  forty or more - one ewe.' \"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"This is what I like most out of what I have heard about  the matter.\"  Malik said that when Umar ibn al-Khattab said, \"Those separated should not be  gathered together nor should those gathered together be separated in order to avoid  paying zakat,\" what he meant was the owners of livestock.  Malik said, \"What he meant when he said, 'Those separated should not be gathered  together' is, for instance, that there is a group of three men, each of whom has forty  sheep and goats, and each of whom thus has to pay zakat. Then, when the zakat  11 collector is on his way ,they gather their flocks together so that they only owe one  ewe between them. This they are forbidden to do. What he meant when he said, 'nor  should those gathered together be separated,' is, for instance, that there are two  associates, each one of whom has a hundred and one sheep and goats, and each of  whom must therefore pay three ewes. Then, when the zakat collector is on his way,  they split up their flocks so that they only have to pay one ewe each. This they are  forbidden to do.

Neither do you take an akula, or a rubba, or a  makhid, or male sheep and goats in their second and third years, and this is a just  compromise between the young of sheep and goats and the best of them.\"  Malik said, \"A sakhla is a newborn lamb or kid. A rubba is a mother that is looking  after her offspring, a makhid is a pregnant ewe or goat, and an akula is a sheep or  goat that is being fattened for meat.\"  Malik said, about a man who had sheep and goats on which he did not have to pay  any zakat, but which increased by birth to a zakatable amount on the day before the  zakat collector came to them, \"If the number of sheep and goats along with their  (newborn) offspring reaches a zakatable amount then the man has to pay zakat on  them. That is because the offspring of the sheep are part of the flock itself. It is not  the same situation as when some one acquires sheep by buying them, or is given  them, or inherits them. Rather, it is like when merchandise whose value does not  come to a zakatable amount is sold, and with the profit that accrues it then comes to  a zakatable amount. The owner must then pay zakat on both his profit and his  original capital, taken together. If his profit had been a chance acquisition or an  inheritance he would not have had to pay zakat on it until one year had elapsed over  it from the day he had acquired it or inherited it.\"  Malik said, \"The young of sheep and goats are part of the flock, in the same way  that profit from wealth is part of that wealth. There is, however, one difference, in  that when a man has a zakatable amount of gold and silver, and then acquires an  additional amount of wealth, he leaves aside the wealth he has acquired and does  not pay zakat on it when he pays the zakat on his original wealth but waits until a  year has elapsed over what he has acquired from the day he acquired it. Whereas a  man who has a zakatable amount of sheep and goats, or cattle, or camels, and then  acquires another camel, cow, sheep or goat, pays zakat on it at the same time that he  pays the zakat on the others of its kind, if he already has a zakatable amount of  livestock of that particular kind.\"  Malik said, \"This is the best of what I have heard about this. \"  12 Section: What to do about the Zakat when Two Years are Assessed  together"

This is because the only zakat which an owner of  livestock has to pay is what is due from him on the day that the zakat is (actually)  assessed. His livestock may have died or it may have increased, and the zakat  collector only assesses the zakat on what he (actually) finds on the day he makes the  assessment.

    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik from Ziyad ibn Sad that Ibn Shihab said, \"Neither  jurur, nor musran al-fara, nor adhq ibn hubayq should be taken as zakat from dates.  They should be included in the assessment but not taken as zakat. \"  Malik said, \"This is the same as with sheep and goats, whose young are included in  the assessment but are not (actually) taken as zakat. There are also certain kinds of  fruit which are not taken as zakat, such as burdi dates (one of the finest kinds of  dates), and similar varieties.  Neither the lowest quality (of any property) nor the highest should be taken. Rather,  zakat should be taken from average quality property.\"  Malik said, \"The position that we are agreed upon concerning fruit is that only dates  and grapes are estimated while on the tree. They are estimated when their usability  is clear and they are halal to sell. This is because the fruit of date-palms and vines is  eaten straightaway in the form of fresh dates and grapes, and so the assessment is  done by estimation to make things easier for people and to avoid causing them  trouble. Their produce is estimated and then they are given a free hand in using  their produce as they wish, and later they pay the zakat on it according to the  estimation that was made.\"  Malik said, \"crops which are not eaten fresh, such as grains and seeds, which are  only eaten after they have been harvested, are not estimated. The owner, after he  has harvested, threshed and sifted the crop, so that it is then in the form of grain or  seed, has to fulfil his trust himself and deduct the zakat he owes if the amount is  large enough for him to have to pay zakat. This is the position that we are all agreed  upon here (in Madina).\"  Malik said, \"The position that we are all agreed upon here (in Madina) is that the  produce of date palms is estimated while it is still on the tree, after it has ripened  and become halal to sell, and the zakat on it is deducted in the form of dried dates at  the time of harvest. If the fruit is damaged after it has been estimated and the  damage affects all the fruit then no zakat has to be paid. If some of the fruit remains  unaffected, and this fruit amounts to five awsuq or more using the sa of the Prophet,  may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then zakat is deducted from it. Zakat  does not have to be paid, however, on the fruit that was damaged . Grapevines are  dealt with in the same way.  If a man owns various pieces of property in various places, or is a co-owner of  various pieces of property in various places, none of which individually comes to a  zakatable amount, but which, when added together, do come to a zakatable amount,  then he adds them together and pays the zakat that is due on them .\"  Section: The Zakat on Seeds and Olives"

If there are less than five awsuq of olives, no  zakat has to be paid.  Olive trees are like date palms insofar as there is a tenth on whatever is watered by  rain or springs or any natural means, and a twentieth on whatever is irrigated.  However, olives are not estimated while on the tree. The sunna with us as far as  grain and seeds which people store and eat is concerned is that a tenth is taken from  whatever has been watered by rain or springs or any natural means, and a twentieth  from whatever has been irrigated, that is, as long as the amount comes to five awsuq  or more using the aforementioned sa, that is, the sa of the Prophet, may Allah bless  him and grant him peace. Zakat must be paid on anything above five awsuq  according to the amount involved.\"  Malik said, \"The kinds of grain and seeds on which there is zakat are: wheat, barley,  sult (a kind of barley), sorghum, pearl millet, rice, lentils, peas, beans, sesame seeds  and other such grains and seeds which are used for food. Zakat is taken from them  after they have been harvested and are in the form of grai n or seed.\" He said,  \"People are entrusted with the assessment and whatever they hand over is accepted  .\"  Malik was asked whether the tenth or the twentieth was taken out of olives before  they were sold or after and he said, \"The sale is not taken into consideration. It is  the people who produce the olives that are asked about the olives, just as it is the  people who produce foodstuffs that are asked about it, and zakat is taken from them  by what they say. Someone who gets five awsuq or more of olives from his olive  trees has a tenth taken from the oil after pressing. Whereas someone who does not  get five awsuq from his trees does not have to pay any zakat on the oil.\"  Malik said, \"Someone who sells his crops when they are ripe and are ready in the  husk has to pay zakat on them but the one who buys them does not. The sale of  crops is not valid until they are ready in the husk and no longer need water.\"  Malik said, concerning the word of Allah the Exalted, \"And give its due on the day  of its harvesting,\" that it referred to zakat, and that he had heard people saying that.  Malik said, \"If someone sells his garden or his land, on which are crops or fruit  which have not yet ripened, then it is the buyer who has to pay the zakat. If,  however, they have ripened, it is the seller who has to pay the zakat, unless paying  the zakat is one of the conditions of the sale.\"  Section: Fruit on which Zakat does Not have to be Paid"

    "text": "Malik said, \"If a man has four awsuq of dates he has harvested, four awsuq of  grapes he has picked, or four awsuq of wheat he has reaped or four awsuq of pulses  he has harvested, the different categories are not added together, and he does not  have to pay zakat on any of the categ ries - the dates, the grapes, the wheat or the  pulses - until any one of them comes to five awsuq using the sa of the Prophet, may  16 Allah bless him and grant him peace, as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless  him and grant him peace, said, 'There is no zakat (to pay) on anything less than five  awsuq of dates. 'lf any of the categories comes to five awsuq, then zakat must be  paid. If none of the categories comes to five awsuq, then there is no zakat to pay.  The explanation of this is that when a man harvests five awsuq of dates (from his  palms), he adds them all together and deducts the zakat from them even if they are  all of different kinds and varieties. It is the same with different kinds of cereal, such  as brown wheat, white wheat, barley and sult, which are all considered as one  category. If a man reaps five awsuq of any of these, he adds it all together and pays  zakat on it. If it does not come to that amount he does not have to pay any zakat. It  is the same (also) with grapes, whether they be black or red. If a man picks five  awsuq of them he has to pay zakat on them, but if they do not come to that amount  he does not have to pay any zakat. Pulses also are considered as one category, like  cereals, dates and grapes, even if they are of different varieties and are called by  different names. Pulses include chick-peas, lentils, beans, peas, and anything which  is agreed by everybody to be a pulse. If a man harvests five awsuq of pulses,  measuring by the aforementioned sa, the sa of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and  grant him peace, he collects them all together and must pay zakat on them, even if  they are of every kind of pulse and not just one kind.\"  Malik said, ''Umar ibn al-Khattab drew a distinction between pulses and wheat  when he took zakat from the Nabatean christians. He considered all pulses to be one  category and took a tenth from them, and from cereals and raisins he took a  twentieth.\"  Malik said, \"If some one asks, 'How can pulses be added up all together when  assessing the zakat so that there is just one payment, when a man can barter two of  one kind for one of another, while cereals can not be bartered at a rate of two to  one?', then tell him, 'Gold and silver are collected together when assessing the  zakat, even though an amount of gold dinars can be exchanged for many times tha  tamount of silver dirhams.' \"  Malik said, regarding date palms which are shared equally between two men, and  from which eight awsuq of dates are harvested, \"They do not have to pay any zakat  on them. If one man owns five awsuq of what is harvested from one piece of land,  and the other owns four awsuq or less, the one who owns the five awsuq has to pay  zakat, and the other one, who harvested four awsuq or less, does not have to pay  zakat. This is how things are done whenever there are associates in any crop,  whether the crop is grain or seeds that are reaped, or dates that are harvested, or  grapes that are picked . Any one of them that harvests five awsuq of dates, or picks  five awsuq of grapes, or reaps five awsuq of wheat, has to pay zakat, and whoever's  portion is less than five awsuq does not have to pay zakat. Zakat only has to be paid  by someone whose harvesting or picking or reaping comes to five awsuq.\"  Malik said, \"The sunna with us regarding anything from any of these categories, i.e.  wheat, dates, grapes and any kind of grain o rseed, which has had the zakat  deducted from it and is then stored by its owner for a number of years after he has  paid the zakat on it until he sell sit, is that he does not have to pay any zakat on the  price he sells it for until a year has elapsed over it from the day he made the sale, as  long as he got it through (chance) acquisition or some other means and it was not  intended for trading. Cereals, seeds and trade-goods are the same, in that if a man  acquires some and keeps them for a number of years and then sells them for gold or  silver, he does not have to pay zakat on their price until a year has elapsed over it  17 from the day of sale. If, however, the goods were intended for trade then the owner  must pay zakat on them when he sells them, as long as he has had them for a year  from the day when he paid zakat on the property with which he bought them.\"  Section: Fruits, Animal Fodder and Vegetables for which No Zakat has to  be Paid  Book 17, Number 17.22.37a:  Malik said, \"The sunna that we are all agreed upon here (in Madina) and which I  have heard from the people of knowledge, is that there is no zakat on any kind of  fresh (soft) fruit, whether it be pomegranates, peaches, figs or anything that is like  them or not like them as long as it is fruit.\"  He continued, \"No zakat has to be paid on animal fodder or herbs and vegetables of  any kind, and there is no zakat to pay on the price realised on their sale until a year  has elapsed over it from the day of sale which counts as the time the owner receives  the sum.\"  Section: The Zakat on Slaves, Horses and Honey"

Malik said, \"The sunna is that there is no jizya due from women or children of  people of the Book, and that jizya is only taken from men who have reached  19 puberty. The people of dhimma and the magians do not have to pay any zakat on  their palms or their vines or their crops or their livestock. This is because zakat is  imposed on the muslims to purify them and to be given back to their poor, whereas  jizya is imposed on the people of the Book to humble them. As long as they are in  the country they have agreed to live in, they do not have to pay anything on their  property except the jizya. If, however, they trade in muslim countries, coming and  going in them, a tenth is taken from what they invest in such trade. This is because  jizya is only imposed on them on conditions, which they have agreed on, namely  that they will remain in their own countries, and that war will be waged for them on  any enemy of theirs, and that if they then leave that land to go anywhere else to do  business they will haveto pay a tenth. Whoever among them does business with the  people of Egypt, and then goes to Syria, and then does business with the people of  Syria and then goes to Iraq and does business with them and then goes on to  Madina, or Yemen, or other similar places, has to pay a tenth.  People of the Book and magians do not have to pay any zakat on any of their  property, livestock, produce or crops. The sunna still continues like that. They  remain in the deen they were in, and they continue to do what they used to do. If in  any one year they frequently come and go in muslim countries then they have to  pay a tenth every time they do so, since that is outside what they have agreed upon,  and not one of the conditions stipulated for them.

Someone to whom something unexpected happens  which causes him to break his fast while he is fasting voluntarily does not have to  repeat his fast if he has broken it for a reason, and not simply because he decided to  break his fast.

If he says the takbir he should not stop until he has prayed  two rakas. If he is fasting he should not break his fast until he has completed that  day's fast. If he goes into ihram he should not return until he has completed his hajj,  and if he begins doing tawaf he should not stop doing so until he has gone around  the Kaba seven times. He should not stop doing any of these actions once he has  started them until he has completed them, except if something happens such as  illness or some other matter by which a man is excused. This is because Allah, the  Blessed and Exalted, says in His Book, 'And eat and drink until the white thread  becomes clear to you from the black thread of dawn, (and) then complete the fast  until night-time,' (Sura 2 ayat 187), and so he must complete his fast as Allah has  said. Allah, the Exalted, (also) says, 'And complete the hajj and the umra forAllah,'  and so if a man were to go into ihram for a voluntary hajj having done his one  obligatory hajj (on a previous occasion), he could not then stop doing his hajj  having once begun it and leave ihram while in the middle of his hajj.

The only  reason I see for disapproving of doing itikaf in a mosque where jumua is not held is  that the man doing itikaf would have to leave the mosque where he was doing itikaf  in order to go to jumua, or else not go there at all. If, however, he is doing itikaf in a  mosque where jumua is not held, and he does not have to go to jumua in any other  mosque, then I see no harm in him doing itikaf there, because Allah, the Blessed  and Exalted, says, 'While you are doing itikaf in mosques,' and refers to all mosques  in general, without specifying any particular kind.\"  Malik continued, \"Accordingly, it is permissiblefor a man to do itikaf in a mosque  where jumua is not held if he does not have to leave it to go to a mosque where  jumua is held.\"  Malik said, \"A person doing itikaf should spend the night only in the mosque where  2 he is doing itikaf, except if his tent is in one of the courtyards of the mosque. I have  never heard that someone doing itikaf can put up a shelter anywhere except in the  mosque itself or in one of the courtyards of the mosque.  Part of what shows that he must spend the night in the mosque is the saying of  A'isha, 'When the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  was doing itikaf, he would only go into the house to relieve himself.' Nor should he  do itikaf on the roof of the mosque or in the minaret.\"  Malik said, \"The person who is going to do itikaf should enter the place where he  wishes to do itikaf before the sun sets on the night when he wishes to begin his  itikaf, so that he is ready to begin the itikaf at the beginning of the night when he is  going to start his itikaf. A person doing itikaf should be occupied with his itikaf,  and not turn his attention to other things which might occupy him, such as trading  or whatever. There is no harm, however, if some one doing itikaf tells some one to  do something for him regarding his estate, or the affairs of his family, or tells  someone to sell some property of his, or something else that does not occupy him  directly. There is no harm in him arranging for someone else to do that for him if it  is a simple matter.\"  Malik said, \"I have never heard any of the people of knowledge mentioning any  modification as far as how to do itikaf is concerned. Itikaf is an act of ibada like the  prayer, fasting, the hajj, and such like acts, whether they are obligatory or  voluntary. Anyone who begins doing any of these acts should do them according to  what has come down in the sunna. He should not start doing anything in them that  the muslims have not done, whether it is a modification that he imposes on others,  or one that he begins doing himself. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him  and grant him peace, practised itikaf, and the muslims know what the sunna of itikaf  is.\"  Malik said, \"Itikaf and jiwar are the same, and Itikaf is the same for a  village-dweller as it is for a nomad.\"  Section: Things Without Which Itikaf is Not Possible"

I heard Malik say about muslim property that had been seized by the enemy, \"If it is  noticed before the distribution, then it is returned to itsowner. Whatever has already  been distributed is not returned to anyone.\"  Malik, when asked about a man whose young male slave was taken by the idol  worshippers and then the Muslims re-captured him, said, \"The owner is more  entitled to him without having to pay his price or value or having to incur any loss  before the distribution takes place. If the distribution has already taken place then I  think that the slave belongs to his master for his price if the master wants him  back.\"  Regarding an umm walad of a Muslim man who has been taken by the idol  worshippers and then recaptured by the Muslims and allotted in the distribution of  spoils and then recognised by her master after the distribution, Malik said, \"She is  not to be enslaved. I think that the Imam should pay a ransom for her for her master.  If he does not do it, then her master must pay a ransom for her and not leave her. I  do not think that she should be made a slave by whoever takes her and intercourse  with her is not halal. She is in the position of a free woman because her master  would be required to pay compensation if she injured somebody and so she is in the  same position (as a wife). He must not leave the mother of his son to be enslaved  6 nor may intercourse with her be made halal.\"  Malik was asked about a man who went to enemy territory to pay ransom or to  trade, and he bought a free man or a slave, or they were given to him. He said, \"As  for the free man, the price he buys him for is a debt against the man and he is not  made a slave. If the captive is given to him freely, he is free and owes nothing  unless the man gave something in recompense for him. That is a debt against the  free man, the same as if a ransom had been paid for him. As for a slave, his former  master can choose to take him back and pay his price to the man who bought him or  he can choose to leave him, as he wishes. If he was given to the man, the former  master is more entitled to him, and he owes nothing for him unless the man gave  something for him in recompense.

He is given a  sixth as a fixed share with the son and the grandson through a son. Other than that,  when the deceased does not leave a mother or a paternal aunt, one begins with  whoever has a fixed share, and they are given their shares. If there is a sixth of the  property left over, the grandfather is given a sixth as a fixed share.\"  Malik said, \"When someone shares with the grandfather and the full siblings in a  specified share, one begins with whoever shares with them of the people of fixed  shares. They are given their shares. What is left over after that belongs to the  grandfather and the full siblings. Then one sees which is the more favourable of two  alternatives for the portion of the grandfather. Either a third is allotted to him and  the siblings to divide between them, and he gets a share as if he were one of the  siblings, or else he takes a sixth from all the capital. Whichever is the best portion  for the grandfather is given to him. What is left after that, goes to the full siblings.  The male gets the portion of two females except in one particular case. The division  in this case is different from the preceding one. This case is when a woman dies and  leaves a husband, mother, full sister and grandfather. The husband gets a half, the  mother gets a third, the grandfather gets a sixth, and the full sister gets a half. The  5 sixth of the grandfather and the half of the sister are joined and divided into thirds.  The male gets the share of two females. Therefore, the grandfather has two thirds,  and the sister has one third.\"  Malik said, \"The inheritance of the half-siblings by the father with the grandfather  when there are no full siblings with them, is like the inheritance of the full siblings  (in the same situation). The males are the same as their males and the females are  the same as their females. When there are both full siblings and half-siblings by the  father, the full siblings include in their number the number of half-siblings by the  father, to limit the inheritance of the grandfather, i.e., if there was only one full  sibling with the grandfather. They would share, after the allotting of the fixed  shares, the remainder of the inheritance between them equally. If there were also  two half-siblings by the father, their number is added to the division of the sum,  which would then be divided four ways. A quarter going to the grandfather and  three-quarters going to the full siblings who annex the shares technically allotted to  the half-siblings by the father. They do not include the number of half-siblings by  the mother, because if there were only half-siblings by the father they would not  inherit anything with the grandfather and all the capital would belong to the  grandfather, and so the siblings would not get anything after the portion of the  grandfather.  \"It belongs to the full siblings more than the half-siblings by the father, and the  half-siblings by the father do not get anything with them unless the full siblings  consist of one sister. If there is one full sister, she includes the grandfather with the  half-siblings by her father in the division, however many. Whatever remains for her  and these half-siblings by the father goes to her rather than them until she has had  her complete share, which is half of the total capital. If there is surplus beyond half  of all the capital in what she and the half-siblings by the father acquire it goes to  them. The male has the portion of two females.

If there are  more than that, they share equally in a third.' (Sura 4 ayat 12) This heirless one does  not have heirs among his mother's siblings since there are no children or parents.

None of them inherited anything from his  companion unless it was known that he had been killed before his companion.  Malik said, \"That is the way of doing things about which there is no dispute, and  which none of the people of knowledge in our city doubt. The procedure with two  mutual heirs who are drowned, or killed in another way, when it is not known  which of them died first is the same - neither of them inherits anything from his  companion. Their inheritance goes to whoever remains of their heirs. They are  inherited from by the living.\"  Malik said, \"No one should inherit from anyone else when there is doubt, and one  should only inherit from the other when there is certainty of knowledge and  witnesses. That is because a man and his mawla whom his father has freed might  die at the same time. The sons of the free man could say, 'Our father inherited from  the mawla.' They should not inherit from the mawla without knowledge or  testimony that he died first. The living people most entitled to his wala' inherit from  him.\"  Malik said, \"Another example is two full brothers who die. One of them has  children and the other does not. They have a half-brother by their father. It is not  known which of them died first, so the inheritance of the childless one goes to his  half-brother by the father. The children of the full-brother get nothing.\"  Malik said, \"Another example is when a paternal aunt and the son of her brother  die, or else the daughter of the brother and her paternal uncle. It is not known which  of them died first. The paternal uncle does not inherit anything from the daughter of  his brother, and the son of the brother does not inherit anything from his paternal  aunt.\"  Section: The Inheritance of the Child of Lian and the Child of Fornication"

Ibn Masud returnedto Kufa,and he had just reached his dwelling  when the man who had asked him for the opinion came to visit and he ordered him  to separate from his wife.  Malik said that if a man married the mother of a woman who was his wife and he  had sexual relations with the mother then his wife was haram for him, and he had to  separate from both of them.

Among them was  the daughter of al-Walid ibn al-Mughira and she was the wife of Safwan ibn  Umayya. She became muslim on the day of the conquest (of Makka), and her  husband, Safwan ibn Umayya fled from Islam. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah  bless him and grant him peace, sent Safwan's paternal cousin, Wahb ibn Umayr  with the cloak of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  as a safe-conduct for Safwan ibn Umayya, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah  bless him and grant him peace, called him to Islam and asked for him to come to  him and if he was pleased with the matter to accept it.

When Safwan came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him  peace, with his cloak, he called out to him over the heads of the people,  \"Muhammad! Wahb ibn Umayr brought me your cloak and claimed that you had  summoned me to come to you and if I was pleased with the matter, I should accept  it and if not, you would give me a respite for two months. \"The Messenger of Allah,  may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"Come down, Abu Wahb.\" He said,  \"No, by Allah!

He sent to Safwan ibn Umayya to borrow  some equipment and arms that he had. Safwan said, \"Willingly or unwillingly?\" He  said, \"Willingly.\" Therefore he lent him the equipment and arms which he had.  Then Safwan went out with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant  him peace, while he was still a kafir. He was present at the battles of Hunayn and  at-Ta'if while he was still a kafir and his wife was a muslim.

Malik added, \"That was also the opinion of Ibn Shihab.\"  Malik said that if a man made a vow to abstain from intercourse with his wife and at  the end of four months he declared his intent to continue to abstain, he was  divorced. He could go back to his wife, but if he did not have intercourse with her  before the end of her idda, he had no access to her and he could not go back to her  unless he had an excuse - illness, imprisonment, or a similar excuse. His return to  her maintained her as his wife. If her idda passed and then he married her after that  and did not have intercourse with her until four months had passed and he declared  his intent to continue to abstain, divorce was applied to him by the first vow. If four  months passed, and he had not returned to her, he had no idda against her nor  access because he had married her and then divorced her before touching her.  Malik said that a man who made a vow to abstain from intercourse with his wife  and continued to abstain after four months and so divorced her, but then returned  and did not touch her and four months were completed before her idda was  completed, did not have to declare his intent and divorce did not befall him. If he  had intercourse with her before the end of her idda, he was entitled to her. If her  idda passed before he had intercourse with her, he had no access to her.

The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless  him and grant him peace, separated them and gave the child to the woman.  Malik said, \"Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, said, 'The testimony of men who accuse  their wives but do not have any witnesses except themselves is to testify by Allah  four times that he is being truthful, and a fifth time, that the curse of Allah will be  upon him, if he should be a liar. She will avoid punishment if she testifies by Allah  four times that he is a liar, and a fifth time, that the wrath of Allah shall be upon her,  if he should be telling the truth. ' \"(Sura 24 ayat 6).  Malik said, \"The sunna with us is that those who curse each other are never to be  remarried. If the man calls himself a liar, (i.e. takes back his accusation), he is  flogged with the hadd-punishment, and the child is given to him, and his wife can  never return to him. There is no doubt or dispute about this sunna among us. \"  Malik said, \"If a man separates from his wife by an irrevocable divorce by which he  cannot return to her, and then he denies the paternity of the child she is carrying,  whilst she claims that he is the father, and it is possible by the timing, that he be so,  he must curse her, and the child is not recognised as his.\"  Malik said, \"That is what is done among us, and it is what I have heard from the  11 people of knowledge.\"  Malik said that a man who accused his wife after he had divorced her trebly while  she was pregnant, and he had at first accepted being the father but then claimed that  he had seen her committing adultery before he separated from her, was flogged with  the hadd-punishment, and did not curse her.  If he denied the paternity of her child after he had divorced her trebly, and he had  not previously accepted it, then he cursed her.  Malik said, \"This is what I have heard.\"  Malik said, \"The slave is in the same position as the free man as regards making  accusations and invoking mutual curses (lian). He acts in the lian as the free man  acts although there is no hadd applied for slandering a female-slave.\"  Malik said, \"The muslim slave-girl and the christian and jewish free woman also do  lian when a free muslim marries one of them and has intercourse with her. That is  because Allah - may He be blessed and Exalted, said in His Book, 'As for those who  accuse their wives,' and they are their wives. This is what is done among us.  Malik said that a man who did the lian with his wife, and then stopped and called  himself a liar after one or two oaths and he had not cursed himself in the fifth one,  had to be flogged with the hadd-punishment, but they did not have to be separated.  Malik said that if a man divorced his wife and then after three months the woman  said, \"I am pregnant,\" and he denied paternity, then he had to do lian.  Malik said that the husband of a female slave who pronounced the lian on her and  then bought her, was not to have intercourse with her, even if he owned her. The  sunna which had been handed down about a couple who mutually cursed each other  in the lian was that they were never to return to each other.

If another nine months pass without her  having a period, she does an idda of three months. If she has a second period before  the end of those three months, she accepts the period. If nine months then pass  without a period, she does an idda of three months. If she has a third period, the  idda of the period is complete. If she does not have a period, she waits three  months, and then she is free to marry. Her husband can return to her before she  becomes free to marry unless he made her divorce irrevocable.\"  Malik said, \"The sunna with us is that when a man divorces his wife and has the  option to return to her, and she does part of her idda and then he returns to her and  then parts from her before he has had intercourse with her, she does not add to what  has passed of her idda. Her husband has wronged himself and erred if he returned to  her and had no need of her.\"  Malik said, \"What is done among us is that if a woman becomes a muslim while her  husband is a kafir and then he becomes muslim, he is entitled to her as long as she  is in her idda. If her idda is finished, he has no access to her. If he remarries her  after the end of her idda, however, that is not counted as divorce. Islam removed her  from him without divorce.\"  Section: The Two Arbiters"

He said, ''Urwa ibn az-Zubayr informed me that Abu  Hudhayfa ibn Utba ibn Rabia, one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah,  may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who was present at Badr, adopted Salim  (who is called Salim, the mawla of Abu Hudhayfa) as the Messenger of Allah, may  Allah bless him and grant him peace, adopted Zayd ibn Haritha. He thought of him  as his son, and Abu Hudhayfa married him to his brother's sister, Fatima bint  al-Walid ibn Utba ibn Rabia, who was at that time among the first emigrants. She  was one of the best unmarried women of the Quraysh. When Allah the Exalted sent  down in His Book what He sent down about Zayd ibn Haritha, 'Call them after their  true fathers. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah. If you do not know who  their fathers were then they are your brothers in the deen and your mawali,' (Sura 33  ayat 5) people in this position were traced back to their fathers. When the father was  not known, they were traced to their mawla.  \"Sahla bint Suhayl who was the wife of Abu Hudhayfa, and one of the tribe of Amr  ibn Luayy, came to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him  peace, and said, 'Messenger of Allah! We think of Salim as a son and he comes in  to see me while I am uncovered. We only have one room, so what do you think  about the situation?' The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him  peace, said, 'Give him five drinks of your milk and he will be mahram by it.' She  then saw him as a foster son. A'isha umm al-muminin took that as a precedent for  whatever men she wanted to be able to come to see her. She ordered her sister,  Umm Kulthum bint Abi Bakr as-Siddiq and the daughters of her brother to give  milk to whichever men she wanted to be able to come in to see her. The rest of the  wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, refused to let  anyone come in to them by such nursing. They said, 'No! By Allah! We think that  what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered  Sahla bint Suhayl to do was only an indulgence concerning the nursing of Salim  alone. No! By Allah! No one will come in upon us by such nursing!'  \"This is what the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  thought about the suckling of an older person.\""

Malik said, \"That is, in our opinion, but Allah knows best, that for instance, a man  buys a slave or slave-girl or rents an animal and then says to the person from whom  he bought the slave or leased the animal, 'I will give you a dinar or a dirham or  whatever on the condition that if I actually take the goods or ride what I have rented  from you, then what I have given you already goes towards payment of the goods or  hire of the animal. If I do not purchase the goods or hire the animal, then what I have  given you is yours without liability on your part.' \"  Malik said, \"According to the way of doing things with us there is nothing wrong in  bartering an arabic speaking merchant slave for abyssinian slaves or any other type  that are not his equal in eloquence, trading, shrewdness, and know-how. There is  nothing wrong in bartering one slave like this for two or more other slaves with a  stated delay in the terms if he is clearly different. If there is no appreciable difference  between the slaves, two should not be bartered for one with a stated delay in the  terms even if their racial type is different.\"  Malik said, \"There is nothing wrong in selling what has been bought in such a  transaction before taking possession of all of it as long as you receive the price for it  from some one other than the original owner.\"  Malik said, \"An addition to the price must not be made for a foetus in the womb of  its mother when she is sold because that is gharar (an uncertain transaction). It is not  known whether the child will be male or female, good-looking or ugly, normal or  handicapped, alive or dead. All these things will affect the price.\"  Malik said that in a transaction where a slave or slave-girl was bought for one  hundred dinars with a stated credit period that if the seller regretted the sale there was  nothing wrong in him asking the buyer to revoke it for ten dinars which he would  pay him immediately or after a period and he would forgo his right to the hundred  dinars which he was owed.  Malik said, \"However, if the buyer regrets and asks the seller to revoke the sale of a  slave or slave-girl in consideration of which he will pay an extra ten dinars  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 2 of 41 immediately or on credit terms, extended beyond the original term, that should not be  done. It is disapproved of because it is as if, for instance, the seller is buying the one  hundred dinars which is not yet due on a year's credit term before the year expires for  a slave-girl and ten dinars to be paid immediately or on credit term longer than the  year. This falls into the category of selling gold for gold when delayed terms enter  into it.\"  Malik said that it was not proper for a man to sell a slave-girl to another man for one  hundred dinars on credit and then to buy her back for more than the original price or  on a credit term longer than the original term for which he sold her. To understand  why that was disapproved of in that case, the example of a man who sold a slave-girl  on credit and then bought her back on a credit term longer than the original term was  looked at. He might have sold her for thirty dinars with a month to pay and then buy  her back for sixty dinars with a year or half a year to pay. The outcome would only  be that his goods would have returned to him just like they were and the other party  would have given him thirty dinars on a month's credit against sixty dinars on a year  or half a year's credit.

This is possible because a  master is not asked to pay zakat on his slave's property. If a slave has a slave-girl, it  is halal for him to have intercourse with her by his right of possession. If a slave is  freed or put under contract (kitaba) to purchase his freedom, then his property goes  with him.

    "text": "Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said from Salim ibn Abdullah that  Abdullah ibn Umar sold one of his slaves for eight hundred dirhams with the  stipulation that he was not responsible for defects. The person who bought the slave  complained to Abdullah ibn Umar that the slave had a disease which he had not told  him about. They argued and went to Uthman ibn Affan for a decision . The man said,  \"He sold me a slave with a disease which he did not tell me about.\" Abdullah said, \"I  sold to him with the stipulation that I was not responsible.\" Uthman ibn Affan  decided that Abdullah ibn Umar should take an oath that he had sold the slave  without knowing that he had any disease. Abdullah ibn Umar refused to take the  oath, so the slave was returned to him and recovered his health in his possession.  Abdullah sold him afterwards for 1500 dirhams.  Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing things among us about a man  who buys a female slave and she becomes pregnant, or who buys a slave and then  frees him, or if there is any other such matter which has already happened so that he  cannot return his purchase, and a clear proof is established that there was a fault in  that purchase when it was in the hands of the seller or the fault is admitted by the  seller or someone else, is that the slave or slave-girl is assessed for its value with the  fault it is found to have had on the day of purchase and the buyer is refunded,from  what he paid,the difference between the price of a slave who is sound and a slave  with such a defect.  Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing things among us regarding a  man who buys a slave and then finds out that the slave has a defect for which he can  be returned and meanwhile another defect has happened to the slave whilst in his  possession, is that if the defect which occurred to the slave in his possession has  harmed him, like loss of a limb, loss of an eye, or something similar, then he has a  choice. If he wants, he can have the price of the slave reduced commensurate with  the defect (he bought him with ) according to the prices on the day he bought him, or  if he likes, he can pay compensation for the defect which the slave has suffered in his  possession and return him. The choice is up to him. If the slave dies in his  possession, the slave is valued with the defect which he had on the day of his  purchase. It is seen what his price would really have been. If the price of the slave on  the day of purchase without fault was 100 dinars, and his price on the day of  purchase with fault would have been 80 dinars, the price is reduced by the  difference. These prices are assessed according to the market value on the day the  slave was purchased . \"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 4 of 41 Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing things among us is that if a  man returns a slave girl in whom he has found a defect and he has already had  intercourse with her, he must pay what he has reduced of her price if she was a  virgin. If she was not a virgin, there is nothing against his having had intercourse  with her because he had charge of her.\"  Malik said, \"The generally agreed upon way of doing things among us regarding a  person, whether he is an inheritor or not, who sells a slave, slave-girl, or animal  without a liability agreement is that he is not responsible for any defect in what he  sold unless he knew about the fault and concealed it. If he knew that there was a fault  and concealed it, his declaration that he was free of responsibility does not absolve  him, and what he sold is returned to him.\"  Malik spoke about a situation where a slave-girl was bartered for two other  slave-girls and then one of the slave-girls was found to have a defect for which she  could be returned. He said, \"The slave-girl worth two other slave-girls is valued for  her price. Then the other two slave-girls are valued, ignoring the defect which the  one of them has. Then the price of the slave-girl sold for two slave-girls is divided  between them according to their prices so that the proportion of each of them in her  price is arrived at - to the higher priced one according to her higher price, and to the  other according to her value. Then one looks at the one with the defect, and the buyer  is refunded according to the amount her share is affected by the defect, be it little or  great. The price of the two slave-girls is based on their market value on the day that  they were bought.\"  Malik spoke about a man who bought a slave and hired him out on a long-term or  short-term basis and then found out that the slave had a defect which necessitated his  return. He said that if the man returned the slave because of the defect, he kept the  hire and revenue. \"This is the way in which things are done in our city. That is  because, had the man bought a slave who then built a house for him, and the value of  the house was many times the price of the slave, and he then found that the slave had  a defect for which he could be returned, and he was returned, he would not have to  make payment for the work the slave had done for him. Similarly, he would keep any  revenue from hiring him out, because he had charge of him. This is the way of doing  things among us.\"  Malik said, \"The way of doing things among us when someone buys several slaves  in one lot and then finds that one of them has been stolen, or has a defect, is that he  looks at the one he finds has been stolen or the one in which he finds a defect. If he is  the pick of those slaves, or the most expensive, or it was for his sake that he bought  them, or he is the one in whom people see the most excellence, then the whole sale is  returned. If the one who is found to be stolen or to have a defect is not the pick of the  slaves, and he did not buy them for his sake, and there is no special virtue which  people see in him, the one who is found to have a defect or to have been stolen is  returned as he is, and the buyer is refunded his portion of the total price.\"  Section: What is Done about Slave-Girls when Purchased and Conditions  Made about Them  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 5 of 41"

It falls into the category of gambling because he is not  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 10 of 41 buying something from him for something definite which he pays. Everything which  resembles this is also forbidden.\"  Malik said that another example of that was, for instance, a man proposing to another  man, \"You have cloth. I will guarantee you from this cloth of yours so many hooded  cloaks, the measureof each cloak to be such-and-such, (naming a measurement).  Whatever loss there is, is against me and I will fulfill you the specified amount and  whatever excess there is, is mine.\" Or perhaps the man proposed, \"I will guarantee  you from this cloth of yours so many shirts, the measurement of each shirt to be  such-and-such, and whatever loss there is, is against me and I will fulfill the specified  amount and whatever excess there is, is mine.\" Or perhaps a man proposed to a man  who had cattle or camel hides, \"I will cut up these hides of yours into sandals on a  pattern I will show you. Whatever falls short of a hundred pairs, I will make up its  loss and whatever is over is mine because I guaranteed you.\" Another example was  that a man say to a man who had ben-nuts, \"I will press these nuts of yours.  Whatever falls short of such-and-such a weight by the pound, I will make it up, and  whatever is more than that is mine.\"  Malik said that all this and whatever else was like it or resembled it was in the  category of muzabana, which was neither good nor permitted. It was also the same  case for a man to say to a man, who had fodder leaves, date kernels, cotton, flax,  herbs or safflower, \"I will buy these leaves from you in exchange for such-and-such  a sa, (indicating leaves which are pounded like his leaves) . . or these date kernels for  such-and-such a sa of kernels like them, and the like of that in the case of safflower,  cotton, flax and herbs.\"  Malik said, \"All this is what we have described of muzabana.\"  Section: General Remarks about Selling Produce at its Source"

    "text": "Malik said, \"There is no harm in buying dates from specified trees or a specified  orchard or buying milk from specified sheep when the buyer starts to take them as  soon as he has payed the price. That is like buying oil from a container. A man buys  some of it for a dinar or two and gives his gold and stipulates that it be measured out  for him. There is no harm in that. If the container breaks and the oil is wasted, the  buyer has his gold back and there is no transaction between them.\"  Malik said, \"There is no harm in everything which is taken right away as it is, like  fresh milk and fresh picked dates which the buyer can take on a day-to-day basis. If  the supply runs out before the buyer has what he has paid for in full, the seller gives  him back the portion of the gold that is owed to him, or else the buyer takes other  goods from him to the value of what he is owed and which they mutually agree  about. The buyer should stay with the seller until he has taken it. It is disapproved of  for the seller to leave because the transaction would then come into the forbidden  category of a debt for a debt. If a stated time period for payment or delivery enters  into the transaction, it is also disapproved. Delay and deferment are not permitted in  it, and are only acceptable when it is standard practice on definite terms by which the  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 11 of 41 seller guarantees it to the buyer, but this is not to be from one specific orchard or  from any specific ewes.\"  Malik was asked about a man who bought an orchard from another man in which  there were various types of palm-trees - excellent ajwa palms, good kabis palms,  adhq palms and othertypes. The seller kept aside from the sale the produce of a  certain palm of his choice. Malik said, \"That is not good because if he does that, and  keeps aside, for instance, dates of the ajwa variety whose yield would be 15 sa, and  he picks the dates of the kabis in their place, and the yield of their dates is 10 sa or he  picks the ajwa which yield 15 sa and leaves the kabis which yield 10 sa, it is as if he  bought the ajwa for the kabis making allowances for their difference of quality. This  is the same as if a man dealing with a man who has heaps of dates before him - a  heap of 15 sa of ajwa, a heap of 10 sa of kabis, and a heap of 12 sa of cadhq, gives  the owner of the dates a dinar to let him choose and take whichever of the heaps he  likes.\" Malik said, \"That is not good.\"  Malik was asked what a man who bought fresh dates from the owner of an orchard  and advanced him a dinar was entitled to if the crop was spoilt. Malik said, \"The  buyer makes a reckoning with the owner of the orchard and takes what is due to him  of the dinar. If the buyer has taken two-thirds of a dinar's worth of dates, he gets back  the third of a dinar which is owed him. If the buyer has taken three-quarters of a  dinar's worth of dates, then he gets back the quarter which is owed to him, or they  come to a mutual agreement, and the buyer takes what is owed him from his dinar  from the owner of the orchard in something else of his choosing. If, for instance, he  prefers to take dry dates or some other goods, he takes them according to what is  due. If he takes dry dates or some other goods, he should stay with him until he has  been paid in full.\"  Malik said, \"This is the same situation as hiring out a specified riding-camel or hiring  out a slave tailor, carpenter or some other kind of worker or letting a house and  taking payment in advance for the hire of the slave or the rent of the house or camel.  Then an accident happens to what has been hired resulting in death or something  else. The owner of the camel, slave or house returns what remains of the rent of the  camel, the hire of the slave or the rent of the house to the one who advanced him the  money, and the owner reckons what will settle that up in full. If, for instance, he has  provided half of what the man paid for, he returns the remaining half of what he  advanced, or according to whatever amount is due.\" Malik said, \"Paying in advance  for something which is on hand is only good when the buyer takes possession of  what he has paid for as soon as he hands over the gold, whether it be slave, camel, or  house, or in the case of dates, he starts to pick them as soon as he has paid the  money.\"  It is not good that there be any deferment or credit in such a transaction.  Malik said, \"An example illustrating what is disapproved of in this situation is that,  for instance, a man may say that he will pay someone in advance for the use of his  camel to ride in the hajj, and the hajj is still some time off, or he may say something  similar to that about a slave or a house. When he does that, he only pays the money  in advance on the understanding that if he finds the camel to be sound at the time the  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 12 of 41 hire is due to begin, he will take it by virtue of what he has already paid. If an  accident, or death, or something happens to the camel, then he will get his money  back and the money he paid in advance will be considered as a loan.\"  Malik said, \"This is distinct from someone who takes immediate possession of what  he rents or hires, so that it does not fall into the category of 'uncertainty,' or  disapproved payment in advance. That is following a common practice. An example  of that is that a man buys a slave, or slave-girl, and takes possession of them and  pays their price. If something happens to them within the period of the year  indemnification contract, he takes his gold back from the one from whom he bought  it. There is no harm in that. This is the precedent of the sunna in the matter of selling  slaves.\"  Malik said, \"Someone who rents a specified slave, or hires a specified camel, for a  future date, at which time he will take possession of the camel or slave, has not acted  properly because he did not take possession of what he rented or hired, nor is he  advancing a loan which the person is responsible to pay back.\"  Section: Selling Fruit"

As for produce  which is not dried and stored but is eaten fresh like water melon, cucumber, melon,  carrots, citron, medlars, pomegranates, and soon, which when dried no longer counts  as fruit, and is not a thing which is stored up as is fruit, I think that it is quite proper  to barter such things two for one of the same variety hand to hand.

He poured his gold into one pan of  the scales, and the man with whom he was counterpoising put his gold in the other  pan of the scale and when the tongue of the scales was balanced, they took and gave.  Malik said, \"According to the way things are done among us there is no harm in  selling gold for gold, and silver for silver by counterpoising weight, even if 11 dinars  are taken for 10 dinars hand to hand, when the weight of gold is equal, coin for coin,  even if the number is different. Dirhams in such a situation are treated the same way  as dinars.\"  Malik said, \"If, when counterpoising gold for gold or silver for silver, there is a  difference of weight, one party should not give the other the value of the difference  in silver or something else. Such a transaction is ugly and a means to usury because if  one of the parties were permitted to take the difference for a separate price, it could  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 16 of 41 be as if he had bought it separately, so he would be permitted. Then it would be  possible for him to ask for many times the value of the difference in order to permit  the completion of the transaction between the two parties.

This leads to allowing what is forbidden . The matter  is forbidden.\"  Malik said that it was not good when counterpoising to give good old gold coins and  put along with them unminted gold in exchange for worn kufic gold, which was  unpopular and to then treat the exchange as like for like.  Malik said, \"The commentary on why that is disapproved is that the owner of the  good gold uses the excellence of his old gold coins as an excuse to throw in the  unminted gold with it. Had it not been for the superiority of his (good) gold over the  gold of the other party, the other party would not have counterpoised the unminted  gold for his kufic gold, and the deal would have been refused.  \"It is like a man wanting to buy three sa of ajwa dried dates for two sa and a mudd of  kabis dates, and on being told that it was not good, then offering two sa of kabis and  a sa of poor dates desiring to make the sale possible. That is not good because the  owner of the ajwa should not give him a sa of ajwa for a sa of poor dates. He would  only give him that because of the excellence of kabis dates.  \"Or it is like a man asking some one to sell him three sa of white wheat for two and a  half sa of Syrian wheat, and being told that it was not good except like for like, and  so offering two sa of wheat and one sa of barley intending to make the sale possible  between them. That is not good because no one would have given a sa of barley for a  sa of white wheat had that sa been by itself. It was only given because of the  excellence of Syrian wheat over the white wheat. This is not good. It is the same as  the case of the unminted gold.\"  Malik said, \"Where gold, silver and food, things which should only be sold like for  like, are concerned, something disliked and of poor quality should not be put with  something good and desirable in order to make the sale possible and to make a bad  situation halal. When something of desirable quality is put with something of poor  quality and it is only included so that its excellence in quality is noticed, something is  being sold which if it had been sold on its own, would not have been accepted and to  which the buyer would not have paid any attention. It is only accepted by the buyer  because of the superiority of what comes with it over his own goods. Transactions  involving gold, silver, or food, must not have anything of this description enter into  them. If the owner of the poor quality goods wants to sell them, he sells them on their  own, and does not put anything with them.

Malik said, \"The way of doing things among us concerning someone who makes an  advance for foodstuffs at a known rate until a stated date, and the date arrives and he  finds that there is not enough of what he was sold with the seller to fulfill his order,  and so he revokes the sale, is that he must only take back the silver, gold, or price  which he paid exactly. He does not buy anything else from the man for the same  price until he has got back what he paid. That is because if he took something else  besides the price which he paid him or exchanged it for goods other than the goods  which he bought from him, it would be selling food before getting delivery of it.\"  Malik said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  forbade selling food before getting delivery of it.\"  Malik said that it was not good if the buyer regretted his purchase and asked the  seller to revoke the sale for him and he would not press him immediately for what he  had paid. The people of knowledge forbade that. That was because when the food  was made ready for the buyer by the seller, the buyer deferred his due from the seller  in order that he might revoke the sale for him. That was the sale of food with delayed  terms before taking delivery of the food.  Malik said, \"The explanation of that is that when the date of delivery comes and the  buyer dislikes the food, the seller takes by it money to be paid later and so it is not  revocation. Revocation is that in which neither the buyer nor the seller is increased.  When increase occurs by deferment of payment for a time period, or by anything  which increases one of them over the other or anything which gives one of them  profit, it is not revocation. When either of them do that, revocation becomes a sale.  There is an indulgence for revocation, partnership, and transfer, as long as i ncrease,  decrease, or deferment does not come into them. If increase, decrease, or deferment  comes into it, it becomes a sale. Whatever makes a sale halal makes it halal and  whatever makes a sale haram makes it haram.\"  Malik said, \"If someone pays in advance for Syrian wheat, there is no harm if he  takes a load after the term falls due.\"  Malik said, \"It is the same with whoever advances for any kind of thing. There is no  harm in him taking better than whatever he has made an advance for or worse than it  after the agreed delivery date. The explanation of that is that if, for instance, a man  advances for a certain weight of wheat. There is no harm if he decides to take some  barley or Syrian wheat. If he has made an advance for good dates, there is no harm if  he decides to take poor quality dates. If he paid in advance for red raisins, there is no  harm if he takes black ones, when it happens after the agreed delivery date, and when  the measure of what he takes is like the measure of what he paid for in advance.\"  Section: Bartering Food for Food with No Increase between Them"

Malik said, \"This is the way of doing things among us . \"  Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things among us is that wheat is  not sold for wheat, dates for dates, wheat for dates, dates for raisins, wheat for  raisins, nor any kind of food sold for food at all, except from hand to hand. If there is  any sort of delayed terms in the transaction, it is not good. It is haram. Condiments  are not bartered except from hand to hand.\"  Malik said, \"Food and condiments are not bartered when they are the same type, two  of one kind for one of the other. A mudd of wheat is not sold for two mudds of  wheat, nor a mudd of dates for two mudds of dates, nor a mudd of raisins for two  mudds of raisins, nor is anything of that sort done with grains and condiments when  they are of one kind, even if it is hand to hand.  \"This is the same position as silver for silver and gold for gold. No increase is halal  in the transaction, and only like for like, from hand to hand is halal.\"  Malik said, \"If there is a clear difference in foodstuffs which are measured and  weighed, there is no harm in taking two of one kind for one of another, hand to hand.  There is no harm in taking a sa of dates for two sa of wheat, and a sa of dates for two  sa of raisins, and a sa of wheat for two sa of ghee. If the two sorts in the transaction  are different, there is no harm in two for one or more than that from hand to hand. If  delayed terms enter into the sale, it is not halal .\"  Malik said, \"It is not halal to trade a heap of wheat for a heap of wheat. There is no  harm in a heap of wheat for a heap of dates, from hand to hand. That is because there  is no harm in buying wheat with dates without precise measurement.\"  Malik said, \"With kinds of foods and condiments that differ from each other, and the  difference is clear, there is no harm in bartering one kind for another, without precise  measurement from hand to hand. If delayed terms enter into the sale, there is no good  in it. Bartering such things without precise measurement is like buying it with gold  and silver without measuring precisely.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 21 of 41 Malik said, \"That is because you buy wheat with silver without measuring precisely,  and dates with gold without measuring precisely, and it is halal. There is no harm in  it.\"  Malik said, \"It is not good for someone to make a heap of food, knowing its measure  and then to sell it as if it had not been measured precisely, concealing its measure  from the buyer. If the buyer wants to return that food to the seller, he can, because he  concealed its measure and so it is an uncertain transaction. This is done with any  kind of food or other goods whose measure and number the seller knows, and which  he then sells without measurement and the buyer does not know that. If the buyer  wants to return that to the seller, he can return t. The people of knowledge still forbid  such a transaction.\"  Malik said, \"There is no good in selling one round loaf of bread for two round  loaves, nor large for small when some of them are bigger than others. When care is  taken that they are like for like, there is no harm in the sale, even if they are not  weighed.\"  Malik said, \"It is not good to sell a mudd of butter and a mudd of milk for two mudds  of butter. This is like what we described of selling dates when two sa of kabis and a  sa of poor quality dates were sold for three sa of ajwa dates after the buyer had said  to the seller, 'Two sa of kabis dates for three sa of ajwa dates is not good,' and then  he did that to make the transaction possible. The owner of the milk puts the milk with  his butter so that he can use the superiority of his butter over the butter of the other  party to put his milk in with it.\"  Malik said, \"Flour for wheat is like for like, and there is no harm in that. That is if he  does not mix up anything with the flour and sell it for wheat, like for like. Had he put  half a mudd of flour and half of wheat, and then sold that for a mudd of wheat, it  would be like what we described, and it would not be good because he would want to  use the superiority of his good wheat to put flour along with it.

The one who owed the  food said to his creditor, \"I will refer you to my debtor who owes me the same  amount of food as I owe you, so that you may obtain the food which I owe you .\"  Malik said, \"If the man who had to deliver the food, had gone out, and bought the  food to pay off his creditor, that is not good.

They do not consider it as a sale. It is like a man lending light dirhams. He  is then paid back in dirhams of full weight, and so gets back more than he lent. That  is halal for him and permitted.

This is an  uncertain transaction because what comes from the ben-nut is ben-oil.

The explanation of why it is so, is that it is as if the seller hired the buyer for the  profit if the goods make a profit. If he sells the stock at a loss, he has nothing, and his  efforts are not compensated. This is not good. In such a transaction, the buyer should  have a wage according to the work that he has contributed. Whatever there is of loss  or profit in those goods is for and against the seller. This is only when the goods are  gone and sold. If they do not go, the transaction between them is null and void.\"  Malik said, \"As for a man who buys goods from a man and he concludes the sale and  then the buyer regrets and asks to have the price reduced and the seller refuses and  says, 'Sell it and I will compensate you for any loss.'

What made it  different was that it was a common practice and it was what people were familiar  with, and what people had done in the past, and it was still among the permitted  transactions and trading of people in which they saw no harm because in the sale of  bundles with a list of contents without undoing them, an uncertain transaction was  not intended and it did not resemble mulamasa."

As for  the cost of transporting the drapery, it is included in the basic price, and no share of  the profit is allocated to it unless the agent tells all of that to the investor. If they  agree to share the profits accordingly after knowledge of it, there is no harm in that.\"  Malik said, \"As for bleaching, tailoring, dyeing, and such things, they are treated in  the same way as drapery. The profit is reckoned in them as it is reckoned in drapery  goods. So if he sells the drapery goods without clarifying the things we named as not  getting profit, and if the drapery has already gone, the transport is to be reckoned, but  no profit is given. If the drapery goods have not gone the transaction between them is  null and void unless they make a new mutual agreement on what is to be permitted  between them .\"  Malik spoke about an agent who bought goods for gold or silver, and the exchange  rate on the day of purchase was ten dirhams to the dinar. He took them to a city to  sell murabaha, or sold them where he purchased them according to the exchange rate  of the day on which he sold them. If he bought them for dirhams and he sold them  for dinars, or he bought them for dinars and he sold them for dirhams, and the goods  had not gone then he had a choice. If he wished, he accepted to sell the goods and if  he wished, he left them. If the goods had been sold, he had the price for which the  salesman bought them, and the salesman was reckoned to have the profit on what  they were bought for, over what the investor gained as profit.  Malik said, \"If a man sells goods worth one hundred dinars for one hundred and ten,  and he hears after that they are worth ninety dinars, and the goods have gone, the  seller has a choice. If he likes, he has the price of the goods on the day they were  taken from him unless the price is more than the price for which he was obliged to  sell them in the first place, and he does not have more than that - and it is one  hundred and ten dinars. If he likes, it is counted as profit against ninety unless the  price his goods reached was less than the value. He is given the choice between what  his goods fetch and the capital plus the profit, which is ninety-nine dinars.\"  Malik said, \"If someone sells goods in murabaha and he says, 'It was valued at one  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 31: Business Transactions  Page 32 of 41 hundred dinars to me.' Then he hears later on, that it was worth one hundred and  twenty dinars, the customer is given the choice. If he wishes, he gives the salesman  the value of the goods on the day he took them, and if he wishes, he gives the price  for which he bought them according to the reckoning of what profit he gives him, as  far as it goes, unless that is less than the price for which he bought them, for he  should not give the owner of the goods a loss from the price for which he bought  them because he was satisfied with that. The owner of the goods came to seek extra,  so the buyer has no argument against the salesman in that to make a reduction from  the first price for which he bought it according to the list of contents.\"  Section: Sale according to List of Contents"

Shall I give you such-and-such profit to take over your portion?\"  This person agreed, and the man gave him the profit and became a partner in his  place. When he looked at the purchase, he saw that it was ugly and found it too  expensive.  Malik said, \"It is obliged on him and there is no choice in it for him if he bought it  according to a list of contents and the description was well-known.\"  Malik spoke about a man who had drapery goods sent to him, and salesmen came to  him and he read to them his list of contents and said, \"In each bag is such-and-such a  wrap from Basra and such-and-such a light wrap from Sabir.

That is because to buy that is an uncertain transaction and one does not know  whether the transaction will be completed or not completed.\"  He said, \"The explanation of what is disapproved of in buying a debt owed by  someone absent or dead, is that it is not known what unknown debtor may be  connected to the dead person. If the dead person is liable for another debt, the price  which the buyer gave on strength of the debt may become worthless.\"  Malik said, \"There is another fault in that as well. He is buying something which is  not guaranteed for him, and so if the deal is not completed, what he paid becomes  worthless. This is an uncertain transaction and it is not good.\"  Malik said, \"One distinguishes between a man who is only selling what he actually  has and a man who is being paid in advance for something which is not yet in his  possession.

Malik said, \"That is not good. When he says, 'Pay for me  and I will sell it for you,' it becomes a loan which he makes to him in order that he  sell it for him and if those goods are destroyed, or pass, the man who paid the price  will demand from his partner what he put in for him. This is part of the advance  which brings in profit.\"  Malik said, \"If a man buys goods, and they are settled for him, and then a man says  to him, 'Share half of these goods with me, and I will sell them all for you,' that is  halal, there is no harm in it.

If the share-cropper stipulates that the seeds are the responsibility of the owner of the  property - that is not permitted because he has stipulated an outlay against the owner  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 33: Sharecropping  Page 2 of 5 of the property. Share-cropping is conducted on the basis that all the care and  expense is outlayed by the share-cropper, and the owner of the property is not  obliged anything. This is the accepted method of share-cropping.\"  Malik spoke about a spring which was shared between two men, and then the water  dried up and one of them wanted to work on the spring and the other said, \"I don't  have the means to work on it.\" He said, \"Tell the one who wants to work on the  spring, 'Work and expend. All the water will be yours. You will have its water until  your companion brings you half of what you have spent. If he brings you half of  what you have spent, he can take his share of the water.' The first one is given all the  water, because he has spent on it, and if he does not reach anything by his work, the  other has not incurred any expense.\"  Malik said, \"It is not good for a share-cropper not to expend anything but his labour  and to be hired for a share of the fruit while all the expense and work is incurred by  the owner of the garden, because the share-cropper does not know what the exact  wage is going to be for his labour, whether it will be little or great.\"  Malik said, \"No-one who lends a qirad or grants a share-cropping contract, should  exempt some of the wealth, or some of the trees from his agent, because, by that, the  agent becomes his hired man. He says, 'I will grant you a share-crop provided that  you work for me on such-and-such a palm - water it and tend it. I will give you a  qirad for such-and-such money provided that you work for me with ten dinars. They  are not part of the qirad I have given you.' That must not be done and it is not good.  This is what is done in our community.\"  Malik said, \"The sunna about what is permitted to an owner of a garden in  share-cropping is that he can stipulate to the share-cropper the maintenance of walls,  cleaning the spring, sweeping the irrigation canals, pollinating the palms, pruning  branches, harvesting the fruit and such things, provided that the share-cropper has a  share of the fruit fixed by mutual agreement. However, the owner cannot stipulate  the beginning of new work which the agent will start digging a well, raising the  source of a well, instigating new planting, or building a cistern whose cost is great.  That is as if the owner of the garden said to a certain man, 'Build me a house here or  dig me a well or make a spring flow for me or do some work for me for half the fruit  of this garden of mine,' before the fruit of the garden is sound and it is halal to sell it.  This is the sale of fruit before its good condition is clear. The Messenger of Allah,  may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade fruit to be sold before its good  condition became clear.\"  Malik said, \"If the fruits are good and their good condition is clear and selling them  is halal and then the owner asks a man to do one of those jobs for him, specifying the  job, for half the fruit of his garden, for example, there is no harm in that. He has  hired the man for something recognised and known. The man has seen it and is  satisfied with it.  \"As for share-cropping, if the garden has no fruit or little or bad fruit, he has only  that. The labourer is only hired for a set amount, and hire is only permitted on these  terms. Hire is a type of sale. One man buys another man's work from him. It is not  good if uncertainty enters into it because the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 33: Sharecropping  Page 3 of 5 him and grant him peace, forbade uncertain transactions.\"  Malik said, \"The sunna in share-cropping with us is that it can be practised with any  kind of fruit tree, palm, vine, olive tree, pomegranate, peach, and soon. It is  permitted, and there is no harm in it provided that the owner of the property has a  share of the fruit: a half or a third or a quarter or whatever.\"  Malik said, \"Share-cropping is also permitted in any crop which emerges from the  earth if it is a crop which is picked, and its owner cannot water, work on it and tend  it.  \"Share-cropping becomes reprehensible in anything in which share-cropping is  normally permitted if the fruit is sound and the good condition is clear and it is halal  to sell it. He must share-crop in it the next year. If a man waters fruit whose good  condition is clear and it is halal to sell it, and he picks it for the owner, for a share of  the crop, it is not sharecropping. It is similar to him being paid in dirhams and dinars.  Share-cropping is what is between pruning the palms and when the fruit becomes  sound and its sale is halal.\"  Malik said, \"If some one makes a share-cropping contract for fruit trees before the  condition becomes clear and its sale is halal, it is share-cropping and is permitted . \"  Malik said, \"Uncultivated land must not be involved in a share-cropping contract.  That is because it is halal for the owner to rent it for dinars and dirhams or the  equivalent for an accepted price.\"  Malik said, \"As for a man who gives his uncultivated earth for a third or a fourth of  what comes out of it, that is an uncertain transaction because crops may be scant one  time and plentiful another time. It may perish completely and the owner of the land  will have abandoned a set rent which would have been good for him to rent the land  for. He takes an uncertain situation, and does not know whether or not it will be  satisfactory. This is disapproved. It is like a man having someone travel for him for a  set amount, and then saying, 'Shall I give you a tenth of the profit of the journey as  your wage?' This is not halal and must not be done.\"  Malik summed up,\"A man must not hire out himself or his land or his ship unless for  a set amount.\"  Malik said, \"A distinction is made between sharecropping in palms and in cultivated  land because the owner of the palms cannot sell the fruit until its good condition is  clear. The owner of the land can rent it when it is uncultivated with nothing on it.\"  Malik said, \"What is done in our community about palms is that they can also be  share-cropped for three and four years, and less or more than that.\"  Malik said, \"That is what I have heard. Any fruit trees like that are in the position of  palms. Contracts for several years are permissible for the sharecropper as they are  permissible in the palms.\"  Malik said about the owner, \"He does not take anything additional from the  share-cropper in the way of gold or silver or crops which increases him. That is not  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 33: Sharecropping  Page 4 of 5 good. The share-cropper also must not take from the owner of the garden anything  additional which will increase him of gold, silver, crops or anything. Increase beyond  what is stipulated in the contract is not good. It is also not good for the lender of a  qirad to be in this position. If such an increase does enter share-cropping or quirad, it  becomes by it hire. It is not good when hire enters it. Hire must never occur in a  situation which has uncertainty in it.\"  Malik spoke about a man who gave land to another man in a share-cropping contract  in which there were palms, vines, or the like of that of fruit trees and there was also  uncultivated land in it. He said, \"If the uncultivated land is secondary to the fruit  trees, either in importance or in size of land, there is no harm in share-cropping. That  is if the palms take up two-thirds of the land or more, and the uncultivated land is a  third or less. This is because when the land that the fruit trees take up is secondary to  the uncultivated land and the cultivated land in which the palms, vines or the like is a  third or less, and the uncultivated land is two-thirds or more, it is permitted to rent  the land and share-cropping in it is haram.\"  \"One of the practices of people is to give out sharecropping contracts on property  with fruit trees when there is uncultivated land in it, and to rent land while there are  fruit trees on it, just as a Qur'an or sword which has some embellishment on it of  silver is sold for silver, or a necklace or ring which have stones and gold in them are  sold for dinars. These sales continue to be permitted. People buy and sell by them.  Nothing described or instituted has come on that which if exceeded, makes it haram,  and if fallen below makes it halal. What is done in our community about that is what  people practise and permit among themselves. That is, if the gold or silver is  secondary to what it is incorporated in, it is permitted to sell it. That is, if the value of  the blade, the Qur'an, or the stones is two-thirds or more, and the value of the  decoration is one-third or less.\"  Section: The Condition About Slaves in Sharecropping"

They are like  the property. There is no profit in them for the share-cropper except to lighten some  of his burden. If they did not come with the property, his toil would be harder. It is  like share-cropping land with a spring or land with a watering trough. You will not  find anyone who receives the same share for share-cropping two lands which are  equal in property and yield, when one property has a constant plentiful spring and the  other has a watering trough, because of the lightness of working land with a spring,  and the hardship of working land with a watering trough.\"  Malik added, \"That is what is done in our community.\"  Malik said, \"A share-cropper cannot employ workers from the property in other  work, and he cannot make that a stipulation with the one who gives him the  share-cropping contract.

The share-cropping of property is based on the state which it is  currently in.\"  \"If the owner of the property wants to remove one of the slaves of the property, he  removes him before the share-cropping, or if he wants to put someone into the  property, he does it before the share-cropping.

    "text": "Malik related to me that he heard the like of that from Sulayman ibn Yasar.  Malik spoke about a man who bought out one of the partners in a shared property, by  paying the man with an animal, a slave, a slave-girl, or the equivalent of that in  goods. Then another partner decided to exercise his right of pre-emption after that,  and he found that the slave or slave-girl had died, and no one knew what her value  had been. The buyer claimed, \"The value of the slave or slave-girl was 100 dinars.\"  The partner with the right of pre-emption claimed, \"The value was 50 dinars.\"  Malik said, \"The buyer takes an oath that the value of what he payed was 100 dinars.  Then if the one with the right of pre-emption wishes, he can compensate him, or else  he can leave it, unless he can bring a clear proof that the slave or slave-girl's value is  less than what the buyer said. If someone gives away his portion of a shared house or  land and the recipient repays him for it by cash or goods, the partners can take it by  pre-emption if they wish and pay off the recipient the value of what he gave in dinars  or dirhams. If someone makes a gift of his portion of a shared house or land, and  does not take any remuneration and does not seek to, and a partner wants to take it  for its value, he cannot do so as long as the original partner has not been given  recompense for it. If there is any recompense, the one with the right of pre-emption  can have it for the price of the recompense.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 35: Pre-emption in Prop... Page 2 of 4 Malik spoke about a man who bought into a piece of shared land for a price on  credit, and one of the partners wanted to possess it by right of pre-emption . Malik  said, \"If it seems likely that the partner can meet the terms, he has right of  pre-emption for the same credit terms. If it is feared that he will not be able to meet  the terms, but he can bring a wealthy and reliable guarantor of equal standing to the  one who bought into the land, he can also take possession.\"  Malik said, \"A person's absence does not sever his right of pre-emption. Even if he is  a way for a long time, there is no time limit after which the right of preemption is cut  off.\"  Malik said that if a man left land to a number of his children, then one of them who  had a child died and the child of the deceased sold his right in that land, the brother  of the seller was more entitled to pre-empt him than his paternal uncles, the partners  of his father.  Malik said, \"This is what is done in our community.\"  Malik said, \"Pre-emption is shared between partners according to their existing  shares. Each of them takes according to his portion. If it is small, he has little. If it is  great, it is according to that. That is if they are tenacious and contend with each other  about it.\"  Malik said, \"As for a man who buys out the share of one of his partners, and one of  the other partners says, 'I will take a portion according to my share,' and the first  partner says, 'If you wish to take all the preemption, I will give it up to you. If you  wish to leave it, then leave it.' If the first partner gives him the choice and hands it  over to him, the second partner can only take all the pre-emption or give it back. If  he takes it, he is entitled to it. If not, he has nothing.\"  Malik spoke about a man who bought land, and developed it by planting trees or  digging a well etc., and then someone came, and seeing that he had a right in the  land, wanted to take possession of it by pre-emption. Malik said \"He has no right of  preemption unless he compensates the other for his expenditure. If he gives him the  price of what he has developed, he is entitled to pre-emption . If not, he has no right  in it.\"  Malik said that someone who sold off his portion of a shared house or land and then,  on learning that some one with a right of pre-emption was to take possession by that  right, asked the buyer to revoke the sale, and he did so, did not have the right to do  that. The pre-emptor has more right to the property for the price for which he sold it.  In the case of some one who bought along with a section of a shared house or land,  an animal and goods (that were not shared), so that when any one demanded his right  of pre-emption in the house or land he said, \"Take what I have bought altogether, for  I bought it altogether,\" Malik said, \"The pre-emptor need only take possession of the  house or land. Each thing the man bought is assessed according to its share of the  lump sum the man paid. Then the pre-emptor takes possession of his right for a price  which is appropriate on that basis. He does not take any animals or goods unless he  wants to do that.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 35: Pre-emption in Prop... Page 3 of 4 Malik said, \"If someone sells a section of shared land, and one of those who have the  right of preemption surrenders it to the buyer and another refuses to do other than  take his pre-emption, the one who refuses to surrender has to take all the preemption,  and he cannot take according to his right and leave what remains.  In the case where one of a number of partners in one house sold his share when all  his partners were away except for one man, the one present was given the choice of  either taking the pre-emption or leaving it, and he said, 'I will take my portion and  leave the portions of my partners until they are present. If they take it, that is that. If  they leave it, I will take all the pre-emption,' Malik said, 'He can only take it all or  leave it. If his partners come, they can take from him or leave it as they wish. If this  is offered to him and he does not accept, I think that he has no pre-emption.' \"  Section: Cases in Which Pre-Emption Is Not Possible"

Malik said,  \"They cannot do that until the buyer has taken possession and the sale is confirmed  for him. When the sale is confirmed, they have the right of pre-emption.\"  Malik spoke about a man who bought land and it remained in his hands for some  time. Then a man came and saw that he had a share of the land by inheritance. Malik  said, \"If the man's right of inheritance is established, he also has a right of  preemption. If the land has produced a crop, the crop belongs to the buyer until the  day when the right of the other is established, because he has tended what was  planted against being destroyed or being carried away by a flood.\"  Malik continued, \"If the time has been long, or the witnesses are dead or the seller  has died, or the buyer has died, or they are both alive and the basis of the sale and  purchase has been forgotten because of the length of time, pre-emption is  discontinued. A man only takes his right by inheritance which has been established  for him. If his situation differs from this, because the sale transaction is recent and he  sees that the seller has concealed the price in order to sever his right of pre-emption,  the value of the land is estimated, and he buys the land for that price by his right of  pre-emption. Then the buildings, plants, or structures which are extra to the land are  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 35: Pre-emption in Prop... Page 4 of 4 looked at, so he is in the position of some one who bought the land for a known  price, and then after that built on it and planted.

If the family of the deceased fear to break up the property  of the deceased, then they share it and sell it, and they have no pre-emption in it.\"  Malik said, \"There is no pre-emption among us in a slave or a slave-girl or a camel, a  cow, sheep, or any animal, nor in clothes or a well which does not have any  uncultivated land around it. Pre-emption is in what can be usefully divided, and in  land in which boundaries occur. As for what cannot be usefully divided, there is no  pre-emption in it.\"  Malik said, \"Some one who buys land in which people who are present have a right  of pre-emption, refers them to the Sultan and either they claim their right or the  Sultan surrenders it to him. If he were to leave them, and not refer their situation to  the Sultan and they knew about his purchase, and then they left it until a long time  had passed and then came demanding their pre-emption, I do not think that they  would have it.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 36: Judgements  Page 1 of 23"

If he  draws back and refuses to take an oath, the defendant is made to take an oath. If he  takes an oath, the claim against him is dropped. If he refuses to take an oath, the  claim is confirmed against him.\"  Malik said, \"This procedure pertains to property cases in particular. It does not occur  in any of the hadd-punishments, nor in marriage, divorce, freeing slaves, theft or  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 36: Judgements  Page 3 of 23 slander. If some one says, 'Freeing slaves comes under property,' he has erred. It is  not as he said. Had it been as he said, a slave could take an oath with one witness, if  he could find one, that his master had freed him.  \"However, when a slave lays claim to a piece of property, he can take an oath with  one witness and demand his right as the freeman demands his right.\"  Malik said, \"The sunna with us is that when a slave brings somebody who witnesses  that he has been set free, his master is made to take an oath that he has not freed him,  and the slave's claim is dropped.\"  Malik said, \"The sunna about divorce is also like that with us. When a woman brings  somebody who witnesses that her husband has divorced her, the husband is made to  take an oath that he has not divorced her. If he takes the oath, the divorce does not  proceed . \"  Malik said, \"There is only one sunna of bringing a witness in cases of divorce and  freeing a slave. The right to make an oath only belongs to the husband of the woman,  and the master of the slave. Freeing is a hadd matter, and the testimony of women is  not permitted in it because when a slave is freed, his inviolability is affirmed and the  hadd punishments are applied for and against him. If he commits fornication and he  is a muhsan, he is stoned. If he kills a slave, he is killed for it. Inheritance is  established for him, between him and whoever inherits from him. If somebody  disputes this, arguing that if a man frees his slave and then a man comes to demand  from the master of the slave payment of a debt, and a man and two women testify to  his right, that establishes the right against the master of the slave so that his freeing  him is cancelled if he only has the slave as property, inferring by this case that the  testimony of women is permitted in cases of setting free. The case is not as he  suggests (i.e. it is a case of property not freeing). It is like a man who frees his slave,  and then the claimant of a debt comes to the master and takes an oath with one  witness, demanding his right. By that, the freeing of the slave would be cancelled. Or  else a man comes who has frequent dealings and transactions with the master of the  slave. He claims that he is owed money by the master of the slave. Someone says to  the master of the slave, 'Take an oath that you don't owe what he claims'. If he draws  back and refuses to take an oath, the one making the claim takes an oath and his right  against the master of the slave is confirmed. That would cancel the freeing of the  slave if it is confirmed that property is owed by the master.\"  Malik said, \"It is the same case with a man who marries a slave-girl and then the  master of the slave-girl comes to the man who has married her and claims, 'You and  so-and-so have bought my slave-girl from me for such an amount of dinars. The  husband of the slave-girl denies that. The master of the slave-girl brings a man and  two women and they testify to what he has said. The sale is confirmed and his claim  is considered true. So the slave-girl is haram for her husband and they have to  separate, even though the testimony of women is not accepted in divorce.\"  Malik said, \"It is also the same case with a man who accuses a free man, so the hadd  falls on him. A man and two women come and testify that the one accused is a slave.  That would remove the hadd from the accused after it had befallen him, even though  the testimony of women is not accepted in accusations involving hadd punishments.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 36: Judgements  Page 4 of 23 Malik said, \"Another similar case in which judgement appears to go against the  precedent of the sunna is that two women testify that a child is born alive and so it is  necessary for him to inherit if a situation arises where he is entitled to inherit, and the  child's property goes to those who inherit from him, if he dies, and it is not necessary  that the two women witnesses should be accompanied by a man or an oath even  though it may involve vast properties of gold, silver, live-stock, gardens and slaves  and other properties. However, had two women testified to one dirham or more or  less than that in a property case, their testimony would not affect anything and would  not be permitted unless there was a witness or an oath with them.\"  Malik said, \"There are people who say that an oath is not acceptable with only one  witness and they argue by the word of Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, and His word  is the Truth, 'And call in to witness two witnesses, men; or if the two be not men,  then one man and two women, such witnesses as you approve of.' (Sura 2 ayat 282).  Such people argue that if he does not bring one man and two women, he has no  claim and he is not allowed to take an oath with one witness.\"  Malik said, \"Part of the proof against those who argue this, is to reply to them, 'Do  you think that if a man claimed property from a man, the one claimed from would  not swear that the claim was false?' If he swears, the claim against him is dropped. If  he refuses to take an oath, the claimant is made to take an oath that his claim is true,  and his right against his companion is established. There is no dispute about this with  any of the people nor in any country. By what does he take this? In what place in the  Book of Allah does he find it? So if he confirms this, let him confirm the oath with  one witness, even if it is not in the Book of Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic! It is  enough that this is the precedent of the sunna. However, man wants to recognise the  proper course of action and the location of the proof. In this there is a clarification for  what is obscure about that, if Allah ta'ala wills.\"  Section: Judgement on a Deceased with a Debt against Him and a Debt for  Him, and only One Witness  Book 36, Number 36.5.7a:  Yahya said that Malik spoke about a man who died and had a debt owing to him and  there was one witness, and some people had a debt against him and they had only  one witness, and his heirs refused to take an oath on their rights with their witness.  He said, \"The creditors take an oath and take their rights. If there is anything left  over, the heirs do not take any of it. That is because the oaths were offered to them  before and they abandoned them, unless they say, 'We did not know that our  companion had extra,' and it is known that they only abandoned the oaths because of  that.

    "text": "Yahya said, \"Malik related to us from Ibn Shihab from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab that  the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'The pledge  given as security is not forfeited.' \"  Malik said, \"The explanation of that according to what we think - and Allah knows  best - is that a man gives a pledge to somebody in security for something. The pledge  is superior to that for which he pawned it. The pledger says to the pawn-broker, 'I  will bring you your due, after such-and-such a time. If not, the pledge is yours for  what it was pawned for.' \"  Malik said, \"This transaction is not good and it is not halal. This is what was  forbidden. If the owner brings what he pledged it for after the period, it is his. I think  that the time condition is void.\"  Section: Judgement on Pledging Fruit and Animals as Security  Book 36, Number 36.11.13a:  Yahya said, \"I heard Malik say that if a man pledges his garden for a stated period  and the fruits of that garden are ready before the end of that period, the fruits are not  included in the pledge with the real estate, unless it is stipulated by the pledger in his  pledge. However, if a man receives a slave-girl as a pledge and she is pregnant or she  becomes pregnant after his taking her as a pledge, her child is included with her.  \"A distinction is made between the fruit and the child of the slave-girl. The  Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, 'If someone  sells a palm which has been pollinated, the fruit belongs to the seller unless the buyer  stipulates its inclusion.' The undisputed way of doing things in our community is that  if a man sells a slave-girl or an animal with a foetus in its womb, the foetus belongs  to the buyer, whether or not the buyer stipulates it. The palm is not like the animal.  Fruit is not like the foetus in its mother's womb. Part of what clarifies that is also that  it is the usage of people to have a man pawn the fruit of the palm apart from the  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 36: Judgements  Page 7 of 23 palm. No one pawns the foetus in its mother's womb whether of slaves or animals.\"  Section: Judgement on Pledging Animals as Security  Book 36, Number 36.12.13b:  Yahya said that he had heard Malik say, \"The undisputed way of doing things in our  community concerning pledges is that in cases where land or a house or an animal  are known to have been destroyed whilst in the possession of the broker of the  pledge, and the circumstances of the loss are known, the loss is against the pledger.  There is no deduction made from what is due to the broker at all. Any pledge which  perishes in the possession of the broker and the circumstances of its loss are only  known by his word, the loss is against the broker and he is liable for its value. He is  asked to describe whatever was destroyed and then he is made to take an oath about  that description and what he loaned on security for it. \"Then people of discernment  evaluate the description. If the pledge was worth more than what the broker loaned,  the pledger takes the extra. If the assessed value of the pledge is less than what he  was loaned, the pledger is made to take an oath as to what the broker loaned and he  does not have to pay the extra which the broker loaned above the assessed value of  the pledge. If the pledger refuses to take an oath, he has to give the broker the extra  above the assessed value of the pledge. If the broker says that he doesn't know the  value of the pledge, the pledger is made to take an oath on the description of the  pledge and that is his if he brings a matter which is not disapproved of.\"  Malik said, \"All this applies when the broker takes the pledge and does not put it in  the hands of another.\"  Section: Judgement on Pledges between Two Men  Book 36, Number 36.13.13c:  Yahya said that he heard Malik speak about two men who had a pledge between  them. One of them undertook to sell his pledge, and the other one had asked him to  wait a year for his due. He said, \"If it is possible to divide the pledge, and the due of  the one who asked him to wait will not be decreased, half the pledge which is  between them is sold for him and he is given his due. If it is feared that his right will  be decreased, all the pledge is sold, and the one who undertook to sell his pledge is  given his due from that. If the one who asked him to wait for his due is pleased in  himself, half of the price is paid to the pledger. If not, the pledgee is made to take an  oath that he only asked him to wait so that he could transfer my pledge to me in its  form.' Then he is given his due immediately.\"  Yahya said that he heard Malik say about a slave whose master had pledged him and  the slave had property of his own, \"The property of the slave is not part of the pledge  unless the broker stipulates that.\"  Section: Judgement on Pledges in General  Book 36, Number 36.14.13d:  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 36: Judgements  Page 8 of 23 Yahya said that he heard Malik speak about someone who pledged goods as security  for a loan, and they perished with the broker. The one who took out the loan  confirmed its specification. They agreed on the amount of the loan, but challenged  each other about the value of the pledge, the pledger saying that it had been worth  twenty dinars, whilst the broker said that it had been worth only ten, and that the  amount loaned on security was twenty dinars. Malik said, \"It is said to the one in  whose hand the pledge is, 'describe it.' If he describes it he is made to take an oath on  it and then the people of experience evaluate that description. If the value is more  than what was loaned on security for it, it is said to the broker, 'Return the rest of his  due to the pledger.' If the value is less than what was loaned on security for it, the  broker takes the rest of his due from the pledger. If the value is the exact amount of  the loan, the pledge is compensated for by the loan.\"  Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"What is done in our community about two men  who have a dispute about an amount of money loaned on the security of a pledge -  the pledger claiming that he pledged it for ten dinars and the broker insisting that he  took the pledge as security for twenty dinars, and the pledge is clearly in the  possession of the broker - is that the broker is made to take an oath when the value of  the pledge is fully known. If the value of the pledge is exactly what he swore that he  had loaned on security for it, the broker takes the pledge as his right. He is more  entitled to take precedence with an oath since he has possession of the pledge. If the  owner of the pledge wants to give him the amount which he swore that he was owed,  he can take the pledge back. If the pledge is worth less than the twenty dinars he  loaned, then it is said to the pledger, 'Either you give him what he has sworn to and  take your pledge back, or you swear to what you said you pledged it for.' If the  pledger takes the oath, then what the broker has increased over the value of the  pledge will become invalid. If the pledger does not take an oath, he must pay what  the broker swore to.\"  Malik said, \"If a pledge given on security for a loan perishes, and both parties deny  each other's rights, with the broker who is owed the loan saying that he gave twenty  dinars, and the pledger who owes the loan saying that he was given only ten, and  with the broker who is owed the loan saying the pledge was worth ten dinars, and the  broker who owes the loan saying it was worth twenty, then the broker who is owed  the loan is asked to describe the pledge. If he describes it, he must take an oath on its  description. Then people with experience of it evaluate that description. If the value  of the pledge is estimated to be more than what the broker claims it was, he takes an  oath as to what he claimed, and the pledger is given what is over from the value of  the pledge. If its value is less than what the broker claims of it, he is made to take an  oath as to what he claims is his. Then he demands settlement according to the actual  value of the pledge. The one who owes the loan is then made to take an oath on the  extra amount which remains owing against him to the claimant after the price of the  pledge is reached. That is because the broker becomes a claimant against the pledger.  If he takes an oath, the rest of what the broker swore to of what he claimed above the  value of the pledge is invalidated. If he draws back, he is bound to pay what remains  due to the broker after the value of the pledge.\"  Section: Judgement on Renting Animals and Going Beyond Specified  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 36: Judgements  Page 9 of 23 Destinations  Book 36, Number 36.15.13e:  Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"What is done in our community about a man  who rents an animal for a journey to a specified place and then he goes beyond that  place and further, is that the owner of the animal has a choice. If he wants to take  extra rent for his animal to cover the distance overstepped, he is given that on top of  the first rent and the animal is returned. If the owner of the animal likes to sell the  animal from the place where he over-steps, he has the price of the animal on top of  the rent. If, however, the hirer rented the animal to go and return and then he  overstepped when he reached the city to which he rented him, the owner of the  animal only has half the first rent. That is because half of the rent is going, and half  of it is returning. If he oversteps with the animal, only half of the first rent is obliged  for him. Had the animal died when he reached the city to which it was rented, the  hirer would not be liable and the renter would only have half the rent.\"  Malik said, \"That is what is done with people who overstep and dispute about what  they took the animal for.\"  Malik said, \"It is also like that with some one who takes qirad-money from his  companion. The owner of the property says to him, 'Do not buy such-and-such  animals or such-and-such goods.' He names them and forbids them and disapproves  of his money being invested in them. The one who takes the money then buys what  he was forbidden. By that, he intends to be liable for the money and take the profit of  his companion. When he does that, the owner of the money has an option. If he  wants to enter with him in the goods according to the original stipulations between  them about the profit, he does so. If he likes, he has his capital guaranteed against the  one who took the capital and over stepped the mark.\"  Malik said, \"It is also like that with a man with whom another man invests some  goods. The owner of the property orders him to buy certain goods for him which he  names. He differs, and buys with the goods something other than what he was  ordered to buy. He exceeded his orders. The owner of the goods has an option. If he  wants to take what was bought with his property, he takes it. If he wants the partner  to be liable for his capital he has that.\"  Section: Judgement about Raped Women"

He is not obliged to replace it with a similar animal  nor does he compensate the owner with any kind of animal. He must pay its price on  the day it was consumed, and giving the value is more equitable in compensation for  animals and goods.\"  Yahya said that he heard Malik say about someone who consumes some food  without the permission of its owner, \"He returns to the owner a like weight of the  same kind of food. Food is in the position of gold and silver. Gold and silver are  returned with gold and silver. The animal is not in the position of gold in that. What  distinguishes between them is the sunna and the behaviour which is in force.  Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"If a man is entrusted with some wealth and then  trades with it for himself and makes a profit, the profit is his because he is  responsible for the property until he returns it to its owner. \"  Section: Judgement on Abandonment of Islam"

They are killed without being called to tawba  because their tawba is not recognised. They were hiding their kufr and publishing  their Islam, so I do not think that one calls such people to tawba, and one does not  accept their word. As for the one who goes out of Islam to something else and  divulges it, one calls him to tawba. If he does not turn in tawba, he is killed. If there  are people in that situation, I think that one should call them to Islam and call them to  tawba. If they turn in tawba, that is accepted from them. If they do not turn in tawba,  they are killed.

Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"To ransom them with their price is more  equitable in this case, Allah willing.\"  Section: Judgement on Inheritance of Attached Children  Book 36, Number 36.22.23a:  Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"The way of doing things generally agreed upon  in our community in the case of a man who dies and has sons and one of them  claims, 'My father confirmed that so-and-so was his son,' is that the relationship is  not established by the testimony of one man, and the confirmation of the one who  confirmed it is only permitted as regards his own share in the division of his father's  property. The one testified for is only given his due from the share of the testifier.\"  Malik said, \"An example of this is that a man dies leaving two sons, and 600 dinars.  Each of them takes 300 dinars. Then one of them testifies that his deceased father  confirmed that so-and-so was his son. The one who testifies is obliged to give 100  dinars to the one thus connected. This is half of the inheritance of the one thought to  be related, had he been related. If the other confirms him, he takes the other 100 and  so he completes his right and his relationship is established. His position is similar to  that of a woman who confirms a debt against her father or her husband and the other  heirs deny it. She must pay to the person whose debt she confirms, the amount  according to her share of the full debt, had it been confirmed against all the heirs. If  the woman inherits an eighth, she pays the creditor an eighth of his debt. If a  daughter inherits a half, she pays the creditor half of his debt. Whichever women  confirm him, pay him according to this.  Malik said, \"If a man's testimony is in agreement with what the woman testified to,  that so-and-so had a debt against his father, the creditor is made to take an oath with  one witness and he is given all his due. This is not the position with women because  a man's testimony is allowed and the creditor must take an oath with the testimony of  his witness, and take all his due. If he does not take an oath, he only takes from the  inheritance of the one who confirmed him according to his share of the debt, because  he confirmed his right and the other heirs denied it.

It was the same with the tailor and the gold-smith. They took an oath about  it unless they produced something they would not normally have been employed to  do.

Yahya said, \"I heard Malik speak about a dyer who was given a garment and he  made a mistake and gave it to another man and the one to whom he gave it wore it.  He said, 'The one who wore it has no damages against him, and the washer pays  damages to the owner of the garment.

If he wishes, he can have a reduction  according to what the burn or flaw detracts from the price of the garment and he can  keep the garment, or if he wishes to pay damages for what the cutting or dyeing has  decreased of the price of the garment and return it, he can do so.  \"If the buyer has dyed the garment with a dye which increases the value, the buyer  has an option. If he wishes, he has a reduction from the price of the garment  according to what the defect diminishes or if he wishes to become a partner with the  one who sold the garment he does so. The price of the garment with a burn or flaw is  looked at. If the price is ten dirhams, and the amount by which the dyeing increased  the value is five dirhams, then they are partners in the garment, each according to his  share.

When the illness is light,  and one does not fear for the sick person, he does with his property what he likes. If  the illness is such that his life is feared for, he can only dispose of a third of his  estate.\"  He said, \"It is the same with a woman who is pregnant. The beginning of pregnancy  is good news and joy. It is not illness and no fear because Allah the Blessed, the  Exalted, said in His Book, 'We gave her good news of Ishaq and after Ishaq, Yaqub.'

The beginning of this restriction is after six months. Allah, the Blessed,  the Exalted, said in His Book, 'Mothers suckle their children for two complete years.'  And He said, 'his bearing and weaning are thirty months.' (Sura 2 ayat 233).  \"When six months have passed for the pregnant woman from the day she conceived,  she is only permitted to dispose of a third of her property.\"  Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"A man who is advancing in the row for battle,  can only dispose of a third of his property.

What came down about the division of the fixed shares of inheritance in  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 37: Wills and Testaments  Page 4 of 7 the Book of Allah, the Mighty, the Exalted, abrogated it.\"  Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"The established sunna with us, in which there is  no dispute, is that it is not permitted for a testator to make a bequest (in addition to  the fixed share) in favour of an heir, unless the other heirs permit him. If some of  them permit him and others refuse, he is allowed to diminish the share of those who  have given their permission. Those who refuse take their full share from the  inheritance.  Yahya said that he heard Malik speak about an invalid who made a bequest and  asked his heirs to give him permission to make a bequest when he was so ill that he  only had command of a third of his property, and they gave him permission to leave  some of his heirs more than his third. Malik said, \"They cannot revoke that. Had they  been permitted to do so, every heir would have done that, and then, when the testator  died, they would take that for themselves and prevent him from bequeathing his third  and what was permitted to him with respect to his property.\"  Malik said, \"If he asks permission of his heirs to grant a bequest to an heir while he  is well and they give him permission, that is not binding on them. The heirs can  rescind that if they wish. That is because when a man is well, he is entitled to all his  property and can do what he wishes with it. If he wishes, he can spend all of it. He  can spend it and give sadaqa with it or give it to whomever he likes. His asking  permission of his heirs is permitted for the heirs, when they give him permission  when authority over all his property is closed off from him and nothing outside of the  third is permitted to him, and when they are more entitled to the two-thirds of his  property than he is himself. That is when their permission becomes relevant. If he  asks one of the heirs to give his inheritance to him when he is dying, and the heir  agrees and then the dying man does not dispose of it at all, it is returned to the one  who gave it unless the deceased said to him, 'So-and-so - (one of his heirs) - is weak,  and I would like you to give him your inheritance.' So he gives it to him. That is  permitted when the deceased specified it for him.\"  Malik said, \"When a man gives the dying man free use of his share of the  inheritance, and the dying man distributes some of it and some remains, it is returned  to the giver, after the man has died.\"  Yahya said that he heard Malik speak about someone who made a bequest and  mentioned that he had given one of his heirs something which he had not taken  possession of, so the heirs refused to permit that. Malik said, \"That gift returns to the  heirs as inheritance according to the Book of Allah because the deceased did not  mean that to be taken out of the third and the heirs do not have a portion in the third  (which the dying man is allowed to bequeath).\"  Section: Effeminate Men and Custody of Children"

She bore Asim ibn  Umar to him, and then he separated from her. Umar came to Quba and found his son  Asim playing in the courtyard of the mosque. He took him by the arm and placed  him before him on his mount. The grandmother of the child saw him and argued with  Umar about the child so they went to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq. Umar said, 'My son.' The  woman said, 'My son.' Abu Bakr said, 'Do not interfere between a child and its  mother.' Umar did not repeat his words.\"  Yahya said that he heard Malik say, \"This is what I would have done in that  situation.\"  Section: Liability for Defect Goods  Book 37, Number 37.7.6a:  Yahya said that he heard Malik speak about a man who bought goods - animals or  clothes or wares, and the sale was found not to be permitted so it was revoked and  the one who had taken the goods was ordered to return the owner his goods. Malik  said, \"The owner of the goods only has their value on the day they were taken from  him, and not on the day they are returned to him. That is because the man is liable for  them from the day he took them and whatever loss is in them after that is against  him. For that reason, their increase and growth are also his. A man may take the  goods at a time when they are selling well and are in demand, and then have to return  them at a time when they have fallen in price and no one wants them. For instance,  the man may take the goods from the other man, and sell them for ten dinars or keep  them while their price is that. Then he may have to return them while their price is  only a dinar. He should not go off with nine dinars from the man's property. Or  perhaps they are taken by the man, and he sells them for a dinar or keeps them, while  their price is only a dinar, then he has to return them, and their value on the day he  returns them is ten dinars. The one who took them does not have to pay nine dinars  from his property to the owner. He is only obliged to pay the value of what he took  possession of on the day it was taken .\"  He said, \"Part of what clarifies this is that when a thief steals goods, only their price  on the day he stole them is looked at. If cutting off the hand is necessary because of  it, that is done. If the cutting off is delayed, either because the thief is imprisoned  until his situation is examined or he flees and then is caught, the delay of the cutting  off of the hand does not make the hadd, which was obliged for him on the day he  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 37: Wills and Testaments  Page 6 of 7 stole, fall from him even if those goods become cheap after that. Nor does delay  oblige cutting off the hand if it was not obliged on the day he took those goods, even  if they become expensive after that.\"  Section: General Chapter on Making Judgement and Shying Away From It"

If he doesn't have the  money, he partially frees him.  Malik said, \"The generally agreed-on way of doing things among us in the case of  slave whose master makes a bequest to free part of him - a third, a fourth, a half, or  any share after his death, is that only the portion of him is freed that his master has  named. This is because the freeing of that portion is only obliged to take place after  the death of the master because the master has the option to withdraw the bequest as  long as he lives. When the slave is freed from his master, the master is a testator and  the testator only has access to free what he can take from his property, being the third  of the property he is allowed to bequeath, and the rest of the slave is not free because  the man's property has gone out of his hands. How can the rest of the slave which  belongs to other people be free when they did not initiate the setting free and did not  confirm it and they do not have the wala' established for them? Only the deceased  could do that. He was the one who freed him and the one for whom the wala' was  confirmed. That is not to be borne by another's property unless he bequeaths within  the third of his property what remains of a lave to be freed. That is a request against  his partners and inheritors and the partners must not refuse the slave that when it is  within the third of the dead man's property because there is no harm in that to the  inheritors.\"  Malik said, \"If a man frees a third of his slave while he is critically ill, he must  complete the emancipation so all of him is free from him, if it is within the third of  his property that he has access to, because he is not treated in the same way as a man  who frees a third of a slave after his death, because had the one who freed a third of  his slave after his death lived, he could have cancelled it and the slave's being set free  would be of no effect. The master who made the freeing of the third of the slave  irrevocable in his illness, would still have to free all of him if he lived. If he died, the  slave would be set free within the third of the bequest.

If the freed one was already muslim when he was freed,  the muslim children of the christian or jew had nothing of the wala' of a muslim slave  because the jew and the christian did not have the wala'.

    "text": "Malik related to me from Humayd ibn Qays al-Makki that a son of al-Mutawakkil  had a mukatab who died at Makka and left (enough to pay) the rest of his kitaba and  he owed some debts to people. He also left a daughter. The governor of Makka was  not certain about how to judge in the case, so he wrote to Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan  to ask him about it. Abd al-Malik wrote to him, \"Begin with the debts owed to  people, and then pay what remains of his kitaba. Then divide what remains of the  property between the daughter and the master.\"  Malik said, \"What is done among us is that the master of a slave does not have to  give his slave a kitaba if he asks for it. I have not heard of any of the Imams forcing a  man to give a kitaba to his slave. I heard that one of the people of knowledge, when  someone asked about that and mentioned that Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, said,  'Give them their kitaba, if you know some good in them' (Sura 24 ayat 33) recited  these two ayats, 'When you are free of the state of ihram, then hunt for game.' (Sura 5  ayat 3) 'When the prayer is finished, scatter in the land and seek Allah's favour.' \"  (Sura 62 ayat 10)  Malik commented, \"It is a way of doing things for which Allah, the Mighty, the  Majestic, has given permission to people, and it is not obligatory for them.\" Malik  said, \"I heard one of the people of knowledge say about the word of Allah, the  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 2 of 14 Blessed, the Exalted, 'Give them of the wealth which Allah has given you,' that it  meant that a man give his slave a kitaba and then reduce the end of his kitaba for him  by some specific amount.\"  Malik said, \"This is what I have heard from the people of knowledge and what I see  people doing here.\"  Malik said, \"I have heard that Abdullah ibn Umar gave one of his slaves his kitaba  for 35,000 dirhams, and then reduced the end of his kitaba by 5,000 dirhams.\"  Malik said, \"What is done among us is that when a master gives a mukatab his  kitaba, the mukatab's property goes with him but his children do not go with him  unless he stipulates that in his kitaba.\"  Yahya said, \"I heard Malik say that if a mukatab whose master had given him a  kitaba had a slave-girl who was pregnant by him, and neither he nor his master knew  that on the day he was given his kitaba, the child did not follow him because he was  not included in the kitaba. He belonged to the master. As for the slave-girl, she  belonged to the mukatab because she was his property.\"  Malik said that if a man and his wife's son (by another husband) inherited a mukatab  from the wife and the mukatab died before he had completed his kitaba, they divided  his inheritance between them according to the Book of Allah. If the slave paid his  kitaba and then died, his inheritance went to the son of the woman, and the husband  had nothing of his inheritance.  Malik said that if a mukatab gave his own slave a kitaba, the situation was looked at.  If he wanted to do his slave a favour and it was obvious by his making it easy for  him, that was not permitted. If he was giving him a kitaba from desire to find money  to pay off his own kitaba, that was permitted for him.  Malik said that if a man had intercourse with a mukataba of his and she became  pregnant by him, she had an option. If she liked she could be an umm walad. If she  wished, she could confirm her kitaba. If she did not conceive, she still had her kitaba.  Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things among us about a slave  who is owned by two men is that one of them does not give a kitaba for his share,  whether or not his companion gives him permission to do so, unless they both write  the kitaba together, because that alone would effect setting him free. If the slave were  to fulfil what he had agreed on to free half of himself, and then the one who had  given a kitaba for half of him was not obliged to complete his setting free, that would  be in opposition to the words of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and  grant him peace. 'If someone frees his share in a slave and has enough money to  cover the full price of the slave, justly evaluated for him, he must give his partners  their shares, so the slave is completely free . ' \"  Malik said, \"If he is not aware of that until the mukatab has met the terms or before  he has met them the owner who has written him the kitaba returns what he has taken  from the mukatab to him, and then he and his partner divide him according to their  original shares and the kitaba is invalid. He is the slave of both of them in his  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 3 of 14 original state.\"  Malik spoke about a mukatab who was owned by two men and one of them granted  him a delay in the payment of the right which he was owed, and the other refused to  defer it, and so the one who refused to defer the payment exacted his part of the due.  Malik said that if the mukatab then died and left property which did not complete his  kitaba, \"They divide it according to what they are still owed by him. Each of them  takes according to his share. If the mukatab leaves more than his kitaba, each of them  takes what remains to them of the kitaba, and what remains after that is divided  equally between them. If the mukatab is unable to pay his kitaba fully and the one  who did not allow him to defer his payment has exacted more than his associate did,  the slave is still divided equally between them, and he does not return to his  associates the excess of what he has exacted, because he only exacted his right with  the permission of his associate. If one of them remits what is owed to him and then  his associate exacts part of what he is owed by him and then the mukatab is unable to  pay, he belongs to both of them. And the one who has exacted something does not  return anything because he only demanded what he was owed. That is like the debt  of two men in one writing against one man. One of them grants him time to pay and  the other is greedy and exacts his due. Then the debtor goes bankrupt. The one who  exacted his due does not have to return any of what he took.\"  Section: Assuming the Responsibility in Kitaba"

    "text": "Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things among us is that when  slaves write their kitaba together in one kitaba, and some are responsible for others,  and they are not reduced anything by the death of one of the responsible ones, and  then one of them says, 'I can't do it,' and gives up, his companions can use him in  whatever work he can do and they help each other with that in their kitaba until they  are freed, if they are freed, or remain slaves if they remain slaves.\"  Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things among us is that when a  master gives a slave his kitaba, it is not permitted for the master to let anyone assume  the responsibility for the kitaba of his slave if the slave dies or is incapable. This is  not part of the sunna of the muslims. That is because when a man assumes  responsibility to the master of a mukatab for what the mukatab owes of his kitaba,  and then the master of the mukatab pursues that from the one who assumes the  responsibility, he takes his money falsely. It is not as if he is buying the mukatab, so  that what he gives is part of the price of something that is his, and neither is the  mukatab being freed so that the price established for him buys his inviolability as a  free man. If the mukatab is unable to meet the payments he reverts to his master and  is his slave. That is because kitaba is not a fixed debt which can be assumed by the  master of the mukatab. It is something which, when it is paid by the mukatab, sets  him free. If the mukatab dies and has a debt, his master is not one of the creditors for  what remains unpaid of the kitaba. The creditors have precedence over the master. If  the mukatab cannot meet the payments, and he owes debts to people, he reverts to  being a slave owned by his master and the debts to the people are the liability of the  mukatab. The creditors do not enter with the master into any share of the price of his  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 4 of 14 person.\"  Malik said, \"When people are written together in one kitaba and there is no kinship  between them by which they inherit from each other, and some of them are  responsible for others, then none of them are freed before the others until all the  kitaba has been paid. If one of them dies and leaves property and it is more than all  of what is against them, it pays all that is against them . The excess of the property  goes to the master, and none of those who have been written in the kitaba with the  deceased have any of the excess. The master's claims are overshadowed by their  claims for the portions which remain against them of the kitaba which can be  fulfilled from the property of the deceased, because the deceased had assumed their  responsibility and they must use his property to pay for their freedom. If the  deceased mukatab has a free child not born in kitaba and who was not written in the  kitaba, it does not inherit from him because the mukatab was not freed until he died.\"  Section: Severance in the Kitaba for an Agreed Price"
  },
  {
    "text": "Malik related to me that he heard that Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet, may  Allah bless him and grant him peace, made a settlement with her mukatab for an  agreed amount of gold and silver.  Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things among us in the case of a  mukatab who is shared by two partners, is that one of them cannot make a settlement  with him for an agreed price according to his portion without the consent of his  partner. That is because the slave and his property are owned by both of them, and so  one of them is not permitted to take any of the property except with the consent of  his partner. If one of them settled with the mukatab and his partner did not, and he  took the agreed price, and then the mukatab died while he had property or was  unable to pay, the one who settled would not have anything of the mukatab's  property and he could not return that for which he made settlement so that his right to  the slave's person would return to him. However, when someone settles with a  mukatab with the permission of his partner and then the mukatab is unable to pay, it  is preferable that the one who broke with him return what he has taken from the  mukatab for the severance and he can have back his portion of the mukatab. He can  do that. If the mukatab dies and leaves property, the partner who has kept hold of the  kitaba is paid in full the amount of the kitaba which remains to him against the  mukatab from the mukatab's property. Then what remains of property of the mukatab  is between the partner who broke with him and his partner, according to their shares  in the mukatab. If one of the partners breaks off with him and the other keeps the  kitaba, and the mukatab is unable to pay, it is said to the partner who settled with  him, 'If you wish to give your partner half of what you took so the slave is divided  between you, then do so. If you refuse, then all of the slave belongs to the one who  held on to possession of the slave.' \"  Malik spoke about a mukatab who was shared between two men and one of them  made a settlement with him with the permission of his partner. Then the one who  retained possession of the slave demanded the like of that for which his partner had  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 5 of 14 settled or more than that and the mukatab could not pay it. He said, \"The mukatab is  shared between them because the man has only demanded what is owed to him. If he  demands less than what the one who settled with him took and the mukatab can not  manage that, and the one who settled with him prefers to return to his partner half of  what he took so the slave is divided in halves between them, he can do that. If he  refuses then all of the slave belongs to the one who did not settle with him. If the  mukatab dies and leaves property, and the one who settled with him prefers to return  to his companion half of what he has taken so the inheritance is divided between  them, he can do that. If the one who has kept the kitaba takes the like of what the one  who has settled with him took, or more, the inheritance is between them according to  their shares in the slave because he is only taking his right.\"  Malik spoke about a mukatab who was shared between two men and one of them  made a settlement with him for half of what was due to him with the permission of  his partner, and then the one who retained possession of the slave took less than what  his partner settled with him for and the mukatab was unable to pay. He said, \"If the  one who made a settlement with the slave prefers to return half of what he was  awarded to his partner, the slave is divided between them. If he refuses to return it,  the one who retained possession has the portion of the share for which his partner  made a settlement with the mukatab.\"  Malik said, \"The explanation of that is that the slave is divided in two halves between  them. They write him a kitaba together and then one of them makes a settlement with  the mukatab for half his due with the permission of his partner. That is a fourth of all  the slave. Then the mukatab is unable to continue, so it is said to the one who settled  with him, 'If you wish, return to your partner half of what you were awarded and the  slave is divided equally between you.' If he refuses, the one who held to the kitaba  takes in full the fourth of his partner for which he made settlement with the mukatab.  He had half the slave, so that now gives him three-fourths of the slave. The one who  broke off has a fourth of the slave because he refused to return the equivalent of the  fourth share for which he settled.\"  Malik spoke about a mukatab whose master made a settlement with him and set him  free and what remained of his severance was written against him as debt, then the  mukatab died and people had debts against him. He said, \"His master does not share  with the creditors because of what he is owed from the severance. The creditors  begin first.\"  Malik said, \"A mukatab cannot break with his master when he owes debts to people.  He would be set free and have nothing because the people who hold the debts are  more entitled to his property than his master. That is not permitted for him.\"  Malik said, \"According to the way things are done among us, there is no harm if a  man gives a kitaba to his slave and settles with him for gold and reduces what he is  owed of the kitaba provided that only the gold is paid immediately. Whoever  disapproves of that does so because he puts it in the category of a debt which a man  has against another man for a set term. He gives him a reduction and he pays it  immediately. This is not like that debt. The breaking of the mukatab with his master  is dependent on his giving money to speed up the setting free. Inheritance, testimony  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 6 of 14 and the hudud are obliged for him and the inviolability of being set free is  established for him. He is not buying dirhams for dirhams or gold for gold. Rather it  is like a man who having said to his slave, 'Bring me such-and-such an amount of  dinars and you are free', then reduces that for him, saying, 'If you bring me less than  that, you are free.' That is not a fixed debt. Had it been a fixed debt, the master would  have shared with the creditors of the mukatab when he died or went bankrupt. His  claim on the property of the mukatab would join theirs.\"  Section: Injuries Caused by Mukatabs"

  {
    "text": "Malik said, \"The best of what I have heard about a mukatab who injures a man so  that blood-money must be paid, is that if the mukatab can pay the blood-money for  the injury with his kitaba, he does so, and it is against his kitaba. If he cannot do that,  and he cannot pay his kitaba because he must pay the blood-money of that injury  before the kitaba, and he cannot pay the blood-money of that injury, then his master  has an option. If he prefers to pay the blood-money of that injury, he does so and  keeps his slave and he becomes an owned slave. If he wishes to surrender the slave  to the injured, he surrenders him. The master does not have to do more than  surrender his slave.\"  Malik spoke about people who were in a general kitaba and one of them caused an  injury which entailed blood-money. He said, \"If any of them does an injury involving  blood-money, he and those who are with him in the kitaba are asked to pay all the  blood-money of that injury. If they pay, they are confirmed in their kitaba. If they do  not pay, and they are incapable then their master has an option. If he wishes, he can  pay all the blood-money of that injury and all the slaves revert to him. If he wishes,  he can surrender the one who did the injury alone and all the others revert to being  his slaves since they could not pay the blood-money of the injury which their  companion caused.\"  Malik said, \"The way of doing things about which there is no dispute among us, is  that when a mukatab is injured in some way which entails blood-money or one of the  mukatab's children who is written with him in the kitaba is injured, their  blood-money is the blood-money of slaves of their value, and what is appointed to  them as their blood-money is paid to the master who has the kitaba and he reckons  that for the mukatab at the end of his kitaba and there is a reduction for the  blood-money that the master has taken for the injury.\"  Malik said, \"The explanation of that is say, for example, he has written his kitaba for  three thousand dirhams and the blood-money taken by the master for his injury is  one thousand dirhams. When the mukatab has paid his master two thousand dirhams  he is free. If what remains of his kitaba is one thousand dirhams and the  blood-money for his injury is one thousand dirhams, he is free straightaway. If the  blood-money of the injury is more than what remains of the kitaba, the master of the  mukatab takes what remains of his kitaba and frees him. What remains after the  payment of the kitaba belongs to the mukatab. One must not pay the mukatab any of  the blood-money of his injury in case he might consume it and use it up. If he could  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 7 of 14 not pay his kitaba completely he would then return to his master one eyed, with a  hand cut off, or crippled in body. His master only wrote his kitaba against his  property and earnings, and he did not write his kitaba so that he would take the  blood-money for what happened to his child or to himself and use it up and consume  it. One pays the blood-money of injuries to a mukatab and his children who are born  in his kitaba, or their kitaba is written, to the master and he takes it into account for  him at the end of his kitaba.\"  Section: Selling Mukatabs"

    "text": "Malik said, \"The best of what is said about a man who buys the mukatab of a man is  that if the man wrote the slave's kitaba for dinars or dirhams, he does not sell him  unless it is for merchandise which is paid immediately and not deferred, because if it  is deferred, it would be a debt for a debt. A debt for a debt is forbidden.\"  He said, \"If the master gives a mukatab his kitaba for certain merchandise of camels,  cattle, sheep, or slaves, it is more correct that the buyer buy him for gold, silver, or  different goods than the ones his master wrote the kitaba for, and that must be paid  immediately, not deferred.\"  Malik said, \"The best of what I have heard about a mukatab when he is sold is that he  is more entitled to buy his kitaba than the one who buys him if he can pay his master  the price for which he was sold in cash. That is because his buying himself is his  freedom, and freedom has priority over what bequests accompany it. If one of those  who have written the kitaba for the mukatab sells his portion of him, so that a half, a  third, a fourth, or whatever share of the mukatab is sold, the mukatab does not have  the right of pre-emption in what is sold of him. That is because it is like the  severance of a partner, and a partner can only make a settlement for a partner of the  one who is mukatab with the permission of his partners because what is sold of him  does not give him complete rights as a free man and his property is barred from him,  and by buying part of himself, it is feared that he will become incapable of  completing payment because of what he had to spend. That is not like the mukatab  buying himself completely unless whoever has some of the kitaba remaining due to  him gives him permission. If they give him permission, he is more entitled to what is  sold of him.\"  Malik said, \"Selling one of the instalments of a mukatab is not halal. That is because  it Is an uncertain transaction. If the mukatab cannot pay it, what he owes is nullified.  If he dies or goes bankrupt and he owes debts to people, then the person who bought  his instalment does not take any of his portion with the creditors. The person who  buys one of the instalments of the mukatab is in the position of the master of the  mukatab. The master of the mukatab does not have a share with the creditors of the  mukatab for what he is owed of the kitaba of his slave. It is also like that with the  kharaj, (a set amount deducted daily from the slave against his earnings), which  accumulates for a master from the earnings of his slave. The creditors of his slave do  not allow him a share for what has accumulated for him from those deductions.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 8 of 14 Malik said, \"There is no harm in a mukatab paying off his kitaba with coin or  merchandise other than the merchandise for which he wrote his kitaba if it is  identical with it, on time (for the instalment) or delayed. \"  Malik said that if a mukatab died and left an umm walad and small children by her or  by someone else and they could not work and it was feared that they would be  unable to fulfil their kitaba, the umm walad of the father was sold if her price would  pay all the kitaba for them, whether or not she was their mother. They were paid for  and set free because their father did not forbid her sale if he feared that he would be  unable to complete his kitaba. If her price would not pay for them and neither she nor  they could work, they all reverted to being slaves of the master.  Malik said, \"What is done among us in the case of a person who buys the kitaba of a  mukatab, and then the mukatab dies before he has paid his kitaba, is that the person  who bought the kitaba inherits from him. If, rather than dying, the mukatab cannot  pay, the buyer has his person. If the mukatab pays his kitaba to the person who  bought him and he is freed, his wala' goes to the person who wrote the kitaba and the  person who bought his kitaba does not have any of it.\"  Section: The Labour of Mukatabs"

The mukatab, however, should not marry, travel, or leave the  land of his master without his permission, whether or not he stipulates that. That is  because the man may write a kitaba for his slave for 100 dinars and the slave may  have 1000 dinars or more than that. He goes off and marries a woman and pays her  bride-price which sweeps away his money and then he cannot pay. He reverts to his  master as a slave who has no property. Or else he may travel and his instalments fall  due while he is away. He cannot do that and kitaba is not to be based on that. That is  in the hand of his master. If he wishes, he gives him permission in that. If he wishes,  he refuses it.\"  Section: The Wala' of the Mukatab when he is Set Free"

If his master gives  his consent and the mukatab sets his slave free, his wala' goes to the mukatab . If the  mukatab then dies before he has been set free himself, the wala' of the freed slave  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 11 of 14 goes to the master of the mukatab. If the freed one dies before the mukatab has been  set free, the master of the mukatab inherits from him.\"  Malik said, \"It is like that also when a mukatab gives his slave a kitaba and his  mukatab is set free before he is himself. The wala' goes to the master of the mukatab  as long as he is not free. If this one who wrote the kitaba is set free, then the wala' of  his mukatab who was freed before him reverts to him. If the first mukatab dies before  he pays, or he cannot pay his kitaba and he has free children, they do not inherit the  wala' of their father's mukatab because the wala' has not been established for their  father and he does not have the wala' until he is free.\"  Malik spoke about a mukatab who was shared between two men and one of them  forewent what the mukatab owed him and the other insisted on his due. Then the  mukatab died and left property.  Malik said, \"The one who did not abandon any of what he was owed, is paid in full.  Then the property is divided between them both just as if a slave had died because  what the first one did was not setting him free. He only abandoned a debt that was  owed to him .\"  Malik said, \"One clarification of that is that when a man dies and leaves a mukatab  and he also leaves male and female children and one of the children frees his portion  of the mukatab, that does not establish any of the wala' for him. Had it been a true  setting free, the wala' would have been established for whichever men and women  freed him.\"  Malik said, \"Another clarification of that is that if one of them freed his portion and  then the mukatab could not pay, the value of what was left of the mukatab would be  altered because of the one who freed his portion. Had it been a true setting-free, his  estimated value would have been taken from the property of the one who set free  until he had been set completely free as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him  and grant him peace, said, 'Whoever frees his share in a slave and has money to  cover the full price of the slave, justly evaluated for him, gives his partners their  shares. If not, he frees of him what he frees.' \" (See Book 37 hadith 1).  He said, \"Another clarification of that is that part of the sunna of the muslims in  which there is no dispute, is that whoever frees his share of a mukatab, the mukatab  is not set fully free using his property. Had he been truly set free, the wala' would  have been his alone rather than his partners. Part of what will clarify that also is that  part of the sunna of the muslims is that the wala' belongs to whoever writes the  contract of kitaba. The women who inherit from the master of the mukatab do not  have any of the wala' of the mukatab. If they free any of their share, the wala'  belongs to the male children of the master of the mukatab or his male paternal  relations.\"  Section: What is Not Permitted in Freeing a Mukatab"

If that value is less than what remains against him of his kitaba, his freedom is taken  from the third that the deceased can bequeath. One does not look at the number of  dirhams which remain against him in his kitaba. That is because had he been killed,  his killer would not be in debt for other than his value on the day he killed him. Had  he been injured, the one who injured him would not be liable for other than the  blood-money of the injury on the day of his injury. One does not look at how much  he has paid of dinars and dirhams of the contract he has written because he is a slave  as long as any of his kitaba remains. If what remains in his kitaba is less than his  value, only whatever of his kitaba remains owing from him is taken into account in  the third of the property of the deceased. That is because the deceased left him what  remains of his kitaba and so it becomes a bequest which the deceased made.\"  Malik said, \"The illustration of that is that if the price of the mukatab is one thousand  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 13 of 14 dirhams, and only one hundred dirhams remain of his kitaba, his master leaves him  the one hundred dirhams which complete it for him. It is taken into account in the  third of his master and by it he becomes free.\"  Malik said that if a man wrote his slave a kitaba at his death, the value of the slave  was estimated. If there was enough to cover the price of the slave in one third of his  property, that was permitted for him.  Malik said, \"The illustration of that is that the price of the slave is one thousand  dinars. His master writes him a kitaba for two hundred dinars at his death. The third  of the property of his master is one thousand dinars, so that is permitted for him. It is  only a bequest which he makes from one third of his property. If the master has left  bequests to people, and there is no surplus in the third after the value of the mukatab,  one begins with the mukatab because the kitaba is setting free, and setting free has  priority over bequests. When those bequests are paid from the kitaba of the mukatab,  they follow it. The heirs of the testator have a choice. If they want to give the people  with bequests all their bequests and the kitaba of the mukatab is theirs, they have  that. If they refuse and hand over the mukatab and what he owes to the people with  bequests they can do that, because the third commences with the mukatab and  because all the bequests which he makes are as one.\"  If the heirs then say, \"What our fellow bequeathed was more than one third of his  property and he has taken what was not his,\" Malik said, \"His heirs choose. It is said  to them, 'Your companion has made the bequests you know about and if you would  like to give them to those who are to receive them according to the deceased's  bequests, then do so. If not, hand over to the people with bequests one third of the  total property of the deceased.' \"  Malik continued, \"If the heirs surrender the mukatab to the people with bequests, the  people with bequests have what he owes of his kitaba. If the mukatab pays what he  owes of his kitaba, they take that in their bequests according to their shares. If the  mukatab cannot pay, he is a slave of the people with bequests and does not return to  the heirs because they gave him up when they made their choice, and because when  he was surrendered to the people with bequests, they were liable. If he died, they  would not have anything against the heirs. If the mukatab dies before he pays his  kitaba and he leaves property which is more than what he owes, his property goes to  the people with bequests. If the mukatab pays what he owes, he is free and his wala'  returns to the paternal relations of the one who wrote the kitaba for him.\"  Malik spoke about a mukatab who owed his master ten thousand dirhams in his  kitaba, and when he died he remitted one thousand dirhams from it. He said, \"The  mukatab is valued and his value is taken into consideration. If his value is one  thousand dirhams and the reduction is a tenth of the kitaba, that portion of the slave's  price is one hundred dirhams. It is a tenth of the price. A tenth of the kitaba is  therefore reduced for him. That is converted to a tenth of the price in cash. That is as  if he had had all of what he owed reduced for him. Had he done that, only the value  of the slave - one thousand dirhams - would have been taken into account in the third  of the property of the deceased. If that which he had remitted is half of the kitaba,  half the price is taken into account in the third of the property of the deceased. If it is  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 39: The Mukatab  Page 14 of 14 more or less than that, it is according to this reckoning.\"  Malik said, \"When a man reduces the kitaba of his mukatab by one thousand dirhams  at his death from a kitaba of ten thousand dirhams, and he does not stipulate whether  it is from the beginning or the end of his kitaba, each instalment is reduced for him  by one tenth.\"  Malik said, \"If a man remits one thousand dirhams from his mukatab at his death  from the beginning or end of his kitaba, and the original basis of the kitaba is three  thousand dirhams, the mukatab's cash value is estimated. Then that value is divided.  That thousand which is from the beginning of the kitaba is converted into its portion  of the price according to its proximity to the term and its precedence and then the  thousand which follows the first thousand is according to its precedence also until it  comes to its end, and every thousand is paid according to its place in advancing and  deferring the term because what is deferred of that is less in respect of its price. Then  it is placed in the third of the deceased according to whatever of the price befalls that  thousand according to the difference in preference of that, whether it is more or less,  then it is according to this reckoning.\"  Malik spoke about a man who willed a man a fourth of a mukatab or freed a fourth,  and then the man died and the mukatab died and left a lot of property, more than he  owed. He said, \"The heirs of the first master and the one who was willed a fourth of  the mukatab are given what they are still owed by the mukatab. Then they divide  what is left over, and the one willed a fourth has a third of what is left after the kitaba  is paid. The heirs of his master gets two-thirds. That is because the mukatab is a slave  as long as any of his kitaba remains to be paid. He is inherited from by the  possession of his person.\"  Malik said about a mukatab whose master freed him at death, \"If the third of the  deceased will not cover him, he is freed from it according to what the third will cover  and his kitaba is decreased according to that. If the mukatab owed five thousand  dirhams and his value is two thousand dirhams cash, and the third of the deceased is  one thousand dirhams, half of him is freed and half of the kitaba has been reduced  for him.\" Malik said about a man who said in his will, \"My slave so-and-so is free  and write a kitaba for so-and-so\", that the setting free had priority over the kitaba.

A third of the blood-money is  against the third of him which was set free, and two-thirds are against the two-thirds  which the heirs have. If they wish, they surrender what they have of him to the party  with the injury, and if they wish, they give the injured person two-thirds of the  blood-money and keep their portion of the slave. That is because that injury is a  criminal action by the slave and it is not a debt against the master by which whatever  setting free and tadbir the master had done would be abrogated. If there were a debt  to people held against the master of the slave, as well as the criminal action of the  slave, part of the mudabbar would be sold in proportion to the blood-money of the  injury and according to the debt. Then one would begin with the blood-money which  was for the criminal action of the slave and it would be paid from the price of the  slave. Then the debt of his master would be paid, and then one would look at what  remained after that of the slave. His third would b be set free, and two-thirds of him  would belong to the heirs. That is because the criminal action of the slave is more  important than the debt of his master. That is because, if the man dies and leaves a  mudabbar slave whose value is one hundred and fifty dinars, and the slave strikes a  free man on the head with a blow that lays open the skull, and the blood-money is  fifty dinars, and the master of the slave has a debt of fifty dinars, one begins with the  fifty dinars which are the blood-money of the head wound, and it is paid from the  price of the slave. Then the debt of the master is paid. Then one looks at what  remains of the slave, and a third of him is set free and two-thirds of him remain for  the heirs. The blood-money is more pressing against his person than the debt of his  master. The debt of his master is more pressing than the tadbir which is a bequest  from the third of the property of the deceased. None of the tadbir is permitted while  the master of the mudabbar has a debt which is not paid. It is a bequest. That is  because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, said, 'After any bequest that is made or any  debt.' \" (Sura 4 ayat 10)  Malik said, \"If there is enough in the third property that the deceased can bequeath to  free all the mudabbar, he is freed and the blood-money due from his criminal action  is held as a debt against him which follows him after he is set free even if that  blood-money is the full blood-money.

That is because the grave is a place of custody for what is in it just as houses  are a place of custody for what is in them. \"  Malik added, \"Cutting off the hand is not obliged for him until he takes it out of the  grave.\"  Section: Things for Which the Hand is Not Cut Off"

The owner of the palm went out looking for the palm and found  it. He asked for help against the slave from Marwan ibn al-Hakam. Marwan jailed  the slave and wanted to cut off his hand. The master of the slave rushed off to Rafi  ibn Khadij and asked him about it. Rafi informed him that he heard the Messenger of  Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, \"The hand is not cut off for  fruit or palm pith.\" The man said, \"Marwan ibn al-Hakam has taken a slave of mine  and wants to cut off his hand. I would like you to go with me to him so you can tell  him what you heard from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant  him peace.\" So, Rafi went with him to Marwan ibn al-Hakam. He said, \"Did you  arrest a slave for this?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"What will you do with him?\" He  said, \"I want to cut off his hand.\" Rafi said to him, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah,  may Allah bless him and grant him peace, say, 'The hand is not cut off for dates or  palm pith.'

He does  not have his hand cut off for what he has denied.\"  Malik said, \"The generally agreed-on way of dealing among us, with the thief who is  found in a house and has gathered up goods and has not taken them out, is that his  hand is not cut off. That is like the man who places wine before him to drink it and  does not do it. The hadd is not imposed on him.

Ibn Shihab said, \"If the healthy person  wants to take retaliation from him, he can have his retaliation. If he prefers, he has  blood-money of one thousand dinars, twelve thousand dirhams.\"  Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that full blood-money was payable for  both of a pair of anything in a man that occurred in pairs, and the tongue had full  blood-money. The ears, when their hearing departed, had full blood-money, whether  or not they were cut off, and a man's penis had full blood-money and the testicles had  full blood-money.

Then the  blood-money is increased by one half of the blood-money of the head wound in  which the skin was bared so that seventy five dinars are payable for it.  Malik said, \"What is done in our community is that the head wound with splinters  has fifteen camels.\" He explained, \"The head wound with splinters is that from which  pieces of bone fly off and which does not reach the brain. It can be in the head or the  face.\"  Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things in our community, is that  there is no retaliation for a wound to the brain or a belly wound, and Ibn Shihab has  said, 'There is no retaliation for a wound to the brain.' \"  Malik explained, \"The wound to the brain is what pierces the bones to the brain.

The imam uses ijtihad in  it, and there is no generally agreed on way of doing things in our community about  it.\"  Malik said, \"What is done in our community about the wound to the brain and the  wound which splinters the bone, and the wound that bares the bone is that they apply  only to the head and face.

He  said, \"Do you make front teeth like molars?\" Abdullah ibn Abbas said, \"It is enough  that you take the fingers as the example for that, their blood-moneys being all the  same.\"  Yahya related to me from Malik from Hisham ibn Urwa that his father made all the  teeth the same in the blood-money and did not prefer any kind over others.  Malik said, \"What is done in our community is that the front teeth, molars, and  eye-teeth have the same blood-money.

The molar is  one of the teeth and he did not prefer any kind over the others.\"  Section: The Blood-Money for Injuries to Slaves  Book 43, Number 43.14.8a:  Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that Said ibn al-Musayyab and  Sulayman ibn Yasar said, \"The head wound of the slave in which the bone is bared is  a twentieth of his price.\"  Malik related to me that he had heard that Marwan ibn al-Hakam gave a decision  about a slave who was injured that the person who injured him had to pay what he  had diminished of the value of the slave.  Malik said, \"What is done in our community is that for the head wound of a slave  that bares the bone, there is a twentieth of his price. The head wound which splinters  the bone is three twentieths of his price. Both the wound to the brain and the belly  wound are a third of his price. Besides these four, any other types of injury that  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 43: Blood-Money  Page 9 of 16 decrease the price of the slave are considered after the slave is better and well, and  one sees what the value of the slave is after his injury and what his value whole was  before he had the injury. Then the one who injured him pays the difference between  the two values.\"  Section: The Blood-Money of the People of Protection (Dhimma)  Book 43, Number 43.15.8b:  Yahya related to me from Malik that he heard that Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz gave a  decision that when a jew or christian was killed, his blood-money was half the  blood-money of a free muslim.  Malik said, \"What is done in our community, is that a muslim is not killed for a kafir  unless the muslim kills him by deceit. Then he is killed for it.\"  Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said that Sulayman ibn Yasar said,  \"The blood-money of a magian is eight hundred dirhams.\"  Malik said, \"This is what is done in our community.\"  Malik said, \"The blood-monies of the jew, christian, and magian in their injuries, is  according to the injury of the muslims in their blood-moneys. The head wound is a  twentieth of his full blood-money. The wound that opens the head is a third of his  blood-money. The belly-wound is a third of his blood-money. All their injuries are  according to this calculation.\"  Section: Blood-Money that has to be Paid as an Individual  Book 43, Number 43.16.8c:  Yahya related to me from Malik from Hisham ibn Urwa that his father said, \"The  tribe is not obliged to pay blood-money for intentional murder. They pay  blood-money for accidental killing.\"  Yahya related to me from Malik that Ibn Shihab said, \"The precedent of the sunna is  that the tribe are not liable for any blood-money of an intentional killing unless they  wish that.\"  Yahya related to me from Malik from Yahya ibn Said the same as that.  Malik said that Ibn Shihab said, \"The precedent of the sunna in the intentional  murder is that when the relatives of the murdered person relinquish retaliation, the  blood-money is owed by the murderer from his own property unless the tribe helps  him with it willingly.\"  Malik said, \"What is done in our community is that the blood-money is not obliged  against the tribe until it has reached a third of the full amount and upwards. Whatever  reaches a third is against the tribe, and whatever is below a third, is against the  property of the one who did the injury.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 43: Blood-Money  Page 10 of 16 Malik said, \"The way of doing things about which there is no dispute among us, in  the case of someone who has the blood-money accepted from him in intentional  murder or in any injury in which there is retaliation, is that that blood-money is not  due from the tribe unless they wish it. The blood-money for that is from the property  of the murderer or the injurer if he has property. If he does not have any property, it  is a debt against him, and none of it is owed by the tribe unless they wish.\"  Malik said, \"The tribe does not pay blood-money to anyone who injures himself,  intentionally or accidentally. This is the opinion of the people of fiqh in our  community. I have not heard that anyone has made the tribe liable for any  blood-money incurred by intentional acts. Part of what is well-known of that is that  Allah, the Blessed, and the Exalted, said in His Book, 'Whoever has something  pardoned him by his brother, should follow it with what is accepted and pay it with  good will' (Sura 2 ayat 178) The commentary on that - in our view - and Allah knows  best, is that whoever gives his brother something of the blood-money, should follow  it with what is accepted and pay him with good will.\"  Malik spoke about a child who had no property and a woman who had no property.  He said, \"When one of them causes an injury below a third of the blood-money, it is  taken on behalf of the child and woman from their personal property, if they have  property from which it may be taken. If not, the injury which each of them has  caused is a debt against them. The tribe does not have to pay any of it and the father  of a child is not liable for the blood-money of an injury caused by the child and he is  not responsible for it.\"  Malik said, \"The way of doing things in our community about which there is no  dispute, is that when a slave is killed, the value for him is that of the day on which he  was killed. The tribe of the murderer is not liable for any of the value of the slave,  great or small. That is the responsibility of the one who struck him from his own  personal property as far as it covers. If the value of the slave is the blood-money or  more, that is against him in his property. That is because the slave is a certain type of  goods.\"  Section: Inheritance of Blood-Money and Dealing Harshly in Taking It"

The well is of no account and no  compensation is due for it. The mine is of no account and no compensation is due for  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 43: Blood-Money  Page 12 of 16 it and a fifth is due for buried treasures.\" (Al-kanz: see Book 17).  Malik said, \"Everyone leading an animal by the halter, driving it, and riding it is  responsible for what the animal strikes unless the animal kicks out without anything  being done to it to make it kick out. Umar ibn al-Khattab imposed the blood-money  on a person who was exercising his horse.\"  Malik said, \"It is more fitting that a person leading an animal by the halter, driving it,  or riding it incur a loss than a person who is exercising his horse.\" (See hadith 4 of  this book).  Malik said, \"What is done in our community about a person who digs a well on a  road or ties up an animal or does the like of that on a road used by muslims, is that  since what he has done is included in that which he is not permitted to do in such a  place, he is liable for whatever injury or other thing arises from that action. The  blood-money of that which is less than a third of the full blood-money is owed from  his own personal property. Whatever reaches a third or more, is owed by his tribe.  Any such things that he does which he is permitted to do on the muslims' road are  something for which he has no liability or loss. Part of that is a hole which a man  digs to collect rain, and the beast from which the man alights for some need and  leaves standing on the road. There is no penalty against anyone for this.\"  Malik spoke about a man who went down a well, and another man followed behind  him, and the lower one pulled the higher one and they fell into the well and both died  He said, \"The tribe of the one who pulled him in is responsible for the blood-money.\"  Malik spoke about a child whom a man ordered to go down into a well or to climb a  palm tree and he died as a result. He said, \"The one who ordered him is liable for  whatever befalls him, be it death or something else.\"  Malik said, \"The way of doing things in our community about which there is no  dispute is that women and children are not obliged to pay blood-money together with  the tribe in the blood-moneys which the tribe must pay. The blood-money is only  obligatory for a man who has reached puberty.\"  Malik said that the tribe could bind themselves to the blood-money of mawali if they  wished. If they refused, they were people of the diwan or were cut off from their  people. In the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him  peace, people paid the blood-money to each other as well as in the time of Abu Bakr  as-Siddiq before there was a diwan. The diwan was in the time of Umar ibn  al-Khattab. No one other than one's people and the ones holding the wala' paid  blood-money for one because the wala' was not transferable and because the Prophet,  may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"The wala' belongs to the one who  sets free.\"  Malik said, \"The wala' is an established relationship.\"  Malik said, \"What is done in our community about animals that are injured is that the  person who causes the injury pays whatever of their value has been diminished.\"  Malik said about a man condemned to death and one of the other hudud befell him,  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 43: Blood-Money  Page 13 of 16 \"He is not punished for it. That is because the killing overrides all of that, except for  slander.

I think that the  condemned man is flogged with the hadd before he is killed, and then he is killed. I  do not think that any retaliation is inflicted on him for any injury except killing  because killing overrides all of that.\"  Malik said, \"What is done in our community is that when a murdered person is found  among the main body of a people in a village or other place, the house or place of the  nearest people to him is not responsible. That is because the murdered person can be  slain and then cast at the door of some people to shame them by it.

MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 43: Blood-Money  Page 14 of 16 Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things in our community about  which there is no dispute is that when a man strikes another man with a stick or hits  him with a rock or intentionally strikes him causing his death, that is an intentional  injury and there is retaliation for it.\"  Malik said, \"Intentional murder with us is that a man intentionally goes to a man and  strikes him until his life goes. Part of intentional injury also is that a man strikes a  man in a quarrel between them. He leaves him while he is alive, and he bleeds to  death and so dies. There is retaliation for that.\"  Malik said, \"What is done in our community is that a group of free men are killed for  the intentional murder of one free man, and a group of women for one woman, and a  group of slaves for one slave.\"  Section: Retaliation in Killing  Book 43, Number 43.21.15a:  Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that Marwan ibn al-Hakam wrote  to Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan to mention to him that a drunkard was brought to him  who had killed a man. Muawiya wrote to him to kill him in retaliation for the dead  man.  Yahya said that Malik said, \"The best of what I have heard on the interpretation of  this ayat, the word of Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, 'The free man for the free man  and the slave for the slave - these are men and the woman for the woman,' (Sura 2  ayat 178) is that retaliation is between women as it is between men. The free woman  is killed for the free woman as the free man is killed for the free man. The slave-girl  is slain for the slave-girl as the slave is slain for the slave. Retaliation is between  women as it is between men. That is because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, said in  His Book, 'We have written for them in it that it is a life for a life and an eye for an  eye, a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds  there is retaliation.' (Sura 5 ayat 48) Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, mentioned that it  is a life for a life. It is the life of a free woman for the life of a free man, and her  injury for his injury.\"  Malik said about a man who held a man fast for another man to hit, and he died on  the spot, \"If he held him and he thought that he meant to kill him, the two of them are  both killed for him. If he held him and he thought that he meant to beat him as  people sometimes do, and he did not think that he meant to kill him, the murderer is  slain and the one who held him is punished with a very severe punishment and jailed  for a year. There is no killing against him.\"  Malik said about a man who murdered a man intentionally or gouged out his eye  intentionally, and then was slain or had his eye gouged out himself before retaliation  was inflicted on him, \"There is no blood-money nor retaliation against him. The right  of the one who was killed or had his eye gouged out goes when the thing which he is  claiming as retaliation goes. It is the same with a man who murders another man  intentionally and then the murderer dies. When the murderer dies, the one seeking  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 43: Blood-Money  Page 15 of 16 blood-revenge has nothing of blood-money or anything else. That is by the word of  Allah, the Blessed the Exalted, 'Retaliation is written for you in killing. The free man  for the free man and the slave for the slave.' \"  Malik said, \"He only has retaliation against the one who killed him. If the man who  murdered him dies, he has no retaliation or blood-money.\"  Malik said, \"There is no retaliation held against a free man by a slave for any injury.  The slave is killed for the free man when he intentionally murders him. The free man  is not slain for the slave, even if he murders him intentionally. It is the best of what I  have heard.\"  Section: Pardoning Murder  Book 43, Number 43.22.15b:  Yahya related to me from Malik that he saw whomever he was satisfied with among  the people of knowledge say about a man who willed that his murderer be pardoned  when he murdered him intentionally, \"That is permitted for him. He is more entitled  to the man's blood than any of his relatives after him.\"  Malik said about a man who pardoned murder, after he had claimed his right and it  was obliged for him, \"There is no blood-money against the murderer unless the one  who pardons him stipulates that when he pardons him.\"  Malik said about the murderer when he was pardoned, \"He is flogged one hundred  lashes and jailed for a year.\"  Malik said, \"When a man murders intentionally and there is a clear proof of that, and  the murdered man has sons and daughters and the sons pardon and the daughters  refuse to pardon, the pardon of the sons is permitted in opposition to the daughters  and there is no authority for the daughters with the sons in demanding blood and  pardoning.\"  Section: Retaliation in Injury  Book 43, Number 43.23.15c:  Yahya said that Malik said, \"The generally agreed on way of doing things in our  community is that retaliation is taken from someone who breaks someone's hand or  foot intentionally and not blood-money.\"  Malik said, \"Retaliation is not inflicted on anyone until the wound of the injured  party has healed. Then retaliation is inflicted on him. If the wound of the person on  whom the retaliation has been inflicted is like the first person's wound when it heals,  it is retaliation.

The bodily injury is also like that.\"  Malik said, \"When a man intentionally goes to his wife and gouges out her eye or  breaks her hand or cuts off her finger or such like, and does it intentionally,  retaliation is inflicted on him. As for a man who strikes his wife with a rope or a  whip and hits what he did not mean to hit or does what he did not intend to do, he  pays blood-money for what he has struck according to this principle, and retaliation  is not inflicted on him.\"  Yahya related to me from Malik that he had heard that Abu Bakr ibn Muhammd ibn  Amr ibn Hazm took retaliation for the breaking of a leg.

The oath for revenge is only obligatory in two situations.  Either the slain person says, 'My blood is against so-and-so,' or the relatives entitled  to the blood bring a partial proof of it that is not irrefutable against the one who is the  object of the blood-claim. This obliges taking an oath on the part of those who claim  the blood against those who are the object of the blood-claim. With us, swearing is  only obliged in these two situations.\"  Malik said, \"That is the sunna in which there is no dispute with us and which is still  the behaviour of the people. The people who claim blood begin the swearings,  whether it is an intentional killing or an accident.\"  Malik said, \"The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,  began with Banu Harith in the case of the killing of their kinsman murdered at  Khaybar.\"  Malik said, \"If those who make the claim swear, they deserve the blood of their  kinsman and whoever they swear against is slain. Only one man can be killed in the  qasama. Two cannot be killed in it. Fifty men from the blood-relatives must swear  fifty oaths. If their number is less or some of them draw back, they can repeat their  oaths, unless one of the relatives of the murdered man who deserves blood and who  is permitted to pardon it, draws back. If one of these draws back, there is no way to  revenge.\"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"The oaths can be made by those of them who remain if  one of them draws back who is not permitted to pardon. If one of the blood-relatives  draws back who is permitted to pardon, even if he is only one, more oaths can not be  made after that by the blood-relatives. If that occurs, the oaths can be on behalf of the  one against whom the claim is made. So fifty of the men of his people swear fifty  oaths. If there are not fifty men, more oaths can be made by those of them who  already swore. If there is only the defendant, he swears fifty oaths and is acquitted.\"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"One distinguishes between swearing for blood and oaths  for one's rights. When a man has a money-claim against another man, he seeks to  verify his due. When a man wants to kill another man, he does not kill him in the  midst of people. He keeps to a place away from people. Had there only been  swearing in cases where there is a clear proof and had one acted in it as one acts  about one's rights (i.e. needing witnesses), the right of blood retribution would have  been lost and people would have been swift to take advantage of it when they learned  of the decision on it. However, the relatives of the murdered man were allowed to  initiate swearing so that people might restrain themselves from blood and the  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 44: The Oath of Qasama  Page 3 of 5 murderer might beware lest he was put into a situation like that (i.e. qasama) by the  statement of the murdered man.' \"  Yahya said, \"Malik said about a people of whom a certain number are suspected of  murder and the relatives of the murdered man ask them to take oaths and they are  numerous, so they ask that each man swears fifty oaths on his own behalf. The oaths  are not divided out between them according to their number and they are not  acquitted unless each man among them swears fifty oaths on his own behalf.\"  Malik said, \"This is the best I have heard about the matter.\"  He said, \"Swearing goes to the paternal relatives of the slain. They are the  blood-relatives who swear against the killer and by whose swearing he is killed.\"  Section: Blood-Relatives Who are Permitted to Swear in the Intentional Act  Book 44, Number 44.2.2a:  Yahya said that Malik said, \"The way of doing things in our community about which  there is no dispute is that women do not swear in the swearing for the intentional act.  If the murdered man only has female relatives, the women have no right to swear for  blood and no pardon in murder.\"  Yahya said that Malik said about a man who is murdered, \"If the paternal relatives of  the murdered man or his mawali say, 'We swear and we demand our companion's  blood,' that is their right.\"  Malik said, \"If the women want to pardon him, they cannot do that. The paternal  relatives and mawali are entitled to do that more than them because they are the ones  who demand blood and swear for it.\"  Malik said, \"If the paternal relatives or mawali pardon after they demand blood and  the women refuse and say, 'We will not abandon our right against the murderer of  our companion,' the women are more entitled to that because whoever takes  retaliation is more entitled than the one who leaves it among the women and paternal  relatives when the murder is established and killing obliged.\"  Malik said, \"At least two claimants must swear in murder. The oaths are repeated by  them until they swear fifty oaths, then they have the right to blood. That is how  things are done in our community.\"  Malik said, \"When people beat a man and he dies in their hands, they are all slain for  him. If he dies after their beating, there is swearing. If there is swearing, it is only  against one man and only he is slain. We have never known the swearing to be  against more than one man.\"  Malik spoke about a slave who had his hand or foot broken and then the break  mended . He said, \"The one who injured him is not obliged to pay anything. If that  break causes him loss or scar, the one who injured him must pay according to what  he diminished of the value of the slave.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 44: The Oath of Qasama  Page 4 of 5 Malik said, \"What is done in our community about retaliation between slaves is that  it is like retaliation between freemen. The life of the slave-girl for the life of the  slave, and her injury for his injury. When a slave intentionally kills a slave, the  master of the murdered slave has a choice. If he wishes, he kills him, and if he  wishes, he takes the blood-money. If he takes the blood-money, he takes the value of  his slave. If the owner of the slave who killed wishes to give the value of the  murdered slave, he does it. If he wishes, he surrenders his slave. If he surrenders him,  he is not obliged to do anything other than that. When the owner of the murdered  slave takes the slave who murdered and is satisifed with him, he must not kill him.  All retaliations between slaves for cutting off of the hand and foot and such things  are dealt with in the same way as in the murder.\"  Malik said about a muslim slave who injures a jew or christian, \"If the master of the  slave wishes to pay blood-money for him according to the injury, he does it. Or else  he surrenders him and he is sold, and the jew or christian is given the blood-money of  the injury or all the price of the slave if the blood-money is greater than his price.  The jew or christian is not given a muslim slave.\"  Section: Swearing in Manslaughter  Book 44, Number 44.3.2b:  Yahya said that Malik said, \"The way of doing things in our community about Yahya  said that Malik said, \"The procedure in swearing in manslaughter is that those who  claim blood swear and it becomes due by their swearing. They swear fifty oaths, and  there is blood-money for them according to the division of their inheritances. If it is  not possible to divide up the oaths which they swear between them evenly, one looks  to the one who has most of those oaths against him, and that oath is obliged against  him.\"  Malik said, \"If the slain man only has female heirs, they swear and take the  blood-money. If he only has one male heir, he swears fifty oaths and takes the  blood-money. That is only in the accidental killing, not in the intentional one.\"  Section: Inheritance in Cases of Qasama  Book 44, Number 44.4.2c:  Yahya said that Malik said, \"When the relatives of the deceased accept the  blood-money then it is inherited according to the Book of Allah. Daughters of the  dead man inherit and so do sisters, and whichever women would inherit from him  ordinarily.  If the women do not take all his inheritance, then what remains goes to the agnatic  relations who most deserve to inherit from him in conjunction with the women.\"  Malik said, \"When one of the heirs of a man killed by mistake attempts to take his  due from the blood-money while his companions are absent, he may not do that, and  he has no right to any of the blood-money, however large or small, unless the qasama  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 44: The Oath of Qasama  Page 5 of 5 has been completed by him. If he swears fifty oaths then he has the right to his  portion of the blood-money. That is because the blood-money is not established as  due without there being fifty oaths, and the blood-money is not established as due  unless the responsibility for the blood is established. If any one of the heirs comes  after that he swears a number of the oaths commensurate with his fraction of the  inheritance and takes his right until all the heirs exact their complete right. If a  maternal uncle comes he has one sixth and must swear one sixth of the fifty oaths. So  whoever swears may take his due from the blood-money and whoever abstains  annuls his right. If one of the heirs is absent or is a child who has not reached  puberty, those who are present swear fifty oaths and if the one who was absent  comes after that or the child reaches puberty, they swear. and they swear according  to their due of the blood-money and according to their shares of inheritance from it.\"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"This is the best I have heard on the matter.\"  Section: Swearing for Blood-Revenge in Cases Involving Slaves  Book 44, Number 44.5.2d:  Yahya said that Malik said, \"What is done in our community about slaves is that  when a slave is struck intentionally or accidentally and the master brings a witness,  he swears with his witness one oath and then he has the value of the slave. There is  no swearing for revenge in slaves, accidentally or intentionally, and I have not heard  any of the people of knowledge say that there was.\"  Malik said, \"If a slave is killed intentionally or accidentally, the master of the slave  who is slain has no swearing or oath. The master cannot demand his right except  with a fair proof or a witness if he swears with one witness.\"  Yahya said that Malik said, \"This is the best of what I have heard on the matter.''

If their livestock are destroyed, they will return to  palm-trees and agriculture. If the livestock of the one with a small herd of camels and  the one with a small herd of sheep are destroyed, he will bring his children to me  crying, 'Amir al-muminin! Amir al-Muminin!' Shall I neglect them? Water and  pasturage are of less value to me than gold and silver. By Allah, they think that I  have wronged them. This is their land and their water. They fought for it in the  jahiliyya and became muslims on it in Islam. By He in whose hand my self is! Were  it not for the mounts which I give to be ridden in the way of Allah, I would not have  turned a span of their land into hima.\"  MALIK'S MUWATTA, BOOK 61: The Names of the Pr... Page 1 of 1"

    "text": "Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani (rahmatullahi alaihi) \n(310/922 - 386/996) \nThe author of Ar-Risala \nTranslated by Aisha Bewley \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad 'Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) was one of the people North Africa. Shaikh Abu Zayd's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) name was 'Abdu'r-Rahman according to \nShaikh ibn Makula (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Qadi ibn al-\nHadhdha' (rahmatullahi alaihi). He was from the tribe of Nifza \nand lived in Qayrawan. \n \nHis (rahmatullahi alaihi) position in knowledge  \n \nHe was the Imam of the Malikis in his time and their model. He \nhad a comprehensive grasp of the school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and explained his statements. He had \nextensive knowledge and a prodigious memory and transmission. \nHis books are ample testimony of that. His writing was fluent, \nclarifying and defining what he said. He defended the school of \nImam Malik and established evidence in its support. He knew how \nto refute the people of sects. In addition to his writing, he was very \nrighteous, scrupulousness and chastity. He obtained leadership in \nthe deen and this world. and people from all regions traveled to \nvisit him. His companions were noble and many people took \nknowledge from him. He composed a summary of the school and \nundertook to spread it and defend it. His books filled the lands \nand were well-known to most of its people.  \n \nShaikh ash-Shirazi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He was known as \n'little Malik'. Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentioned him and said that he was a reliable Imam in his \nperception and transmission. Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn \n'Abdullah al-Qattan (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, 'I did not imitate \nShaikh Abu Muhammad ibn Abi Zayd until I saw Shaikh As-\nSaba'i imitated him.'\"  \n \nShaikh Abu Bakr ibn at-Tayyib (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned \nhim in his book, and esteemed his  value and merit. The same was \ntrue among other scholars in the east. Shaikh ibn Mujahid al-\nBaghdadi (rahmatullahi alaihi) and other Baghadadi companions \nof him asked him for an ijaza.  \n \nShaikh Abu 'Abdullah al-Mayruqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He \npossessed knowledge, scrupulousness, excellence and intellect. He \nis too famous to need to be mentioned.\"  \n \nShaikh ad-Da'udi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He was quick to \nfollow the truth. He studied fiqh with the fuqaha' of his land and \nlistened to its Shaikhs. He relied on Shaikh Abu Bakr ibn al-\nLubbad (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Abu'l-Fadl al-Mumsi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and also studied with Shaikh Muhammad \nibn Masrur al-'Assal (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abdullah ibn \nMasrur ibn al-Hajjam (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Qattan \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Ibyyani (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh Ziyad ibn Musa (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Sa'dun al-\nKhawlani (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abu'l-'Arab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh Abu Ahmad ibn Abi Sa‟id (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi), the client of Shaikh Ibn Abi \nSulayman (rahmatullahi alaihi), and others. He traveled and went \non hajj and listened to Shaikh ibn al-A'rabi (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Mundhir (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh Abu 'Ali ibn Abi Hilal (rahmatullahi alaihi), and \nShaikh Ahmad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthe Qadi. He also listened to Shaikh Al-Hasan ibn Badr \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nShaikh \nMuhammad \nibn \nAl-Fath \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Hasan ibn Nasr as-Susi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Darras ibn Isma'il (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh 'Uthman ibn Sa‟id al-Gharabuli (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh Habib ibn Abi Habib al-Jazari (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and others. Shaikh ibn Sha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh al-Aburri (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh al-Marwazi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) asked him for an ijaza. Many people listened \nto him and a lot of people learned fiqh with him. His adherents in \nQayrawan included Shaikh Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Abu'l-Qasim al-Baradha'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh al-Lubaydi (rahmatullahi alaihi), the sons of \nShaikh al-Ajdabi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abu 'Abdullah al-\nKhawwas (rahmatullahi alaihi), and Shaikh Abu Muhammad al-\nMakki al-Muqri' (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nThe people of Andalusia who followed him (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ninclude Shaikh Abu Bakr ibn Mawhab al-Maqburi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh Abu 'Abdullah ibn al-Hadhdha' (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh Abu Marwan al-Qanazi‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe people of Ceuta include Shaikh Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-\n'Ajuz (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abu Muhammad ibn Ghalib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and Shaikh Khalaf ibn Nasr (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). The people of the Maghrib include Shaikh Abu 'Ali ibn \nAmdakatu as-Sijilmasi (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nHis (rahmatullahi alaihi) books  \n \nHe has the Kitab an-Nawadir wa'z-Ziyadat 'ala'l-Mudawwana \nwhich is famous and has more than a hundred sections, and the \nfamous Mukhtasar (Summary) of the Mudawwana. Instruction in \nfiqh in the Maghrib is founded on these two books.  \n \nHe also wrote a revision of the 'Utibiyya, The Imitation of the \nPeople of Madina, The Defense of the School of Madina, the \nfamous Risala, the Kitab an-Tanbih on the position of the children \nof apostates, Waqfs for the Children of Notables, Explanation of \nthe Times of the Prayer, Trust and Reliance on Allah, The Book of \nGnosis and Certainty, Insurance of Provision, Kitab al-Manasik, a \ntreatise on those who are moved by the recitation of the Holy \nQur'an and dhikr, a book on Turning Away the Beggar, the \nProtection of the Reputation of the Believer, Kitab al-Bayan on the \ninimitability of the Holy Qur'an, Kitab al-Wasawis, a treatise on \ngiving relatives some of the zakat, a treatise prohibiting \nargumentation, a treatise refuting the Qadariyya and rebuttal to \nthe treatise of al-Baghdadi al-Mu'tazili, the Kitab al-Istizhar on \nthe refutation of the conceptualists [fikriya], Removal of \nUncertainty on the same topic, Book of Admonition and Counsel, \nTreatise on the Seeker of Knowledge, The Excellence of Praying at \nNight in Ramadan, Excellent Warning for the People of \nTruthfulness, a letter to the people of Sijilmasa on recitation of the \nHoly Qur'an, and a treatise on the fundamentals of tauhid. All of \nhis books are beneficial and extraordinary and full of knowledge.  \n \nIt is mentioned that one day he went to visit Abu Sa‟id \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), the nephew of Hisham (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nand \nfound \nhis \ngathering \nin \nsession. \nAbu \nSa‟id \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said to him, \"I have heard that you have \nwritten books.\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"may Allah azza wa jall make \nyou prosper!\" He said, \"Listen to a problem.\" Abu Muhammad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) told him, \"Mention it, may Allah azza wa jall \nmake you prosper. If I am correct, you will tell me. If I am wrong, \nyou will teach us.\" Abu Sa‟id (rahmatullahi alaihi) was silent and \ndid not do that again.  \n \nThe rest of his (rahmatullahi alaihi) reports  \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) was one of the \npeople of righteousness, scrupulousness and excellence. It is \nreported that he got up one night to do wudu' and poured water \nfrom the jug into the vessel and spilled it. Then he poured it again \nand spilled it. Then that happened a third time and he had some \ndoubts and remarked, \"You are recalcitrant towards us.\" He heard \nsomeone he could not see say, \"The child wet the bed over the jug \nand we disliked for you to do wudu' from it.\"  \n \nWhen he wrote his books about the conceptualists and criticized \nthe book of 'Abdu'r-Rahman as-Siqilli in al-Kashf and al-Istizhar \nand refuted a lot of what they had transmitted regarding miracles \n(kharq al-'adat) according to what was affirmed in his book, the \nfalse Sufis and a lot of the people of hadith objected to that and \nspread it about that he denied miracles (karamat), which he did \nnot do. Indeed, at the beginning of his book, he articulates his aim, \nwhich is to refute a certain group of people found in Andalusia and \nthe east. Many well-known books have been written on that, \nincluding the books of Abu'l-Hasan ibn Jahdam al-Hamdani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Abu Bakr al-Baqillani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Shaqq al-Layl (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Abu 'Umar at-Talamanki (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. \nThe most correctly guided of them in that and had the best \nknowledge of his aim and its worth was the Imam of his time, \nQadi Abu Bakr ibn at-Tayyib al-Baqillani (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nHe made his aim clear.  \n \nAl-Ajdabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I was sitting with Abu \nMuhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) when Abu'l-Qasim 'Abdu'r-\nRahman ibn 'Abdu'l-Mu'min (rahmatullahi alaihi) the mutakallim \nwas with him (rahmatullahi alaihi). A man asked them about al-\nKhidr \n and whether it could be said that he \n was still in \nthis world in spite of all this time and would not die until the \nFinal Hour comes and whether this is refuted by the words of the \nAlmighty, 'We did not give any human being before you \nimmortality.' (Holy Qur‟an 21:34) They both replied to him that \nthat was possible and permitted and al-Khidr \n could live until \nthe Final Trumpet was blown. Immortality is connected to \nremaining as long as the Next World remains, and remaining \nuntil the Trumpet is blown is not immortality. Do you not see that \nIblis - may Allah azza wa jall curse him - is not immortal, but he is \none of those deferred until the Day of a Known Time.  \n \nIt is mentioned that Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) wrote \nto Abu Bakr al-Aburri (rahmatullahi alaihi):  \n \nHearts refuse the hearts of a people when they have no \nportion with them. But selves choose selves while they have \nno portion with them. That is only because of secrets known \nby the All-Watchful Witness.  \n \nAbu'l-Qasim al-Lubaydi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"'Isa ibn \nThabit al-„Abid (rahmatullahi alaihi) met Shaikh Abu Muhammad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and they wept a lot together and \nadmonished one another. When he wanted to leave, 'Isa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said to him, 'I want you to write my name on \nthe carpet under you. When you see it, you can make supplication \nfor me. Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) wept and said to \nhim, 'Allah Almighty says, \"All good words rise to Him and He \nraises up all righteous deeds.\" (35:10) Let me make supplication \nfor you, but where are the righteous deeds to elevate it?'\"  \n \nHis (rahmatullahi alaihi) death  \n \nAbu Muhammad ibn Abi Zayd (rahmatullahi alaihi) died in 386 \nand was eulogized by a lot of the writers of Qayrawan who \ncomposed a number of moving elegies about him.  \n \nIt is mentioned that Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) was \nseen in his assembly reflecting in sorrow and he was asked what \nthe reason for that. He replied, \"I dreamt that the door of my \nhouse had fallen down. Al-Kirmani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that \nit indicates the death of the owner of the house.\" He was asked, \"Is \nal-Kirmani (rahmatullahi alaihi) considered to be like Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in his science?\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"In \nhis science, he is like Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is in his \nknowledge.\" It was not long after that that he died, may Allah \nazza wa jall have mercy on him.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Risala \nof \nShaikh Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) \n(310/922 - 386/996) \nA Treatise on Maliki Fiqh \n \n \n(Including commentary from ath-Thamr ad-Dani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) by al-Azhari (rahmatullahi alaihi))  \nAbu Muhammad Abdullah (rahmatullahi alaihi), a Maliki faqih \nknown as \"Shaikh al-Faqih\" and \"little Malik\". He was the head of \nthe Maliki School in Qayrawan. He wrote ar-Risala and an-\nNawadir and several other books.  \n(The translation here is not intended to be the final version,  \nbut it is hoped that it will be of some use to those looking  \nfor texts on Maliki fiqh.)  \nComments are welcome in the guest book.  \n \nIn the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate.  \n \nMay Allah azza wa jall bless our Master Muhammad and his \nfamily and Companions and give him peace.  \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad 'Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani, \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), says:  \n \nSHAIKH \nIBN \nABI'S \nZAYD'S \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nPROLOGUE  \n \nPraise be to Allah azza wa jall who begins the creation of man as a \nblessing from Him and fashions him in the womb by His wisdom \nand brings him out into His tender care and to the provision He \neases him to and teaches him what he did not know - \"Allah's \nbounty upon him is ever great.\"  \n \nAllah azza wa jall makes him aware of Himself through the signs \nin what He has made and has left no excuse for him by virtue of \nwhat His Messengers, the best of His creation, have brought. He \nguides in His generosity, those whom He has granted success and \nHe leads astray, in His justice, those for whom He has decreed \ndebasement. He eases the believers to ease in both the worlds and \nopens their hearts to the Reminder. So they believe in Allah azza \nwa jall, pronouncing this belief with their tongues, being sincere \nabout it in their hearts and acting according to what has come \ndown to them through His Messengers and His Books. They learn \nwhat He teaches them and keep within the limits that which He \nhas prescribed for them. They are happy with what He has made \nhalal for them and avoid what He has made haram for them.  \n \nMay Allah azza wa jall assist both us and you in taking care of \nwhat He has entrusted us with and in holding to His Shari‟ah. \nYou have asked me to write a short treatise for you about what is \nobligatory in the din - those things which should be pronounced by \nthe tongue and believed by the heart and done by the limbs; and \nabout those Sunnah‟s which are associated with these obligatory \nactions - the confirmed (mu'akkada), the optional (nafila) and the \ndesirable (raghiba); something about the courtesies (adab) \nassociated with them; along with certain of the key principles and \nderived judgments in jurisprudence (fiqh) according to the \nmadhhab and way of Imam Malik ibn Anas (rahmatullahi alaihi); \nand in addition to mention what the great men of knowledge and \nfiqh have said about unclear matters in the madhhab in order to \nmake them easier to understand.  \n \nYou have made this request because of your desire to teach these \nthings to children in the same way that you teach them how to \nread the Holy Qur'an so that they may first of all gain an \nunderstanding of the din of Allah azza wa jall and His Shari‟ah in \ntheir hearts, which will hopefully bring them blessing and a good \nend result.  \n \nI have responded to this out of the same hope of gaining for both \nmyself and you something of the reward of those who teach the \ndin of Allah azza wa jall or call to it.  \n \nKnow that the best of hearts is the one which contains the most \ngood and those hearts which are most likely to gain good are the \nones which no evil has been able to get into. The thing that the \npeople of advice are most concerned about and which those who \ndesire its reward most want is to put good into the hearts of the \nchildren of the believers so that it becomes firmly established in \nthem; and to make them realize what the bases of the din and the \nlimits of the Shari‟ah are in order that they may be satisfied with \nthat and to make them realize those things in the din which their \nhearts have to accept and their limbs are required to do.  \n \nIt is related that teaching the Book of Allah azza wa jall to young \nchildren extinguishes the anger of Allah azza wa jall and also that \nteaching something to someone in their childhood is like \nengraving it on stone.  \n \nI have made these things clear and if Allah azza wa jall wills they \nwill get benefit from learning them, nobility from knowing them \nand happiness from believing them and acting according to them.  \n \nIt has come down to us that children should be ordered to do the \nprayer at seven years old and beaten for not doing it at ten years \nold and be separated in their beds. Similarly, they should be \ntaught before they reach puberty those words and actions which \nAllah azza wa jall has made obligatory for people so that when \nthey reach puberty these things are fixed in their hearts and they \nare at ease with them and their limbs are used to doing them. For \nAllah azza wa jall has made certain beliefs obligatory for the heart \nand certain acts of obedience obligatory for the limbs.  \n \nI will arrange what I have undertaken to talk about in chapters so \nthat it will be easier, if Allah azza wa jall wills, for those who are \nstudying it to understand. It is Him we ask for guidance and Him \nwe ask for help. And there is no power nor strength except by \nAllah, the High, the Mighty. May Allah bless our Master \nMuhammad, His Prophet, and his family and Companions and \ngrant them much peace."

    "text": "ONE: CREEDS \n \nThe obligatory matters of the din that the tongue should give \nexpression to and in which the heart should believe.  \n \nThis chapter clarifies what should be expressed in words and what \nhearts should believe. It contains about a hundred items of creed, \nwhich can be divided into three basic categories: that which must \nbe believed about Allah azza wa jall, that which is impossible in \nrespect of Allah azza wa jall, and that which is permissible in \nrespect of Him.  \n \nThese are matters which all those who are legally responsible \nmust believe.  \n \n1.1 Beliefs regarding Allah azza wa jall \n \n1.1a \nTauhid \n-His \nOneness \nand \nDisconnection \nfrom \ncreatures (tanzih)  \n \nThese obligatory tenets include believing in the heart and \nexpressing with the tongue that Allah azza wa jall is One \nGod with no god other than Him, nor any likeness to Him, \nnor any equal to Him.  \n \nBelief is expressed on the tongue and confirmed by sincerity in the \nheart and action with the limbs. Thus it is composed of all three \naspects. Nonetheless, simple belief in the Oneness of Allah azza \nwa jall will save a person from being in the Fire for all eternity.  \n \nThe belief that Allah azza wa jall is One is the fundamental basis \nof Islam, and when Divine Unity is expressed, the name \"Allah\" \nmust be used. It is not permissible to say, \"There is no god but the \nAlmighty\" or use any other names except Allah. Nothing at all \nresembles Him or is equal to Him.  \n \nAl-Kalbi (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentions that the clear evidence for \nthis is found in four ayats: \"If there had been any gods except \nAllah in heaven or earth, they would both be ruined\" (Holy Qur‟an \n21:22); \"Say: 'If there had been other gods together with Him as \nyou say, they would have sought a way to the Master of the \nThrone'\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:42); \"Allah has no son and there is no \nother god accompanying Him, for then each god would have gone \noff with what he created and one of them would have been exalted \nabove the other\" (Holy Qur‟an 23:91); and \"But they have adopted \ngods apart from Him which do not create anything. They are \nthemselves created.\" (Holy Qur‟an 25:3)  \n \n1.1b Lack of Associates  \n \nHe has had no child. He had no father. He has no wife. He \nhas no partner.  \n \nSee the Holy Qur'an 112: \"Say: He is Allah, One with no other, \nAllah the Everlasting Sustainer of all. He has not given birth and \nwas not born and there is no one is equal to Him,\" and \"And say: \n'Praise be to Allah Who has had no son and Who has no partner in \nHis Kingdom and Who needs no one to protect Him from \nabasement.'\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:111)  \n \nHe is totally unique. If he were to have a wife or partner, that \nwould imply need, and He is absolutely beyond need.  \n \n1.1c Lack of Temporality  \n \nThere is no beginning to His firstness nor any end to His \nlastness.  \n \nHis existence does not begin with firstness so that there is a point \nat which He could be said to begin nor does He have a point at \nwhich He could be said to end. He exists eternally, out of time, \nbefore time and after time.  \n \n1.1d Ineffability and Indefinability  \n \nThose who try to describe Him can never adequately do so \nnor can thinkers encompass Him in their thought. Real \nthinkers may derive lessons from His signs but do not try \nto think about the nature of His Essence. \"But they do not \nattain any of His knowledge except what He wills.\" (Holy \nQur’an 2:254)  \n \n It is impossible to grasp His true description, let alone His \nEssence. Thinkers must learn through the Signs which indicate \nthe splendor of His Power, but must not attempt to reflect on the \nnature of His Essence because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Reflect on His creation, but do not reflect on His \nEssence.\"  \n \n1.1e His Footstool  \n \n\"His Footstool embraces the heavens and the earth, and \ntheir preservation does not tire Him. He is the Most High, \nthe Magnificent\" (Holy Qur’an 2:254)  \n \nHe has full control and authority over all creation, high and low, \nand His preservation of them is no burden for Him.  \n \n1.1f His Attributes  \n \nThe All-Knower and the All-Aware, the Arranger and the \nAll-Powerful. The All-Hearer and the All-Seeing. The High \nand the Great. He is over His Glorious Throne by His \nEssence.  \n \nHe has knowledge of all things, and complete power and authority \nover all things. His hearing and vision is connected to all things in \nexistence.  \n \n1.1g His knowledge  \n \nHe is everywhere by His knowledge. He created man and \nHe knows what his self whispers to him and He is nearer to \nhim than his jugular vein. No leaf falls without him \nknowing of it nor is there any seed in the darkness of the \nearth, nor any fresh thing nor any dry thing, that is not in \na clear book.  \n \nHe knows our inner dialogue and thoughts. He is closer to man \nthat his jugular vein, which is his physical body, and so He is \ncloser to man than his own physicality. \"We created man and We \nknow what his own self whispers to him, and We are nearer to \nhim than his jugular vein.\" (Holy Qur‟an 50:16) In addition to the \nuniversal scope of His knowledge, He knows the precise details, \nlike each individual leaf which falls – and it only falls by His will \nand \nin \naccordance \nwith \nHis \nknowledge. \nEverything \nis \nencompassed by His knowledge, dead or alive, growing or \ndormant. \"The keys of the Unseen are in His possession. No one \nknows them except for Him. He knows everything in the land and \nsea. Not a leaf falls without His knowing it. There is no seed in the \ndarkness of the earth, and no wet thing or dry thing, but that it is \nin a Clear Book.\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:59)  \n \n1.1h Mastery over all creation  \n \nHe is firmly established on His throne and has absolute \ncontrol over His kingdom.  \n \nNo one knows the true interpretation of this expression. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) was asked about it and said, \"'Firmly \nestablished' is known but 'how' is not known.\" Nothing is hidden \nfrom Him and His control is absolute. \"He then established \nHimself firmly on the Throne.\" (Holy Qur‟an 10:3, etc.)  \n \n1.1i His Names and Attributes  \n \nHe has the most beautiful names and the most sublime attributes \nand He has always had all these names and attributes. He is \nexalted above any of His attributes ever having been created or \nany of His names having been brought into temporal (worldly) \nexistence.  \n \nHe is described by the best and noblest of the meanings of His \nNames. He has attributes like power, will, height, and so forth. He \nis high, exalted over any imperfection or short-coming. These \nNames have always been His and will remain His. Thus neither \nHis names nor His attributes are created. They are simply His. \n\"To Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names\" (Holy Qur‟an 7:180)  \n \n1.1j His Speech and Manifestation  \n \nHe spoke to Nabi Musa (alaihi salam) with His speech which \nis an attribute of His essence and not something created. \nHe \nmanifested \nHimself \nto \nthe \nmountain \nand \nit \ndisintegrated through exposure to His majesty.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall spoke to Nabi Musa (alaihi salam) with His \ntimeless words and Nabi Musa (alaihi salam) actually heard His \ntimeless speech. “When Musa came to Our appointed time and his \nLord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show me Yourself so that I \nmay look at You!' He said, 'You will not see Me, but look at the \nmountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.' \nBut when His Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He \ncrushed it flat and Musa fell unconscious to the ground.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 7:143)  \n \n1.2  Belief in the Holy Qur'an  \n \nThe Holy Qur'an is the speech of Allah azza wa jall, not \nsomething created which must therefore die out, nor the \nattribute of something created which must therefore come \nto an end.  \n \nThe Holy Qur'an is the speech of Allah azza wa jall which is not \ncreated and is timeless, outside of temporal (earthly, mortal) time. \nHence it will not end as creatures must end, but will abide \nendlessly.  \n \n1.3  Belief in the Decree (Qadar)  \n \n1.3a The Prior Decree of Good and Evil  \n \nAlso included is belief in the Decree both the good of it and \nthe evil of it, the sweet of it and the bitter of it. All of this \nhas been decreed by Allah azza wa jall, our Lord. The way \nthings are decided is entirely in His hand and the way they \nhappen is according to His decree. He knows all things \nbefore they come into existence and they take place in the \nway He has already decided.  \n \nIt is necessary to believe that all things, good and evil, are decreed \nby Allah azza wa jall and nothing escapes His will and thus only \nwhat He wills occurs in His kingdom. All things and their being \nbrought into existence from the concealment of non-existence to \nthe domain of manifestation in their myriad aspects and forms – \nlong and short, at one time rather than one, in one place rather \nthan another. All of that occurs and issues directly from His \nDecree according to His knowledge and dependent on His will.  \n \n1.3b Prior Knowledge  \n \nThere is nothing that His servants say or do which He has \nnot decreed and does not have knowledge of. \"Does not He \nwho creates know, when He is the Subtle and the Aware.\" \n(Holy Qur’an 67:14)  \n \nHe knows everything which happens before it happens. It only \noccurs in accordance with His knowledge of it.  \n \n1.3c The Prior Predisposition of People  \n \nHe leads astray whoever He wills and in His justice \ndebases them and He guides whoever He wills and in His \ngenerosity grants them success. In that way everyone is \neased by Him to what He already has knowledge of and has \npreviously decreed as to whether they are to be among the \nfortunate or the miserable.  \n \nEvery man has prior disposition to what Allah azza wa jall \nalready knows about him being happy or wretched because Allah \nazza wa jall only created man according to His knowledge. See \nHoly Qur'an 14:4, 3:160, etc.  \n \n1.3d Exaltedness of Allah azza wa jall's power  \n \nHe is exalted above there being anything He does not \ndesire in His kingdom, or that there should be anything \nnot dependent on Him, or that there should be any creator \nof anything other than Him, the Lord of all people, the \nLord of their actions, the One who decrees their \nmovements and the time of their death.  \n \n The power of Allah azza wa jall is so immense and vast that there \nis nothing which is not directly under his authority and subject to \nHis will. All things - might and abasement, wealth and poverty, \npious actions and all things are subject to His will and power.  \n \n1.4  Belief in the Messengers (may Allah azza wa jall bless \nthem all) and the Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \n1.4a The sending of Messengers (may Allah azza wa jall \nbless them all) \n \nHe has sent Messengers to them in order that they should \nhave no argument against Him.  \n \nThe first of the Prophets was Nabi Adam (alaihi salam) and the \nlast was Nabi Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam). One must \nbelieve and accept that Allah azza wa jall sent the Messengers \n(may He bless them all) to those who are legally responsible, i.e. \nadult and sane, and they conveyed the Message. The wisdom of \nsending the Messengers (may He bless them all) is that it removes \nany excuse which creatures might offer about not having heard \nthe Message.  \n \n1. 4b The Final Messenger (alaihi salat wa salam) \n \nHe sealed this Messengership, warning, and Prophethood \nwith his Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam), \nwhom He made the last of the Messengers - \"A bringer of \ngood news and a warner, calling to Allah azza wa jall by \nHis permission and an illuminating lamp.\"  \n \nRevelation, which is warning and prophethood, which is informing \nabout what Allah azza wa jall has said, reaches its end with the \nHoly Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam). There will be \nno Prophets after him. He brings the good news that whoever \nfollows him will be happy and whoever does not will be punished. \nHe calls to Allah azza wa jall, conveying tauhid to the legally \nresponsible, and fighting the unbelievers. He is an illuminating \nlight because his Shari‟ah is a light which guides the bewildered – \nwhoever follows it and proceeds along the Straight Path will \nemerge from the darkness of disbelief to the light of belief.  \n \n1.4c Divine Guidance through the Book  \n \nHe sent down on him His Wise Book and by means of him \nHe explained His upright din and guided people to the \nStraight Path.  \n \nOne must believe and affirm that Allah azza wa jall revealed to \nHis Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) a Book \ncontaining judgment and wisdom to which no falsehood at all \ncomes. Allah azza wa jall opened and expanded the Straight din of \nIslam through His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Thus He \nmanifests its judgments and clarifies it on the tongue of His Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam). Allah azza wa jall only sent down \nthe revelation to us so that it would be clear to people. The \nguidance of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) \nis the sun of knowledge‟s, the source of right guidance and the \nfount of certainty which guides people to the Straight Path.  \n \n1.5  Belief in the Resurrection and Judgment  \n \n1.5a The Last Hour  \n \nAlso part of what must be believed is that the Hour is \ncoming - there is no doubt about it.  \n \n(Holy Qur‟an 40:59) This must be confirmed and believed and the \none who denies that the Final Hour will come is an unbeliever. \nHowever, but only the All-Knower of the Unseen knows when it \nwill come.  \n \n1.5b Resurrection of the Dead  \n \nIt must be believed that Allah azza wa jall will raise up all \nwho have died: \"As He brought them into existence the first \ntime so they will be brought back again;\"  \n \nIt must be believed that He will bring the dead back to life after \nthey are dead and bring them back for the Gathering. There is no \ndisagreement among Muslims that it will occur, but there is \ndisagreement about whether He will bring them back from \nabsolutely nothing or from dissolution through a reconstitution of \ntheir parts.  \n \n1.5c Divine Reward: Multiplication of Good Actions  \n \nIt must be believed that Allah azza wa jall multiplies the \nreward of the good actions of His believing servants.  \n \nIt must be believed that Allah azza wa jall will multiply good \nactions for the believers according to sincerity and degrees of \nhumility, so that multiplication can be from ten to 700, in other \nwords, a great deal. Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) transmitted that Allah azza wa jall multiplies the good \naction a thousand times. This means the reward for doing them. \nThe \"good action\" is what is praised in the Shari‟ah, and what is \nthe opposite of that is a \"bad action\", which is what the Shari‟ah \nconsiders reprehensible.  \n \n1.5d Pardoning Wrong Actions  \n \nHe pardons them for their major wrong actions by virtue \nof their repentance (tauba) and forgives them for their \nminor wrong actions by virtue of their avoidance of the \nmajor wrong actions.  \n \nPart of His bounty to His believing servants is that if anyone does \nany major wrong actions and then repents and makes amends, He \nwill pardon Him by His favor and generosity. Small wrong actions \nare expiated by avoiding major ones.  \n \n1.5e Those who do not repent are subject to His will  \n \nThose who do not repent of their major wrong actions \nbecome subject to His will. \"He does not forgive anything \nbeing associated with Him, but He forgives anything other \nthan that to whoever He wills.\"  \n \nThose believers who commit major wrong actions and die without \nrepenting of them are subject to the Will of Allah. If He wishes, He \nwill forgive them out of His favor. If He wishes, He will punish \nthem out of justice. He may forgive everything except for \nassociating others with Him.  \n \n1.5f Deliverance from the Fire because of belief  \n \nThose He punishes with His Fire, He will remove from it \nbecause of any belief they have and by this He will cause \nthem to enter His Garden. \"Whoever does an atom's weight \nof good will see it.\" (Holy Qur’an 99:7)  \n \nIt must also be accepted that if Allah azza wa jall wills that the \nrebels among the believers be punished in the Abode of \nPunishment, their punishment will be commensurate with what \nthey have brought on themselves by their evil deeds and then \nmercy will envelop them and they will emerge from the Abode of \nPunishment and enter the Abode of Peace. Whoever has the \nweight of atom of belief in his heart will not be in the Fire forever. \nThus belief is a reason for not being forever in the Punishment \nand a reason for entering the Garden with Allah azza wa jall's \npardon and mercy.  \n \n1.5g The Intercession of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \nAny of the community of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) who have committed major wrong actions and for \nwhom he intercedes, will be brought out of the Fire by his \nintercession.  \n \nThe intercession of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nothers must be affirmed. He is singled out for mention because he \nis the first intercessor and by the intercession of our Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) the people of major wrong actions of his \ncommunity of unifiers will emerge from the Fire. The Mu'tazilites \ndeny intercession, based on the lack of permission to pardon and \noverlook wrong actions, but we defer to transmitted evidence and \nthey hold to merely logical evidence. Transmitted evidence is more \nsublime and radiant.  \n \n1.6 The Afterlife: the Garden and the Fire  \n \n1.6a The Garden  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has created the Garden and has made it \nready as an everlasting abode for His friends (awliya'). He \nwill honor them in it with the vision of His Noble Face. \nThis is the same Garden from which He sent down Nabi \nAdam (alaihi salam), His Prophet and Khalif, to the earth, \nwhich was as it had already been decreed in His \nforeknowledge.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has created the everlasting abode of the Garden \nfor the believers in which they will have no toil or fatigue, but will \nbe rejoicing and will be blessed by contemplation of His Face. See \nHoly Qur‟an 75:23.  \n \n1.6b The Fire  \n \nHe has created the Fire and has made it ready as an \neverlasting abode for those who disbelieve in him and deny \nHis signs and Books and Messengers (may He bless them \nall) and He keeps them veiled from seeing Him.  \n \nHe created the Fire as an eternal abode of punishment for those \nwho deny and reject Him and ignored the evidence which \nindicates the existence and oneness of the Creator and denied His \nrevealed Books and Messengers (may He bless them all). They will \nabide in the hatred resulting from disbelief and will be veiled from \nseeing their Lord on that day.  \n \n1.7 Details of the Resurrection  \n \n1.7a The Coming of Allah azza wa jall and the Angels  \n \nAllah azza wa jall will come on the Day of Rising together \nwith the angels, rank upon rank.  \n \nIt is confirmed by transmission that on the Day of Resurrection \nAllah azza wa jall will come with angels in ranks. That must be \nbelieved, and its knowledge comes from the Lawgiver. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others say about this ayat (Holy \nQur‟an 89:22) and others that they are read as they have come \nwithout qualification. We take what they say literally but do not \ncompare it to any creature.  \n \n1.7b Presentation of Peoples  \n \nAll the different peoples are confronted with their \naccounts and their punishment or reward.  \n \nAll the different peoples will come to present themselves so that \ntheir states will be investigated and reckoning taken for their \nactions. The actions of those who present themselves for the \nReckoning will have their good and bad actions enumerated.  The \nbeliever will be called to account with graciousness and favor and \nthe hypocrite and unbeliever with evidence and justice. So Allah \nazza wa jall will say to the believer, \"I veiled it for you in the \nworld and I forgive it for you on the Day of Rising.\" The \nunbelievers will be reckoned in front of witnesses and those who \nthey denied will be summoned to their Lord, \"The curse of Allah \non wrongdoers.\"  \n \n1.7c The Balance  \n \nThe balances will be set up to weigh people's actions - \n\"Whoever’s actions are heavy in the balance - they are the \nsuccessful.\"  \n \nSee Holy Qur‟an 21:47; 101:6. The balances will be set up to \nmanifest justice so that no one will be wronged even the weight of \na mustard grain. Allah azza wa jall will bring all the person's \nactions, even to an atom's weight, on the Day of Resurrection. \nWhoever has his balance heavy will be successful and achieve a \nhappiness after which there will be no misery. Whoever has his \nbalance light will be wretched and will have no happiness after his \nwretchedness.  \n \n1.7d The Books of Actions  \n \nPeople will be given pages on which their actions are \nrecorded - \"Whoever is given his book in his right hand will \nbe given an easy accounting and whoever is given his book \nbehind his back - they will burn in a Fire.\" (Holy Qur’an \n84:7-13)  \n \nNations will be given their pages which contain their actions. \nWhen they are given them, Allah azza wa jall will create \nknowledge in them and they will understand what they contain. If \nsomeone is given his book in his right hand, that indicates that he \nis one of the people of the right hand and happiness. If someone is \ngiven his book in his left hand, that is an indication that he is one \nof the people of misery.\" The receiving of the books should actually \nbe put before the balance and weighing of actions because the \nweighing is after the Reckoning and the Reckoning is after \nreceiving the Books.  \n \n1.7e The Sirat  \n \nThe Bridge (sirat) is true and people will cross it according \nto their actions. Those who cross it, and achieve safety \nfrom the Fire, do so at different speeds, while the actions \nof others cast them to their destruction in the Fire.  \n \nThere is a great deal of description of the Sirat and it is said that \nit is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. Shaikh al-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), on the other hand, says that it is wide with \ntwo paths on it, one to the right and one to the left. The people of \nhappiness travel on the right and the people of wretchedness on \nthe left.  \n \nThere are ropes on it and each rope leads to one of the levels of \nJahannam and Jahannam lies between the creatures and the \nGarden. The Sirat is set up over Jahannam, and none of the \npeople of the Garden enters the Garden until he has crossed over \nthe Sirat.  \n \nPeople will cross over the Sirat according to the disparity in their \nactions and avoidance of the things forbidden by Allah azza wa \njall. Some will pass over like lightning. Some will escape the \nhooks, some will be scratched but released, and some will be \ncaught by the hooks and tipped into the Fire of Jahannam.  \n \n1.7f The Basin  \n \nAlso included is belief in the Basin (Hawd) of the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) which his community will \ncome down to drink from after which they will never feel \nthirst again. But those who make any changes or \nalterations in the din will be driven from it.  \n \nIt is necessary to believe in the Basin of the Rasulullah (alaihi \nsalat wa salam). He will drive away from it those who alter things, \nlike the apostates and those of his followers who follow him with \nthe best will drink from it when they leave their graves thirsty. \nWhoever drinks from it will never feel thirst again.  \n \n1.8 Belief  \n \n1.8a Definition of Belief  \n \nBelief consists of what you say with the tongue, what you \nbelieve sincerely in the heart, and what you do with the \nlimbs.  \n \nBelief is articulation of the shahadah, belief in the truthfulness of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and what he brought in \nthe heart and then acting according to the judgments of the \nShari‟ah, like praying and fasting. Someone with all of these three \nis a believer. If someone believes that belief does not consist of \nthese three and imagines that what the author said was due to his \ninclination to what belief obliges because there is consensus that \nsomeone who believes with his heart, speaks with his tongue and \nacts with his limbs is a believer. If he does not believe that belief \nconsists of these three, he takes it as a preface to the words which \nfollow:  \n \n1.8b Increase and Decrease of Belief  \n \nIt increases when your actions increase and decreases \nwhen they decrease. So it is through actions or the lack of \nthem that increase and decrease in belief occurs.  \n \nIt increases according to actions and decreases according to \nactions. This increase and decrease is in relation to its fruits. This \nis the school of the early and later people of the community, and \nthis is the final position taken in the matter by Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He first had said that it increases and does \nnot decrease. Applying the name “belief\" to action is agreed upon. \nThe Almighty says, \"Allah would not let your belief go to waste,\" \nwhich referred to the prayers they did facing Jerusalem.  \n \n1.8c The intention and following the Sunnah  \n \nThe statement of belief is not complete without action. \nNeither the statement nor action are complete without \nintention. And neither the statement nor intention are \ncomplete unless they are in accordance with the sunnah.  \n \nActions and words are according to intentions. The intention is the \nfulcrum upon which actions are based, and so a man should only \nbase his actions on the pure sunnah and straight Shari‟ah and \nfollow the Rightly-guided khalifs (may Allah azza wa jall be \npleased with them).  \n \n1.8d Islam and Wrong actions  \n \nNo Muslim becomes an unbeliever (kafir) through wrong \nactions.  \n \nIt must be believed that no Muslim who commits a wrong action \nbecomes an unbeliever as long as he believes. The same applies to \nsomeone who commits acts of disobedience while he nevertheless \nbelieves that the Shari‟ah forbids them. If someone does \nsomething which shows that he lacks belief, like throwing a copy \nof the Holy Qur'an into the rubbish, then he is an apostate. We are \nnot discussing him. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Whoever faces our qibla and eats our sacrifices is truly a \nbeliever.\" The Kharijites were heretics when they said that every \nsin is a major wrong action and every major wrong action removes \nactions and the one who does that is an unbeliever. The \nMu'tazilites said that every major wrong action renders actions \nvoid and the one who commits it is between two stations, and he is \nnot called a believer or an unbeliever. He is called a deviant \n(fasiq).  \n \n1.8e Martyrs  \n \nMartyrs (shuhada') are alive, receiving their provision in \nthe presence of their Lord.  \n \nIt is obligatory to believe that the martyrs, those who fought the \nunbelievers and were killed in the way of Allah azza wa jall to \nelevate the word of Allah azza wa jall, are alive and delighting in \nthe Presence of their Lord because of the privileges they have been \ngranted, one of which is that they will be secure from the Greatest \nTerror on the Day of Rising. See Holy Qur'an 3:169.  \n \n1.8f In the grave: the spirits of the fortunate \n \nThe spirits of the fortunate remain in bliss until the day \nthey are raised again.  \n \nThe souls of the fortunate will remain in bliss until the Day of \nRising seeing their place in the Garden. When one of them dies, he \nis shown his place in the Garden morning and evening.  \n \n1.8g In the grave: the spirits of the miserable  \n \nThe spirits of the miserable are tormented until the Day of \nJudgment.  \n \nThe souls of the wretched are punished by seeing their place in \nthe Fire and other punishments.  \n \n1.8h The questioning in the grave  \n \nThe believers are tried and questioned in their graves. \n\"Allah makes those who believe firm by giving them firm \nwords in the life of this world and the next world.\"  \n \nThis refers to the questioning by the two angels in the grave. The \ndead person will be placed in his grave and people will leave him \nand then two angels come and sit with him and ask him, \"Who is \nyour Lord? What is your din? Who is your Prophet?\" The believer \nwill reply, \"My Lord is Allah azza wa jall. My din is Islam, My \nProphet is Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam),\" and his grave will \nbe wide for him. When the unbeliever is in the grave and is asked \nthese questions, he will reply, \"I do not know,\" and so he will be \ndealt a blow from an iron hammer and will scream so that all \ncreatures except men and jinn will hear him. Also reported is the \nconstriction of the grave, which is the pressing on the sides of the \nbody of the dead person and none is safe from that except the one \nwhom Allah azza wa jall grants an exception - they include \nFatima bint Asad (radhi’Allahu anha) the mother of 'Ali ibn Abi \nTalib (radhi’Allahu anhu) because of the blessing of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) going into her grave, and whoever \nrecites Surat al-Ikhlas in his final illness.\"  \n \n1.9 The Angels \n \n1.9a The Recording Angels  \n \nPeople have recording angels over them who write down \ntheir actions. Nothing people do escapes the knowledge of \ntheir Lord.  \n \nMen and jinn, believers and unbelievers, free and slave, have \nrecording angels who write down their actions, even the \npermissible ones and the groan in illness, and even the actions of \nthe heart, like all the thoughts which occur to it. Allah azza wa \njall has given the heart a token by which it can distinguish \nbetween the good and bad action. The source for the knowledge of \nthat is the words of the Almighty, \"Standing over you are \nguardians, noble, recording. They know everything you do,\" (Holy \nQur‟an 82:10-12) and the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam), \"The angels of the day and night succeed one another.\" \nThere is consensus on that. None of the actions are hidden from \nAllah azza wa jall. That is part of the subtlety of Allah azza wa \njall regarding His slaves since they know that Allah azza wa jall \nhas recording angels who record their actions and that will \nprevent them from acts of disobedience and the proof will be \nestablished against them when they reject and deny.  \n \n1.9b The Angel of Death  \n \nThe angel of death seizes people's spirits by the permission \nof his Lord.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has delegated an angel called 'Azra'il (alaihi \nsalam) to take the spirits of creatures, men, jinn and other birds \nand all animals who have a spirit. The Almighty says, \"Allah \ntakes back all souls at the time of their death,\" (Holy Qur‟an \n39:42) and He says, \"Then when death comes to one of you, Our \nmessengers take him,\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:61) however the outward \nappearance differs from this. The action is ascribed to Allah azza \nwa jall because He is the one who does it in reality, and the \nattribution of taking the spirits is to the Angel of Death \n \nbecause he does it directly by the permission of Allah azza wa jall. \nTaking is ascribed to the angels who are messengers because they \nassist the Angel of Death (alaihi salam) in taking the spirits.  \n \n1.10 Authorities  \n \n1.10a The Best generation  \n \nThe best generation are those who saw the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and believed in him. Then those who \nfollowed them and then those who followed them.  \n \nThe best generation is those who were alive in the time of the \nHoly Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) and believed in \nhim, respected and helped and followed the Light which was sent \ndown with him and the suns of his prophethood shone on them \nand they won and chose the virtue of being a Companion. Their \ngeneration is the best generation. This is in accordance with his \nwords, \"The best of you is my generation and those who follow \nthem and then those who follow them.  \n \n1.10b The best Companions  \n \nThe best of the Companions (Sahaba) are the rightly-\nguided khalifs. Firstly, Abu Bakr (radhi’Allahu anhu), then \n'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu), then 'Uthman (radhi’Allahu \nanhu), then 'Ali (radhi’Allahu anhu). \n  \nNot all the Companions had the same degree, but they varied in \ntheir degrees of excellence. The Rightly-guided Khalifs are the \nbest and in order of excellence they were Abu Bakr, then 'Umar, \nthen 'Uthman, then 'Ali, may Allah azza wa jall be pleased with \nall of them.  \n \n1.10c Respect for all the Companions  \n \nNone of the Companions of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) should be mentioned except in the best way and \nsilence \nshould \nbe \nmaintained \nconcerning \nany \ndisagreements that broke out between them. They are the \npeople who are most worthy of being considered in the \nbest light possible and the people whose opinions should \nbe most respected.  \n \nOne should avoid getting embroiled in the quarrels between them \nand one must always take the best interpretation in holding an \nopinion regarding them. They must always be thought about in \nthe best possible light.  \n \n1.10d Those in authority  \n \nObedience to the leaders of the Muslims, both their rulers \nand their men of knowledge, is obligatory.  \n \nIt is obligatory to obey the Imams of the Muslims who are in \nauthority who are responsible for the best interests of the \nMuslims. If they command what is correct, it is obligatory to obey, \nand if they forbid the reprehensible, it is obligatory to refrain. It is \nonly obligatory to obey the scholars who act by their knowledge \nand command the correct and forbid the reprehensible and \npreserve the limits of Allah azza wa jall. The evidence for the \nobligation is the words of the Almighty, \"Obey Allah and obey the \nMessenger and those in command among you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:58) \nThe one who transgresses is not obeyed because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no obedience due to a \ncreature which involves disobedience to the Creator.\" (Imam ibn \nHanbal (radhi’Allahu anhu) & Shaikh al-Hakim (radhi’Allahu \nanhu) \n \n1.10e The Salaf  \n \nIt is also obligatory to follow the Right-acting Companions, \nto tread in their footsteps and ask forgiveness for them.  \n \nIt is obliged to follow the righteous Salaf who are the Companions, \nin their words and actions, whether it is learned from them or by \nderivation and ijtihad. Similarly one must pray for forgiveness for \nthem.  \n \n1.10f Avoiding Disputation  \n \nIt is also obligatory to avoid wrangling and argumentation \nregarding the din  \n \nIt is necessary to avoid wrangling and arguments about the din. \nWrangling is to deny the truth after it is clear. Argumentation is \nto quarrel with the people of innovations. That is forbidden \nbecause it could lead to attacking the Companions (may Allah \nazza wa jall bless them all) and cause doubt in the heart. If the \naim of the argument is to set forth the truth without obduracy \n(stubbornness), then it is permitted.  \n \n1.10g Avoiding Innovations  \n \n...and to avoid every new thing which people have \nintroduced into it.  \n \nAvoid innovations because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"If anyone innovates something in this business of \nours which is not part of it, it is rejected.\" This is applied to \ninnovations which did not occur in his time and which the \nShari‟ah indicates are unlawful, according to some. Some believe \nthat innovation is what did not occur in this time, whether the \nShari‟ah indicates that it is unlawful, obligatory, recommended, \ndisliked or permitted. Innovations are found in all five categories. \nThis is what is stated by Shaikh ibn Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others.  \n \nMay Allah azza wa jall bless and give much peace to our \nMaster Muhammad, His Prophet, and his family and his \nwives and his descendants.  \n \n \n \nChapter Two: What Necessitates Wudu' and \nGhusl \n \n \nThis chapter deals with those things which render necessary \nwudu' and ghusl.  \n \nWudu' designates the action and wadu' designates the water. \nLinguistically it means cleanliness and excellence, and in the \nShari‟ah it means to purify certain parts of the body with water to \nmake them clean and to remove the judgment of 'minor impurity\" \n(hadath) from them to permit acts of worship which are forbidden \nby lack of purity.  \n \nQadi ibn al-'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that there is a known \ndispute about whether ghasl means the action and ghusl the \nwater. However, in adh-Dhakira, ghusl designates the action and \nghasl the water. This is the most common position.  \n \nThe obligation of Wudu' and Ghusl  \n \nEvidence for the obligatory nature of wudu' and ghusl is found in \nthe Holy Qur'an and Sunnah and consensus. The Almighty says, \n\"O you who believe! When you get up intending to do the prayer, \nwash your faces \" (Holy Qur‟an 5:6) and \"Do not approach the \nprayer when you are drunk until you know what you are saying, \nnor in a state of major impurity - unless you are traveling - until \nyou have washed yourselves completely.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:43) The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah azza wa jall does \nnot accept the prayer of anyone in a state of impurity until he does \nwudu'.\" There is no disagreement between the Imams that it is \nobligatory.  \n \n2.1 Wudu'  \n \n2.1a Preconditions for wudu':  \n \nThere are certain preconditions for the validity of wudu':  \n \n1. Islam  \n \n2. Adulthood  \n \n3. Sanity  \n \n4. Absence of menstrual blood or bleeding after childbirth  \n \n5. The arrival of the time of the prayer,  \n \n6. That the legally responsible person is not forgetful, asleep or \ninsensible  \n \n7. The existence of adequate water to perform it  \n \n8. The possibility of doing it with due care to achieve what is \ndesired, which may preclude the sick and the person who is \ncompelled.  \n \n2.1b What makes wudu' necessary  \n \nTwo things oblige wudu': ritual impurity and certain causes. \n[Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says three things: ritual \nimpurities, causes; and apostasy and doubt.]  \n \nRitual impurity is what breaks wudu' in itself, like urine, and \ncauses are things which do not break wudu' in themselves but \nleads to ritual impurity, like loss of sanity, touching someone with \ndesire and touching the penis. Shaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) states that apostasy also breaks wudu'.  \n \n2.1c The nature of the obligation  \n \nThe duty of wudu' is one of an obligatory nature, not merely an \nobligation inasmuch as it is Sunnah and thus strongly \nrecommended.  \n \n2.1d Urination and defecation in a normal manner  \n \nWudu' must be done when something emerges from one of the two \nnormal passages, the urethra and the anus, in a normal manner. \nIt is limited to what is normal which excludes anything which \nemerges abnormally, like pebbles and worms. They do not break \nwudu', even if he passes some urine and feces. Urine and feces \nmust emerge in a normal manner. So if it emerges for a specific \nreason, like incontinence in most cases, which is when he does it \nconstantly, most of the time or half of the time, then it does not \nbreak wudu'. In the first case, wudu' is neither obligatory or \nrecommended. In the last two cases it is recommended unless that \nis difficult for him.  \n \nThe 'passages' are limited to what emerges normally, which \nprecludes what emerges other than urine and feces, like blood as a \nresult of leeches and cupping, vomit which is changed from food, \nand impurity which emerges from a split under the intestines \nwhich is not due to the passages being blocked. When the two \npassages are blocked and the split is located under the intestines, \nthen it is considered as a normal orifice.  \n \n2.2 Things which break wudu'  \n \n2.2a Excreta which oblige wudu'  \n \nYou have to do wudu' after urinating or defecating or \npassing wind.  \n \nThis clarifies what excreta which make wudu' necessary: urine \nfrom the front orifice and feces from the rear orifice and passing \nwind, which designates wind which emerges from the anus, \nwhether or not with a sound. As for wind which emerges from the \npenis or vagina, it does not require wudu' since it is not considered \nas one of things which break wudu'.  \n \n2.2b Other fluids which require wudu': Madhy  \n \nYou have to do wudu' when the liquid known as madhy \ncomes out of the penis, in which case it is necessary to \nwash to the whole penis as well. Madhy is a thin, white \nliquid which comes out at times of sexual excitement when \nthe penis is erect, either during sexual foreplay or when \nthinking about it.  \n \nWudu' is obliged when madhy emerges from the penis. It is also \nobligatory to wash the entire penis with an intention before doing \nwudu'. Wudu' is specified and using stones in not enough.  \n \n2.2c Wady  \n \nWady is a thick white liquid which comes out usually after \nurinating and carries the same judgment regarding \ncleaning the penis as urine.  \n \nWady is dense and usually comes out after urination. It may come \nout on its own or during urination. It makes wudu' necessary and \nit must be completely removed. He should lightly squeeze the \nplace and wash only its place.  \n \n2.2d Sperm (maniyy)  \n \nSperm - maniyy - is the white liquid ejaculated at orgasm \nduring sexual intercourse which smells similar to the \npollen of the date-palm.  \n \nThe emission of sperm is one of things which obliges ghusl, not \nwudu'. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it here among \nthe things which oblige wudu' as a digression since it does oblige \nwudu' in certain cases. It is what issues with pleasure which is not \nusual, although it is mentioned among the things which oblige \nghusl. Here he mentioned the fluids which flow from the front \norifice, and maniyy is one of them. It is ejaculated in spurts and \nhas a particular odor.  \n \n2.2e Women's discharge and menstruation  \n \nThe liquid which comes from a woman is a thin yellow \nfluid and necessitates purification, that is purification of \nthe whole body as is the case after menstruation.  \n \nA woman's liquid which she discharges, which is her maniyy, is \ndescribed as being thin and yellowish when it normally emerges \nand in health, not on account of illness or incontinence. Ghusl is \nobliged on account of it. It is not a precondition that it emerge \noutside. It is based on the sensation, and so the mere sensation \nobliges her to purify herself, as she is obliged to do when \nmenstruation ends.  \n \n2.2f False menstruation  \n \nIn the case of bleeding which continues beyond the normal \nperiod of menstruation (istihada), only wudu' is necessary, \nalthough in such circumstances it is recommended for a \nwoman to repeat wudu' for every prayer.  \n \nThe blood of false menstruation is blood which flows outside the \ndays of menstruation and lochia, issuing from a vein which is in \nthe lower part of the uterus. The judgment in such a case is that \nwudu' is obligatory when it stops more than it comes. When it \ncomes more than it stops or the two are equal, then she is not \nobliged to do wudu'.  \n \nMenstruation according to Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe normal age of menstruation is considered from the age of \nadolescence to the age of 50. The individual is consulted from the \nage of 9 to puberty and from 50 to 70. It can be red, yellow or \nbrown. The minimum is one gush and its maximum is fifteen \ndays. The minimum of purity is fifteen days and it has no \nmaximum. And the maximum length of menstruation for someone \nwith normal periods (even if she has only had one period) is fifteen \ndays. There are three days of using precaution (i.e. above and \nbeyond) her normal maximum. (i.e. if she normally menstruates \nfive days and then menstruates after that and it does not stop \nafter the full five days, she adds three days to it. If it does not stop \nafter that, it is false menstruation.  \n \nBut if her normal period is 15 days, she does not use precaution at \nall. This is as long as it does not exceed half a month. (If it is 14, \nshe uses one, and if 13, she uses 2.) Then she is pure (to fast, pray \nand have intercourse even if the blood is flowing, because it is \nfalse menstruation and not menstruation.)  \n \nThe maximum length of menstruation of a pregnant woman after \nthree months (up until five months) is half a month and five days \n(i.e. twenty days). When she starts the sixth month, it is twenty \ndays and the like (i.e. ten with the twenty and so the maximum is \nthirty days). Is the judgment of the woman whose has a period \nbefore three months the same as the judgment of a woman whose \nperiod comes after it  (after three months), or is she like the one \nwith a regular period? There are two statements. If purity is \nstopped by blood before it is completely finished, even by a hour, \nshe adds only the days of bleeding (i.e. rather than the days it \nstopped, and it cancels it when it is less than half a month. There \nmust be 15 twenty-four days of continuous purity free of blood by \nagreement.  \n \nThen, after patches and continuous blood, it is false menstruation, \nnot menstruation. So she does ghusl for the end of menstruation. \nThe one who has bleeding patches does the ghusl whenever the \nblood stops in the patched days unless she thinks that the blood \nwill return before the time she is in finishes. In such a case she is \nnot commanded to do ghusl. She fasts (if it stops at Fajr or before) \nand prays and has intercourse after ghusl according to the known \nposition as opposed to the author of the Irshad who says that \nintercourse is not permitted. She can pray in all the days of \nmenstruation when the period comes to her at night and then \nstops before Fajr. So she might not miss a prayer or a fast.  \n \nBlood which is distinct (from false menstrual blood by the change \nof smell, color or fineness or thickness) after (the full 15 days of) \npurity is menstruation (and prevents prayer and the like). If it is \nnot distinct from false menstruation in any way, it is false \nmenstruation, even if it goes on a long time. It is like that for what \nis distinct before the end of purity. One does not pay attention to \nthe distinction. If the blood is distinct from the blood of false \nmenstruation by anything above and is judged to be menstruation \nand it continues until her normal time is complete and more, is \nchanges from the quality of the blood of menstruation to that of \nfalse menstruation. So she does not use caution beyond her \nnormal days, but does ghusl by the simple completion of her \nnormal days according to the soundest version (from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi).)  \n \nPurity from menstruation is known by the dryness (of the private \nparts) from blood, yellowness and brownness when she inserts a \nbit of cotton, for instance, and brings it out without seeing \nanything on it. Or it is by a white liquid which issues from the \nprivate parts after the end of menstruation. This liquid is more \nconclusive of the end of menstruation than dryness for the one \nwho usually has it. If she sees the liquid before dryness, it is \nrecommended that she do ghusl at the end of the preferred time \n(for the prayer). There is some discussion about the sign of purity \nof the one whose has her first period. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that she is only pure by dryness which she sees, even \nif the time for the prayer goes by.  \n \nThe woman with a period does not have to look for her purity \nbefore Fajr. (Indeed, it is disliked because it is not something \nwhich the Salaf did.) She should look when she goes to sleep to see \nwhether she can catch Maghrib and Isha' and fast. She should \nlook at the beginning of Subh and the other five prayers (allowing \ntime for ghusl).  \n \nMenstruation prevents the validity of prayer and fasting and their \nobligation and divorce (which is prohibited, but is binding if it \ntakes place.) It prevents the start of idda, which begins with \npurity. It prevents intercourse or touching under the waist-\nwrapper (from the waist to knees), even after the end of the period \nbefore the ghusl. Tayammum makes the prayer permitted, but \ndoes not remove the impurity. It prevents entering the masjid, so \nthere is no itikaf or tawaf. It prevents touching a copy of the Holy \nQur'an (except for a teacher or student who has a dispensation) \nand recitation.  \n \n2.2g Incontinence of Urine  \n \nThis is also the case for incontinence (salas) of urine. \n  \nIt is recommended for someone with incontinence to do wudu' for \nevery prayer and for his wudu' to be directly before the prayer. \nThere is no special judgment for incontinence of urine. It is a \ngeneral judgment for everyone with some form of incontinence, be \nit urine, wind, or maniyy. All are the same in that they do not \nbreak wudu' by what emerges from them and are constant, even if \nit is only half the time when he is unable to remove it by medical \ntreatment or marriage. If someone is able to stop it, then it breaks \nhis wudu', he is excused for the period of treatment in that it does \nnot break it.  \n \n2.2h Loss of Consciousness: deep sleep  \n \nYou have to do wudu' after loss of consciousness caused by \ndeep sleep,  \n \nLoss of consciousness is one of the reasons which lead to ritual \nimpurity and obliges wudu' after it passes. The loss of intellect is \nwhen it is completely absent. When it departs completely, as in \nsleep or fainting, and then is restored to him, the judgment is that \nwudu' is obligatory. A deep sleep, whether long or short, breaks \nwudu' absolutely. A deep sleep that in which the sleeper is not \naware of what he or someone else does. What is understood from \nthe word \"deep\" is that the dozing in which the person is aware of \nthe slightest thing definitely does not break wudu', be that short \nor long based on what is in Sahih Muslim, \"The Companions of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to sleep and then pray \nwithout doing wudu'.\" Nonetheless, it is recommended to do wudu' \nafter a long light sleep.   \n \n2.2i Fainting  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that someone who faints \nhas to do wudu'. Fainting is an illness in the head.  \n \n2.2j Drunkenness or intoxication  \n \nThe one who loses his senses through drunkenness must do wudu'. \nIt makes no difference whether he becomes intoxicated by \nsomething lawful or unlawful, as when he drinks milk thinking \nthat it is not intoxicating and it intoxicates him. \n \n2.2k Insanity or a bout of madness.  \n \nThis even more clearly breaks wudu' because it removes the \nsenses. It is not in itself a reason for it. Wudu' is obliged on \naccount of insanity, intoxication and fainting because it is obliged \nby sleep which is less severe than it because it removes a little \nawareness, and these cause that loss of intellect even more so and \nso it is more likely that it be obligatory on account of them. That is \nwhy there is no difference between long or short, deep or light. \nThey judge that legal responsibility is removed with them which is \nnot the case with sleep. The sleeper is responsible, even if he \nincurs no wrong action. This discussion concerns a bout of \nmadness which ends. The one for whom insanity is complete and \nwithout end owes nothing.  \n \n2.2l Wudu' on account touching a person  \n \nWudu' is also necessary when you touch someone to gain \nsexual pleasure or have bodily contact with them for the \nsame reason  \n \nOne of the causes which results in ritual impurity is touching \nwhich is less than intercourse as the Companions, Tabi‟un, Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and his companions have explained it. \nThe Almighty says, \"Or if you have touched women.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n4:43) 'Ali (radhi’Allahu anhu)  and Ibn 'Abbas (radhi’Allahu \nanhu), however, explain this 'touching' as referring to intercourse, \nand say that His words \"Or you have touched women\" means to \nhave intercourse with them.  \n \nSpecifying 'pleasure' tells us that if the one who touches intends \npleasure, he must do wudu' simply by touching whether or not \nthere is pleasure. So that is even more so if he touches and \nexperiences it. If he did not intend pleasure, but intended to touch \nto find out whether the body was hard or not, and then \nexperiences pleasure, he must do wudu' because of the existence of \npleasure, even though it did not come from intention. So the \nobligation of wudu' hinges on intention, even if there was no \nfeeling while touching. If the feeling occurs after touching, then it \nis like pleasure arising from thinking for which nothing is obliged. \nIf he does not intend pleasure and does not feel it, he does not \nhave to do anything. This is the judgment for touching.  \n \nAs for anyone who is touched, if they are adult and experience \npleasure, they must do wudu'. Otherwise, they do not have to do \nanything if they did not intend pleasure. Otherwise the judgment \nregarding the person who is touched is the same as the one who \ntouches.  \n \n2.2m Wudu' on account of kissing  \n \nor for kissing them for sexual pleasure.  \n \nIt is clear from his words that kissing is general, whether on the \nmouth or elsewhere with the intention or arousal. That is not the \ncase. The accepted position is that the kiss on the mouth generally \nbreaks wudu' whether or not there is intention and arousal \nbecause it is a probable cause of pleasure unless other places give \nrise to pleasure. [Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if \nit is to bid farewell or out of mercy, as when there is some \nmisfortune, it does not break wudu'.] Looking at someone, even \nwith pleasure, does not break wudu'.  \n \n2.2n Touching the Human genitals  \n \nA man must do wudu' if he touches his penis.  \n \nOne of the things which lead to ritual impurity is touching the \npenis because it says in the Muwatta' and elsewhere that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When one of you touches his \npenis, he should do wudu'.\" The touching referred to is with the \npalm or the inside or sides of the fingers. He only mentioned \ntouching one's own penis. As for the penis of someone else, it \nfollows the judgment regarding touching with respect to intention \nor arousal. The penis must be connected to the body. As for that \nwhich is separate from the body, it does not break wudu' when it \nis touched.  \n \nWhen dealing with the eunuch, one considers the shape or lack of \nit. If there is a shape, then touching it breaks wudu. If it does not \nhave a shape, then one takes into consideration the judgment \ngiven to it. If masculinity is adjudged for him, it breaks wudu' and \notherwise it does not.  \n \nThere are different considerations regarding touching it through a \nbarrier. If it is thick, that does not break wudu' in one position, If \nit is light, then the most accepted position is that it does break it. \nTouching the anus or the testicles does not break wudu' in the \naccepted position.  \n \n2.2o A woman touching her vagina  \n \nBut there is difference of opinion about whether a woman \nhas to do wudu' if she touches her vagina.  \n \nThe position of the Mudawwana is that it does not break wudu' \nbased on what is on the hadith, \"When one of you touches his \npenis, he should do wudu'.\" The position is based on the fact that \nthat is what is understood by the word and when something is \nunderstood, a concealed meaning is not considered. The one who \nsays that it does break wudu' bases it on the hadith which says, \"If \nsomeone's hand touches his private parts he should do wudu'\" \nbecause 'private parts' and can be applied to the penis or the \nvagina. Some of them say that wudu' is not broken it if she \ntouches the outside of it, but it is broken if she presses it or puts \nher hand inside the labia.  \n \n2.2p Further Note  \n \nShaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi alaihi): Things that break wudu' \nin other schools, but not in the Maliki school are: vomiting, \nbelching, nosebleeds or other bleeding, cupping, the emission of \npus, laughing in the prayer [Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi)], eating camel meat, eating cooked food, carrying the dead \nperson, slaughtering animals. None of these break wudu'. \n  \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): It is recommended to wash \nout the mouth after eating meat or drinking milk.  \n \n2.3 Ghusl (Full Ablution)  \n \n2.3a Ghusl because of emission of sperm  \n \nYou have to do ghusl when, as has already been mentioned, \nsperm (maniyy) is ejaculated accompanied by sexual \npleasure either during sleep or when awake whether from \na man or woman.  \n \nOne of the things which oblige ghusl is the emission of sperm with \nnormal pleasure, whether while asleep or awake, or man or \nwoman. It is not a precondition for the obligation of ghusl that it \nemerge with pleasure when it actually takes place. Ghusl is \nobliged simply by its emerging after pleasure has departed, as \nwhen he has pleasure without intercourse and then sperm \nemerges from him after the pleasure is over.  \n \n2.3b At the end of menstruation and lochia  \n \nGhusl is also necessary at the end of bleeding from \nmenstruation. \n  \nIt is more precise to say 'the blood of menstruation' because it is \nmore general than simply saying 'menstrual period' since that \nspecifically designates that which is preceded by purity and \nfollowed by purity. The beginning or end of the blood which \nemerges is not called 'a menstrual period'. In the Shari‟ah, the \nblood of menstruation is that which emerges on its own from the \nvagina which normally does not exceed 15 days and it emerges \nwithout being caused by illness or childbirth. Blood which emerges \nnot by some cause, or which emerges from the anus, or emerges \nfrom a child of seven or a woman of 70, or which exceeds 15 days, \nor which emerges because of illness, or because of childbirth is not \nmenstruation so that its judgments apply to it.  \n \n2.3c False menstruation or menorrhagia  \n \nGhusl is necessary when abnormal bleeding (istihada) \nstops  \n \nThen the sensation of the blood of false menstruation was made a \ncause which obliges ghusl. Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nfinal position was that ghusl was recommended. He first said that \nshe does not have a ghusl. None of the people of the school say \nthat it is obligatory except for Shaikh Al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) if one takes his transmission literally.  \n \n2.3d Lochia  \n \nGhusl is necessary at the end of the period of bleeding \nwhich follows childbirth (nifas).  \n \nLochia is one of the causes which makes ghusl obligatory. Lochia \n(nifas) linguistically means childbirth, whether there is blood with \nit or not. It designates the blood itself which emerges from the \nvagina because of childbirth. In the usage of the people of Shari‟ah \nit designates the blood which emerges from the vagina because of \nchildbirth in a healthy and normal way. The blood which emerges \nfrom other than the vagina is not nifas. That which emerges not \non account of childbirth is not considered nifas. That which does \nnot emerge in a healthy manner is not nifas. That would normally \nbe bleeding which occurs is after the period of nifas, which is 60 \ndays.  \n \n2.3e Penetration of the vagina  \n \nGhusl must also be done if the head of the penis penetrates \nthe vagina even if no ejaculation takes place.  \n \nOne of the things which obliges ghusl is the penetration of the \npenis of the adult into the vagina, even if there is no ejaculation, \nwhether it is human or animal, or into the anus, whether female \nor male, whether or not there is emission, and whether or not \nthere is a covering over it, but that is provided that the barrier is \nlight so that pleasure can be felt with it. As for the thick barrier, \nghusl is not obliged with it unless there is ejaculation. Then there \nis ghusl because of ejaculation, not because of the disappearance \nof the penis. The basis for that is what is in the Muwatta' and \nSahih Muslim from the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam), \"When he sits between her arms and legs and then presses \nher, he is obliged to do ghusl.” This hadith is abrogated by what \nSahih Muslim related from the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam), \"When you are too quick or there is no \nejaculation, there is no ghusl, “and by what was related from his \nwords, \"Water is needed on account of water [semen].\"  \n \n2.4 Legal Consequences of vaginal penetration  \n \n2.4a Ghusl is obligatory  \n \nThis penetration of the vagina by the head of the penis \nnecessitates ghusl .  \n \n2.4b Legal consequences in case of fornication  \n \nIt necessitates the hadd punishment [for zina] and the \npayment of the dowry and gives the married couples the \nstatus of being muhsan and makes a woman who has gone \nthrough a triple divorce halal for her original husband and \ninvalidates hajj and fasting.  \n \nIt obliges the hadd punishment for fornication and obliges the \npayment of the dower in full because the contract on its own \ndemands half of the dower. It accords the married couple the \nstates of being muhsan provided that they are free, Muslim, sane \nand adult.  \n \nIt makes a woman lawful for her prior husband, if he is a free \nman. As for the woman divorced by a slave, it makes her lawful \nwhen he has divorced her twice. However making the divorced \nwoman who has been trebly divorced lawful for her prior husband \nmust involve full penetration. Thus full penetration is not a \nprecondition for requiring ghusl, the hadd punishment and \npayment of the dowry, but full penetration and lack of barrier are \npreconditions for making the couple muhsan and making the \ndivorced woman lawful.  \n \n2.4.c Invalidation of hajj and fasting  \n \nIt invalidates hajj and fasting.  \n \nIt absolutely invalidates hajj, be it obligatory or voluntary, \nintentional or by forgetfulness, when it occurs before standing at \n'Arafa or after it before the Tawaf al-Ifada and stoning the Jamra \nal-Aqaba on the Day of Sacrifice. He continues with his hajj and \nmakes it up the following year. It invalidates fasting, even without \nfull penetration, be it obligatory or voluntary, intentional or by \nforgetfulness. He must make it up and owes kaffarah for the \nobligatory if it is done deliberately. Otherwise there is only \nmaking up, as is the case with doing it deliberately in a voluntary \nfast.  \n \n2.5 Ghusl and menstruation  \n \n2.5a When ghusl is done after menstruation  \n \nA woman does ghusl immediately when she sees the white \nliquid [qassa] which comes at the end of menstruation, or \nwhen she notices dryness, even if she notices this after a \nday or two days or only an hour.  \n \nAs the blood of menstruation is mentioned as one of the causes \nwhich oblige ghusl, he goes on to clarify the sign which indicates \nthat it has ended and that the womb is free of it. He mentioned \nthat it has two signs: a white liquid and dryness. When the \nmenstruating woman sees one of the two signs, then her purity is \nclear and she is adjudged to be pure from that moment and does \nnot wait for the second sign. There is no minimum length of \nmenstruation. Its minimum amount is one spurt. There is no \nmaximum amount of it, but has a maximum in time, which is \nfifteen days.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): Its maximum for someone \nwho is having a first period is half a month [i.e. 15 days. If it stops \nbefore that and then she remains pure for half a month and then \nblood comes, it is a new menstruation.] as half a month is the \nminimum of purity [which is fifteen days and there is no limit to \nits maximum].  \n \nAnd the maximum length of menstruation for someone with \nnormal periods [even if she has only had one period] is fifteen \ndays. There are three days of using precaution [i.e. above and \nbeyond] her normal maximum. [i.e. if she normally menstruates \nfive days and then menstruates after that and it does not stop \nafter the full five days, she adds three days to it. If it does not stop \nafter that, it is false menstruation. But if her normal period is 15 \ndays, she does not use precaution at all.] This is as long as it does \nnot exceed half a month. [If it is 14, she uses one, and if 13, she \nuses 2.] Then she is pure [to fast, pray and have intercourse even \nif the blood is flowing, because it is false menstruation and not \nmenstruation.]  \n \n2.5b Resumed Bleeding  \n \nIf bleeding starts again or if she sees any yellowish \ndischarge, she must stop doing the prayer and then when \nthe bleeding stops again she should do ghusl and start the \nprayer once more.  \n \nIf she sees the sign of purity and the judgment is that she is pure \nimmediately, from the moment she sees purity, and then the blood \nresumes again or there is a yellowish discharge which does not \nhave the color of blood, she stops praying and reckons that she is \nstill menstruating that day and considers all of it to be the same \nperiod. It is one period since it has come before complete purity. \nOr it may stop before the end of her normal period or extend after \nits normal length and before looking for purity or before it was \ncomplete. When the bleeding comes after complete purity or when \nit ended after her normal period and the days of looking for the \nend, then it is not menstruation, but abnormal bleeding, When it \nstops again, then she again does a ghusl and prays, and does not \nwait to see whether more blood comes again. This question \ninvolves the woman whose purity is interspersed with bleeding to \nadd the days together.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): The one who has bleeding \npatches has a ghusl whenever the blood stops in the patched days \nunless she thinks that the blood will return before the time she is \nin finishes. In such a case she is not commanded to do ghusl. She \nfasts (if it stops at Fajr or before) and prays and has intercourse \nafter ghusl according to the known position as opposed to the \nauthor of the Irshad who says that intercourse is not permitted. \nShe can pray in all the days of menstruation when the period \ncomes to her at night and then stops before Fajr. So she might not \nmiss a prayer or a fast.  \n \n2.5c Legal Consideration of Such Gaps  \n \nWhen this situation occurs, it is considered as one \nmenstrual period when reckoning the period of ‘Idda (after \ndivorce or being widowed) or the period of istibra [after \nthe death of a husband].  \n \nThe intermittent blood is considered as the same period of \nbleeding in respect of „Idda and istibra' and so the days of blood \nare added together until they reach that at which its judgment \nnormally ends or other than. If it exceeds that it is abnormal \nbleeding.  \n \n2.5d Consideration of a Long gap  \n \nIf there is a considerable interval between the two periods \nof bleeding, such as eight or ten days, then the second one \nis considered a new menstrual period.  \n \nIf there is not a long gap between the two periods of bleeding, it is \nconsidered as one menstrual period for the purposes of „Idda and \nistibra', but if there is a long interval between them but less than \nthe time of purity, which is eight or ten, even though the accepted \ninterval is 15 days, then the second is a new menstruation, i.e. the \nbeginning of a new one which is counted for purposes of „Idda and \nistibra'.  \n \n2.5e Abnormal Bleeding  \n \nIf menstrual bleeding continues longer than fifteen days, it \nis considered as istihada and the woman should perform a \nghusl, fast, pray and her husband can have sexual \nintercourse with her.  \n \nThis means if the bleeding continues for her, then she waits for \nfifteen days from its beginning because the maximum of \nmenstruation in respect of her is fifteen days. Then she is judged \nto have abnormal bleeding whether the two periods of bleeding are \ndistinct or not. She has a ghusl and prays and fasts. Her husband \ncan come to her. We mention that which has a beginning to \ndistinguish it from that which has no beginning because there are \ncertain points regarding that because it is either what is normal \nfor her varies or it does not. If it is not different and the blood \ncontinues more for her than it normally does, she looks for purity \nfor three days as long as they do not exceed fifteen days. If it \nvaries, she then looks for purity when it is longer than its norm.  \n \n2.6 Lochia  \n \n2.6a Minimum of Lochia  \n \nIf the bleeding after childbirth [nifas] stops soon after the \nbirth, a woman should do ghusl straightway and start \ndoing the prayer.  \n \nIf shortly after childbirth a woman sees the sign which indicates \nthat it is ended with white discharge and dryness, then she \nwashes and prays. \"Soon after birth\" has no minimum limit in \nrelation to time and it has a minimum in relation to what \nemerges, which is one gush.  \n \n2.6b Maximum of Lochia  \n \nHowever, if bleeding continues longer than sixty days, \nthen she does ghusl anyway, the bleeding is considered as \nistihada, and she does the prayer and fasts and her \nhusband can have sexual intercourse with her.  \n \nIf the bleeding continues, she waits for sixty days, which it the \nmaximum of its extent. If it stops after sixty, the matter is clear. If \nshe continues to bleed after sixty, it is abnormal bleeding and she \nhas a ghusl, prays and fasts and her husband can come to her. \n \n \n \nChapter Three: On the Purity of Water, \nClothing and the Place of Prayer and What \nCan Be Worn When Doing the Prayer \n \n \n \nThis chapter clarifies the condition of purity of water, the \nprecondition of purity of clothing, the precondition of the purity of \nthe place and what clothes are permitted in the prayer. \n  \n3.1 Purity of Water \n  \n3.1a Obligation of purity  \n \nWhen you do the prayer you are talking to your Lord. You \nmust therefore prepare yourself for this by doing wudu' or \nghusl if a ghusl is necessary.  \n \nPurity in the Shari‟ah is a legal state which becomes obligatory in \norder to make the prayer permissible. The one who prays speaks \nintimately with his Lord. According to the hadith which Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) relates in the Muwatta, he must \nprepare for the prayer. The text of the Muwatta' is that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) came out to his Companions while \nthey were praying and their voices were raised in the recitation. \nHe said, \"When you pray, you are speaking confidentially to your \nLord. So look to what you confide to Him, and do not say the Holy \nQur'an out loud so that others hear it.\" He must prepare for that \nconversation by having an attentive heart and humility, and must \nstand with respect before Him, seeking His protection. When he \nlacks that, he does not speak to Him and the term \"conversation\" \nis not valid for him. Nonetheless, it is true that he prays and must \nadopt the means for that by being pure of minor and major \nimpurities.  \n \n3.1b Pure Unchanged Water  \n \nThis \nmust \nbe \ndone \nusing \npure \nwater \nwhich \nis \nuncontaminated by any impurity.  \n \nPurification from impurities is achieved by pure water, i.e. that \nwhich is not mixed with what changes any of its three qualities: \ncolor, taste or smell, whether that change in its attributes is due \nto something either pure or impure. Thus if it is changed by rose \nwater, it is not valid to use it for things like wudu' and ghusl.  \n \n3.1c Change in Color of Water by contact with earth  \n \nYou cannot use water whose color has been changed by \nsomething mixed in with it whether that thing is pure or \nimpure unless the change of color has been caused by \nsomething in the earth where the water is from such as \nsalt deposits or mud or similar things.  \n \nIt is a precondition that the water used for things like wudu' and \nghusl has not been changed in its attributes by what is usually \nseparate from it, except for earth with which it is in direct contact \nand to which it clings as when it lies in salty earth, sulfurous \nearth or fetid mud.  \n \n3.1d Rain Water  \n \nAny water coming from the sky or from springs or wells or \nthe sea is all good, pure and purifies impurities.  \n \nThese waters which originate from the sky are all pure in \nthemselves and good for any use whatsoever, whether drinking or \nsuch things or acts of worship, like wudu', ghusl and removing \nimpurities as long as the water remains in its original state and is \nunchanged any anything which is normally separate from it.  \n \n3.1e Change in Color of Water  \n \nIf the color of the water has been changed by something \npure which has got into it, it remains pure but cannot be \nused for purification either in wudu' or ghusl or for \nremoving impurities.  \n \nMeaning that water whose color has been changed with something \npure, like water from pasta, is pure in itself but does not purify \nsomething else, and so it is not used for wudu' or other things like \nghusl.  \n \n3.1f Change of Water through Impurity  \n \nWater that has been changed by something impure getting \ninto it is not pure and cannot be used for purification \npurposes.  \n \nWater which has been changed through impurity, whether in \ncolor, taste or smell, and whether the water is little or a lot, it has \nsubstance or not, is no longer pure or purifying. It is not used \neither for normal things or for acts of worship.  \n \n3.1g A Small Amount of Impurity  \n \nA small amount of impurity makes a small amount of water \nimpure even if there is no change in the water.  \n \nIf an impurity falls into small amount of water, like the water \nprepared for wudu' or ghusl, even if it is something small and the \nimpurity does not change it, it is not permitted to use it. The most \nfamous position is that is pure, but it is disliked to use it when \nother water exists, provided that it has not been altered. If it has \nbeen changed, its purity absolutely no longer exists.   \n \nShaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that if there is a \nlot of water and it is not changed, then it remains pure. There is \nno specific definition of \"a lot\" in the Maliki School.  \n \n3.2 Amount of Water Used  \n \n3.2a Using a Small Amount of Water  \n \nIt is Sunnah to use a small amount of water when washing \nprovided you do it thoroughly. Using an excessive amount \nis extremism and innovation.  \n \nA small amount of water should be used as long as washing is \ndone properly. Pouring while rubbing is recommended, i.e. a \ndesirable aspect in the din. Using a lot of it, pouring it while using \nit is excess, i.e. increase in the din and innovation, i.e. something \ninnovated which is contrary to the Sunnah and the path of the \nSalaf. \n  \n3.2b The amount used by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam)  did wudu' with one \nmudd of water which is equivalent to [1 1/3 ratls] and he \ndid ghusl with one sa'a which is four mudds measuring by \nhis mudd. \n \nHe points out that it is established in the Sunnah that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did wudu' using a mudd, which is \n1 1/3 ratls and he did ghusl with a sa' which is four mudds. So \naltogether it is 5 1/3 ratls. His aim is to inform us of the excellence \nof economy and abandoning profligacy and the amount which was \nenough for the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n3.3 Purity of the Place and Clothing  \n \n3.3a Purity of Place  \n \nIt is obligatory for the place where you are going to do the \nprayer to be pure.  \n \nThe purity of the place where the limbs of the one praying will \ntouch is obligatory for the sake of the prayer, i.e. its purity for the \nsake of the prayer. Purity for other things, like dhikr is \nrecommended.  \n \n3.3b Purity of Clothing  \n \nYour clothing must also be pure. It is said by some that the \nnature of the obligation referred to here is that of an \nabsolute obligation [fard] and by others that it has the \nobligation of a confirmed Sunnah [Sunnah mu’akkada].  \n \nThe purity of the garment of the one praying is obligatory \nprovided it is remembered and he has the ability to achieve that. \nIf someone intentionally prays in an impure garment when he is \nable to remove it, he must always repeat that prayer. If he prays \nin such a state out of forgetfulness or is unable is remove it, he \nrepeats it if it is still within the time of the prayer. The time of \nDhuhr extends until the yellowing of the sky, and Maghrib \nand 'Isha' extend through the entire night. It is said that it is \nSunnah to remove the impurity, and both positions are known and \nacceptable. Based on the position that it is Sunnah, it is repeated \nat the time absolutely, whether that was intentional, or he was \nable to remove it, or out of forgetfulness or ignorance.  \n \n3.3c Places where it is forbidden to pray:  \n \nYou should not do the prayer in the following places:  \n \n3.3c1 Camel places  \n \nin places where camels congregate,  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in places where camels are kept when they \ncome from water, even if it is safe from impurity and even if \nsomething pure is spread out and is prayed on it because the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did not say that the reason was \nimpurity so that it would be negated if it was negated.  \n \n3.3c2 The Middle of the Road  \n \nor in the middle of the road,  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in the middle of the road where you are \nunsure whether the odor of animals and urine will get on you. If \nyou do pray there, it is recommended that you repeat it within the \ntime. When someone prays there because the masjid is too \ncrowded or he spreads something pure and prays on it or he is \ncertain that it is pure, then there is no dislike.  \n \n3.3c3 On top of the Ka'ba  \n \nor on top of the Ka'ba,  \n \nIt is prohibited to pray on top on the Ka'ba, based on the fact that \nit is necessary to face its building. The one who is above it cannot \nface the building. So if he prays an obligatory prayer on top of it, \nhe must always repeat it because what is important is to face it.  \n \n3.3c4 Public Baths  \n \nor in public baths, a place which you are not certain \nwhether it is pure or not.  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in the baths. The reason for the dislike is the \nlikelihood of impurity. If he is certain of its purity, then the dislike \nis negated and the prayer is permitted.  \n \n3.3c5 Rubbish Dumps  \n \nor on a rubbish heap  \n \nIt is disliked to pray at a place where rubbish is thrown since one \nis not safe from impurity. If he is safe from impurity, then it is not \ndisliked.  \n \n3.3c6 Slaughterhouses \n  \nor in a slaughter house,  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in a place where animals are slaughtered if \nhe is not safe from impurity. Otherwise, it is not disliked.  \n \n3.3c7 Graveyards  \n \nor in the graveyards  \n \nWhen the graveyard is a Muslim one, and there are no disinterred \nparts of the dead in the place of prayer, then it is permitted to \npray there. If there are any parts of those buried in the place of \nprayer, then the judgment of the prayer there depends on the \ndisagreement about and whether the human being becomes \nimpure by death or not. If the dead person is not impure, and the \nperson prays there deliberately, then it is disliked to pray there \nsince there is uncertainty or certainty that there are parts of the \ndead person which would involve humiliation or walking on the \ngrave. As for the prayer, it is not disliked in itself.  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked praying in the \ngraveyards of the unbelievers because they are pits of the Fire, \nbut if someone prays in them and is safe from impurity, his prayer \nis not invalid, even if he is not actually safe from praying on \nimpurity.  \n \n3.3c8 Non-Muslim places of worship  \n \nand places of worship of non-Muslims.  \n \nThis designates churches, synagogues and fire temples of the \nMagians. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked praying in \nthem because of impurity from their feet, i.e. that is the custom in \nthem. The dislike is inasmuch as he prays in it by choice, not \nwhen is compelled to that. Otherwise there is no dislike. There is \nno difference between the ruined or inhabited place.  \n \n3.3d Minimum Clothing in the Prayer for a man  \n \nThe least clothing a man can do the prayer in is something \nwhich covers his 'awra (everything between his navel and \nhis knees) such as a long shirt or a piece of cloth he can \nwrap round him.  \n \nThis minimum of what does not involve sin and is adequate for \nwhat is desired of the one who prays is a garment is that which \ncovers the private parts, be it a long shirt, cloak or trousers. A \nprecondition for the cloak is that it is thick and not thin or \ntransparent, i.e. the private parts should not be outlined or \nencompassed. If it is like that, it is disliked as long as the \ndefinition is not due to wind. Otherwise not. If it is transparent, \nthen sometimes the private parts might appear through it without \nthinking about and then the prayer would be invalid. Sometimes \nit only appears by thinking about it, and it is judgment is like the \nperson whose is doing something disliked and the prayer is valid.  \n \n3.3e Uncovered shoulders  \n \nHowever, it is disliked to do the prayer wearing something \nthat does not cover the shoulders, but if this does happen \nthe prayer need not be repeated.  \n \nIt is disliked for a man to pray in a garment which leaves his \nshoulders completely uncovered when something else is available. \nIf he prays and his shoulder-blades show when he is able to cover \nthem, he does not have to repeat the prayer either in the time or \nafter it.  \n \n3.4 Women's Dress and Prostration  \n \n3.4a A Woman's minimum dress  \n \nThe least clothing a woman can do the prayer in is a thick \nfull-length garment covering her whole body including the \ntop of the feet and something covering her head.  \n \nThe minimum of adequate clothing for a free adult women in the \nprayer consists of two things: one is a thick or ample full-length \ngarment which does not define the figure nor is transparent. This \nis either hasif, which means thick, or khasif, which a full complete \ncovering which covers the top of the feet. It also means what does \nnot define figure nor is transparent because what he means by the \nminimum is that the prayer is that with which the prayer does not \nhave to repeated in the time or outside of it.  \n \nThe second item is a head-covering which covers her hair and her \nneck. Part of its precondition is that it is thick. In short, the fiqh is \nit is obliged for a woman to cover all her body in the prayer, even \nthe soles of her feet based on the statement of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), \"It is not permitted for a woman to show \nanything in the prayer except her face and palms.\"  \n \n3.4b A woman's prostration  \n \nA woman should touch the ground with the palms of her \nhands in sujud just as a man does.  \n \nThe woman touches the earth with her palms in prostration. It is \nmentioned here because it might be imagined from his words \nabout covering the top and soles of her feet that she covers her \npalms because each of them are part of the person who prays who \nis obliged to cover the entire body. Therefore this idea which is \nmentioned here must be eliminated.  \n \n \n \nChapter Four: On How to do Wudu' and what \nis Fard and Sunnah in it – How to Clean \nYourself after Going to the Lavatory with \nWater [Istinja'] or with Stones and Other \nThings [Istijmar] \n \n \n4.1 Istinja' [Cleansing with water in the lavatory]  \n \nIstinja' is to wash the place of filth with water, derived from naja, \nto rescue, meaning to cut. It is as if the one who does istinja' \nremoves something offensive from himself. Istijmar is to use small \nstones to remove offensive matter on the place.  \n \n4.1a Not part of wudu'  \n \nCleaning yourself with water after going to the lavatory \nshould not be considered a part of wudu', being neither \none of its Sunnah nor its fard aspects.  \n \nIt is neither obligatory, Sunnah or recommended to connect wudu' \nto istinja'. It is a separate form of worship which is distinct from \nwudu' in time and place. It is not considered one of the sunan nor \none of the obligations nor one of the merits of wudu'. Its aim is to \nclean the place in particular. It is recommended that it precede \nwudu'. If he delays it, then he must be careful about touching his \npenis which would break his wudu'.   \n \n4.1b Its Purpose \n  \nHowever, you have to do it in order that all impurities are \nremoved before doing the prayer. You do not have to make \na special intention before doing it.  \n \nIstinja' is to remove impurity and so it is obligatory that it be done \nwith water, as istijmar is done with stones so that he does not \npray with impurity on the body. Part of what indicates that it is \npart of removing impurity is that it is enough that he remove it \nwithout intention.  \n \n4.1c Impurity on Clothes  \n \nThe same thing applies when washing impurities off \nclothes.  \n \nCleaning impurity from clothes does not require an intention.  \n \n4.1d Description of Istinja'  \n \nThe way you wash yourself after going to the lavatory \n(istinja') is first of all to wash your hand and then the end \nof the penis where the urine comes out. You then wipe any \nimpurity from your anus using hard earth or other things \nor your left hand, which you should then wipe on the \nground and wash.  \n \nThe full description of istinja' is that after he has removed \nanything by lightly using his fingers, he takes his penis in his left \nhand with his index finger and thumb and then lightly pulls it \nfrom the bottom to the glans. Then he wipes any impurity from his \nanus with clods or anything which can be used for istijmar. Then \nhe washes his left hand fearing that any unpleasant smell will \nremain on it. Then he does istinja' with water, but he first washes \nthe place of urine before the place of feces so that his hand will not \nbe impure. Combining istijmar and istinja' with water is better \nsince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that.  \n \n4.1e Further Cleaning  \n \nAfter this you wash your anus by pouring water over it \nwhich you continue to do while at the same time relaxing \nit a little, rubbing the area thoroughly with the left hand \nuntil it is clean.  \n \nYou continue to pour water without letting up because it is more \nhelpful in removing filth. You relax the anus a little because there \nare folds in it. When water touches it, it contracts. When it is \nrelaxed, it can be washed. The place is rubbed with the hand while \nthe water is being poured until it is cleaned of noxiousness. It is \nenough that he thinks it probable if he is able to do that. If he is \nnot able to do it because his hand is cut off or short, he delegates \nsomeone who is able to touch that place, be it wife or slavegirl. He \ndoes not do wudu' when he leaves that without washing it.  \n \n4.1f What is unnecessary  \n \nYou do not have to wash the inside of either of the two \nopenings.  \n \nIt is not recommended or Sunnah to wash inside the openings. For \na man, there is only one opening, because the urethra has no \nopening.  \n \n4.1g In case of breaking wind  \n \nYou should not do istinja' on account having broken wind.  \n \nIt is forbidden to do this cleansing on account of wind. The basis \nfor that is the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam),\"The one who does istinja' on account of wind is not one of \nus.\" There is no text which clarifies whether the prohibition is one \nof prohibition or one of dislike. The hadith can imply either.  \n \n4.2 Istijmar [Cleansing with stones]  \n \n4.2a Number of stones  \n \nWhen doing istijmar it is sufficient to use only three stones \nprovided that the last one comes out clean,  \n \nIstijmar is done with three stones. When the last one comes out \nclear of noxiousness, then that is adequate, even if water is \navailable. One might conclude from his words that istijmar using \nless than three stones is not permissible. But the well-known \nposition is that it is based on cleanness, even if it that is achieved \nwith only one stone.  \n \nShaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi alaihi) points out that it should \nbe an odd number.  \n \n4.2b Water is better  \n \nbut using water is more purifying, pleasanter and \npreferred by the men of knowledge ['ulama'].  \n \nIt is understood from his words that the stones are enough, even if \nwater exists, out of the fear that someone might imagine that that \nis the same as using water and that they are equally excellent. \nThat possibility is eliminated by his words that water is \"more \npurifying\" because neither substance nor trace remains when it is \nused while the stone only removes the actual thing, and water is \nbetter because it removes doubt. It is preferred by scholars, with \nthe exception of Shaikh ibn al-Musayyab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwho said that using water is the action of women and implies that \nit is part of their obligation, i.e. specific to them and they are not \nallowed to use stones, as it is specifically necessary in \nmenstruation, lochia and sperm, i.e. in respect of the one obliged \nto do tayammum because of illness or when he does not have \nenough water for ghusl, but does have enough water to remove the \nimpurity. Water is also specifically necessary when a lot spreads \nout from the orifice when it is more than is customary.  \n \n4.3 Washing the hands before wudu'  \n \nIf someone has neither urinated nor defecated but is doing \nwudu' because he has broken it in some other way or has \nbeen asleep or done something else which makes it \nnecessary for him to do wudu' he should wash his hands \nbefore he puts them into whatever water container he is \nusing.  \n \nIf someone has not urinated nor defecated or anything else which \nwould require istinja', like madhy and Wady, and wants to do \nwudu' because he has broken wind or done something else which \nobliges wudu', like apostasy, uncertainty about impurity, \nbecoming a Rafidite [extreme Shi'ite], and other reasons like sleep, \nintoxication and unconsciousness, in following the Sunnah, he \nmust wash his hands first even if there is nothing on them which \ndemands washing them as when they are both clean. Washing the \nhands must absolutely be done whether he does istinja' or \nanything else.  \n \n4.4 Sunnah’s and obligations of Wudu'  \n \n4.4aWashing the hands to the Wrists  \n \nThe Sunnah’s of wudu' include: washing the hands before \nputting them into the water container,  \n \nOne of the Sunnah‟s of wudu' is to wash the hands to the wrists \nbefore putting them in the vessel. The Sunnah of washing the \nhands before putting them into the vessel is when there is little \nwater and it is possible that it might be used up. Otherwise it is \nnot Sunnah to wash them before putting them in the vessel.  \n \n4.4b Rinsing the mouth  \n \nrinsing the mouth,  \n \nRinsing the mouth is a Sunnah: it is to move water about in the \nmouth and spit it out. If he swallows it, it is not the Sunnah. Also \nif he opens his mouth so the water runs into it, it is not the \nSunnah. The water must be moved about in the mouth and then \nspat out.  \n \n4.4c Sniffing up water  \n \nsniffing up water into the nose and blowing it out again,  \n \nOne of the Sunnah‟s is to put water in the nostril by inhaling and \nif water is put up the nose without sniffing, that is not the \nSunnah. To blow it out, he puts his forefinger and thumb of his \nleft on his nose and blows out the water from the nostrils using his \nbreath.  \n \n4.4d Wiping the ears  \n \nand wiping the ears. These are all Sunnah actions,  \n \nIt is a Sunnah of wudu' to wipe the outside and inside of the ears. \nThe outside is what is next to the head and the inside is what is \nbeside the face.  \n \n4.5 Obligatory Elements of Wudu'  \n \nthe rest being obligatory [fard].  \n \nThe rest of wudu' is obligatory. This sentence is unclear since the \nrest of wudu' includes aspects which are Sunnah, like repeating \nthe wiping of the head, renewing the water for the ears, and the \ncorrect sequence, and that which is recommended, like saying the \nbasmala at the beginning. The answer to that is that his words, \n'the rest being obligatory' means the rest of the limbs which are \nwashed and wiped independently since it is obligatory to wipe the \nhead, and repeating it is dependent on it. The rest of the limbs \ndesignates independent obligations. Renewing the water and the \ncorrect sequence are not limbs. They are not connected to limbs, \nbut to other than limbs because renewal is connected to water and \nproper sequence is connected to washing.  \n \n4.6 How to do wudu'  \n \n4.6a Basmala  \n \nSome of the men of knowledge ['ulama'] say that when you \ngo to do wudu' because you have been asleep or for any \nother reason you should begin by saying \"bismillah\" [in the \nname of Allah], whereas others say that this is not part of \ndoing wudu' correctly.  \n \nWhen you go to do wudu' for some reason which obliges it, like \nsleep or something else, some scholars says that one begins with \nthe basmala. It is said that he says, \"In the name of Allah, the \nMerciful, the Compassionate,\" and it is said that he simply says, \n\"Bismillah.\" Some scholars do not think that beginning with the \nbasmala was part of the known business of the Salaf, and indeed \nthink that it is reprehensible, i.e. disliked.  \n \nIt is evident from the words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwhen he ascribes each position to 'some' that Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did not take any stand regarding the \nbasmala. There are three transmissions from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) about the basmala. One is that it is \nrecommended, and that is what was stated by Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and is well-known because of the words of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"There is no wudu' for \nthe one who does not mention Allah.\" The hadith appears to imply \nthe obligation, and that is what was said by Imam Ahmad \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nShaikh \nIshaq \nibn \nRahawayh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), who was a mujtahid. The second is that it is \nreprehensible, saying, \"Is he slaughtering so that he needs to say \nthe basmala?\" The third is that there is a choice and then the \njudgment is that it is permitted.  \n \n4.6b Where to place the water vessel  \n \nIt is easier to get at the water if the container is on your \nright hand side.  \n \nIt is recommended for the person doing wudu' to put the vessel \nfrom which he does wudu' to his right because it is easier to take \nwater. If the vessel is open, he can scoop from it. If the opening is \nnarrow, it is better to have it on his left because that is easier.  \n \n4.6c Washing the hands three times  \n \nYou begin by washing your hands three times before \nputting them into the water container,  \n \nAfter putting the open vessel to the right and the narrow one to \nthe left, to follow the Sunnah, he begins by washing his hands to \nthe wrists three times before putting them into the vessel with a \nseparate intention.  \n \n4.6d If you have gone to the lavatory  \n \nexcept if you have just urinated or defecated in which case \nyou wash off any traces of impurity before starting to do \nwudu'.  \n \nWhat precedes is about the one who has not urinated or defecated. \nIf he has urinated or defecated, then that person washes off the \nurine or feces from himself before doing wudu'. Then he does \nwudu', meaning the linguistic washing of the hands. Thus his first \nwords about washing the hands before putting them in the vessel \nis about the one who has not urinated or defecated. If he has \nurinated or defecated, then he washes the place of urine or other \nfilth and then does wudu', i.e., washes his hands, which is the first \nof the Sunnah‟s of wudu'.  \n \n4.6f Rinsing the Mouth  \n \nYou put your hand into the container, take some water, \nand rinse your mouth out three times, using either one \nhandful or three as you wish.  \n \nYou put your hand in the vessel if it is possible. Otherwise you \npour the water and take enough water without being extravagant. \nYou can rinse the mouth three times using one handful of water. \nThe first handful is Sunnah and each of the remaining two is \nrecommended. If he wishes, he rinses the mouth three times with \nthree handfuls, and the second form is better than the first form.  \n \n4.6g Rubbing the Teeth  \n \nIt is also good to rub your teeth with your finger.  \n \nIt is recommended to clean the teeth with the finger before doing \nwudu'.  \n \n4.6h Sniffing Water up the Nose  \n \nYou then sniff up water into your nose \n \nFor the correct sequence only, so after he has rinsed the mouth, he \nsniffs water up his nose. Note that he says, \"into the nose\" because \nthere might be sniffing without in going into the nose. Perhaps he \nmentioned that to seek the blessing of the actual words of the \nhadith. Sahih Muslim says, \"He snuffs water up his nose.\"  \n \n4.6i Blowing water out the nose  \n \nand blow it out again three times, holding your nose as you \ndo when you blow it.  \n \nWhat is accepted is that it is Sunnah on its own, and the \ndescription of blowing out is to put the finger and thumb of the left \nhand on the nose and to bring the water with the air of the nose as \nhe does when he blows the nose. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) disliked blowing it like a donkey because of the prohibition \nagainst that in the hadith.  \n \n4.6j Number of Times  \n \nIt is all right if you do this rinsing and sniffing less than \nthree times. It is also all right to do all of this with only one \nhandful of water but three handfuls is preferable.  \n \nLess than three is adequate for rinsing and sniffing. The \nminimum is achieved by one or two times. The evidence for what \nhe mentioned is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nwudu' doing each action once and each action twice. The person \ndoing wudu' can also combine rinsing and sniffing in the same \nhandful. It has two forms. One is that he only moves to sniffing \nafter he finishes rinsing and the second is that he rinses and sniffs \nand then rinses and sniffs and then rinses and sniffs. The first is \nbetter because it is free of any reversal of order in worship.  \n \n4.6k Washing the Face: Wetting the Face  \n \nThen you take water, either with both hands together or \nwith \nthe \nright \nhand \nbringing \nthe \nhands \ntogether \nafterwards, and using both hands pour the water onto the \nface.  \n \nAfter finishing rinsing the mouth and sniffing, then he takes \nwater with both hands if he wishes, or with the right hand and \nthen puts it onto both hands and brings the water to his face. It \nappears that moving the water to the face is a precondition. This \nis according to Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn \nMajishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). The well-known position is that it is not a precondition to \nmove it. What is desired is to bring water to the surface of the face \nhowever that happens, even by a water-spout.  \n \n4.6l Actual Washing of the Face  \n \nThen using both hands you wash the face  \n \nHe applies water to the face without splashing the face with water \nas women and most men do it. He washes it with the hands. This \nmeans that washing connected to moving the water to the washed \nlimb is a precondition of the recommendation in wudu'. He also \ndoes that himself, even if he entrusts someone else to do the wudu' \nwhen that is not necessary. It does not satisfy the requirement \nbecause that is one of the actions of the arrogant. Rubbing is also \nobligatory, and the well-known position is that rubbing is \nobligatory in itself, not simply bringing the water to the face.  \n \n4.6m Area covered: Top of forehead  \n \nfrom the top of the forehead - which is marked by the \nhairline -  \n \nThe Sunnah in washing is to begin to wash the limbs from their \ntop. If he begins from the bottom, it is allowed, but what he has \ndone is disliked. He explains that what is meant by forehead is \nwhat touches the earth in prostration and the right and left sides \nof the brow, which is next to the normal roots of the hair. One does \nnot take into consideration thick hair or baldness. He includes the \nthick hair in washing but not the place of baldness. From 'hairline' \nit is understood that part of the head must be washed to achieve \nthe obligation.  \n \n4.6n End of the chin  \n \nto the end of the chin,  \n \nThe face has both length and width. The beginning of its length is \nthe normal roots of the hair and the end is to the end of the chin, \nwhich is point of the beard, and the hairs on the bottom lip. There \nis no dispute about it being included in the washing. Its width is \nfrom ear to ear.  \n \n4.6o Covering the entire face  \n \ncovering the whole area of the face from the jawbones to \nwhere the ears start, making sure you include the eye \nsockets, any wrinkles on the forehead and the bottom of \nthe nose.  \n \nHe must wash the entire face, rubbing around it, including the \ntemples between the ears and the eyes. The well-known position is \nthat it is included in washing. You run your hand over what is \nhidden inside the sockets and inside the eyes. That must be \nwashed. Also the hand must pass over the wrinkles on the brow, \nwhich is the place of prostration The hand must be passed over \nthe bottom of the nostrils. This refers to the outside out and not \nthe inside. He must wash the outside of his lips if they are not \ncovered while washing the face.  \n \n \n4.6p Doing it three times  \n \nYou wash your face in this way three times taking water to \nit.  \n \nThe face is washed in this manner three times from the beginning \nof the limb to the end and rubbing it.  \n \n4.6q The Beard  \n \nWhen washing your face you rub the beard with both \npalms to make sure that water gets into it since hair has a \nnatural tendency to repel water. You do not have to put \nyour fingers through your beard when doing wudu' \naccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). You merely \nrub your hands over your beard down to the end.  \n \nWhen the beard is thick, when washing the face, rub the hair of \nthe thick beard with the palms in order to make the water enter \nit. If he does not do this, he will not do all of the outside of the hair \nbecause the hair repels water which gets on it unless it is moved \nby the hands. The well-known position from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that one does not have to put your fingers \nthrough the hair of a thick beard when doing wudu'. Indeed the \napparent text of the Mudawwana is that it is disliked in the case \nof a thick beard. As for the sparse beard through which the skin \nshows, he must put his fingers through it when doing wudu'. It is \nobligatory to absolutely to do this to make water penetrate the \nhair of the thin or thick beard in washing. The hands must move \nthe water to the end of the beard.  \n \n4.6r The Second Obligation: the Hands  \n \nYou then wash your right hand and forearm three times, or \ntwice, pouring water over it and rubbing it with the left \nhand, making the fingers of one hand go between the \nfingers of the other. Then you wash the left hand and \nforearm in the same way.  \n \nThen first after finishing washing the face, which is the first \nobligation, he moves on to the second obligation, which is the \nhands. He washes the right hand first because it is recommended \nwithout dispute to begin with the right in things before the left \nsince it is sound that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"When you do wudu' begin with the right.\" It is done three or \ntwo times. There is a choice in the number times the hands are \nwashed, but there is no choice in washing the face and feet. The \nreason for that is that it is established that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) washed his face three times and his hands \ntwice each.  \n \nHe pours water on the right hand and rubs it with the left hand. \nThe rubbing must be connected to pouring the water. He puts the \nfingers of one hand between those of the other hand. He inserts \nthem through the gaps from the top and not the bottom because \notherwise that would entail entwining which is disliked. His \nwords can imply either obligation or recommendation, but the first \nis the well-known position. The basis for that is the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"When you do wudu', put \nwater between your fingers and your toes.\" However, the \ncommand is obligatory for the hands and recommended for the \nfeet. Then he washes the left hand in the same manner.  \n \n4.6s Extent of Washing the Hands and Arms  \n \nWhen washing the arms you go right up to the elbow, \nincluding it in what you wash. It has also been said that \nyou only wash up to the elbows and that it is not necessary \nto include them but it is better to include them in order to \nremain on the safe side.  \n \nWhen doing wudu' you wash up to the elbows and include the \nelbows in the washing. It is possible to include them or not in the \nwashing. The most famous position is that it is obligatory to \ninclude them. He clearly stated that here. This is taking the ayat \n(\"and your hands to the elbows,\") to mean \"with\". Those who say \nthat the washing ends at the elbows take the ayat to actually \nmean \" up to\". The third position is that it is recommended to \ninclude them in the washing to remove the difficulty of definition \nbecause it is difficult to define the end which the washing reaches.  \n \n4.6t The Third Obligation: Wiping the Head  \n \nThen you take water with your right hand, pour it onto the \nleft hand and using both hands you wipe over your head, \nbeginning at the hairline at the front of the head. You \nplace fingertips together with the thumbs at the temples \nthen wipe over your head with both hands as far as the \nhairline at the back of the neck. Then you bring them back \nto the place you started, bringing your thumbs up behind \nyour ears back to the temples. Whatever way you wipe \nyour head is acceptable as long as the whole head is \ncovered but the way mentioned is better. If you were to put \nboth hands into the container, then lift them out wet, and \nwipe over your head with them this is also acceptable.  \n \nAfter finishing the second obligation, he moves to the third \nobligation, and takes the water with the right hand and pours it \nonto the left palm and wipes his entire head with his hands. It is \nrecommended to start at the front of the head or the normal \nhairline whether the hair is thick or he is bald. The fingers are put \ntogether except for the thumbs which are put at each of the \ntemples. Then the head is wiped to the back of the neck, which is \nthe bottom of the skull and then it is brought back to the place \nfrom where you started. It is recommended to bring the thumbs \nbehind the ears and back to the temples which must be wiped \nalong with the rest of the face including the hair. This manner of \nwiping is not obligatory, but the basis is to achieve a \ncomprehensive washing and to completely wipe the head and hair.  \n \nIf he put his hands in the vessel, that is another way of taking \nwater for wiping the head. So if he brings his hands out wet after \nputting them in the water, whether it is in a vessel or not and \nthen wipes his head, that is enough according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) without dislike and it is recommended \naccording to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n4.6u The Ears  \n \nThen you pour water over your index fingers and thumbs \nor if you like you dip them into the water and with them \nyou wipe the outside and inside of both ears.  \n \nAfter wiping the head, then the ears are wiped by taking water in \nthe right hand and pouring it over the index finger and thumb of \nthe left hand and the adjoining part of the left palm and he pours \nit on the same of the right hand. Then he wipes the outside and \ninside of both ears. If he wishes, he can dip the index fingers and \nthumbs in the water and then wipe with them. The first manner \ncomes from Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the \nsecond from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n4.6v Women's Action in Wiping  \n \nWomen wipe their heads and ears in the same way but they \nhave to wipe over any hair that is hanging loose and \ncannot wipe over any head covering.  \n \nThe woman wipes her head and ears like the man in amount and \ndescription by the words of the Almighty, \"Wipe your heads,\" and \nwomen are the sisters of men. She wipes over any hair hanging \nloose. What is well-known is the obligation to wipe over any of \nman's hair which is hanging on the two sides since it will fall on \nthe place of the obligation or on the face. As for that which \nactually extends over the place of the obligation, it is agreed that \nit is obligatory to wipe it.  \n \nThe 'head covering' is a cloth by which a woman binds her hair to \nprotect it from the dust. She also does not wipe over other similar \nhair coverings when they are put next to the head because all of \nthat is a barrier since it does not let her wipe what must be wiped. \nOtherwise it is permitted as Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) wiped over his \nturban, which is by necessity. Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ndisagreed and said that there is choice in that. It is affirmed that \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) wiped the forelock at the \nfront of the head first and finished by wiping over the turban.  \n \nWiping under plaits  \n \nThey should put their hands under their plaits when \nbringing their hands back to the front.  \n \nAfter the woman begins the wiping from the front of her head and \nreaches the back where the hair hangs down, she must put her \nhands under the plaits of hair to complete it, and it is Sunnah to \nbring the hands back if there is any moisture left on them. It is \nclear from his words that she does not have to undo her plaits \nbecause of the difficulty involved. Some people limit that to what \nis tied with a thread or two. When there are a lot of threads, it \nmust be undone.  \n \n4.6w Fourth Obligation: the Feet  \n \nAfter he finishes wiping the ears, he begins the fourth obligation, \ni.e. washing the feet. It is said that its obligation is wiping. The \nreason for the disagreement has to do with how the words of the \nAlmighty are read and whether \"your feet\" is in the genitive or \naccusative. If it is accusative, then the feet are added to \"face and \nhands\" and there is no doubt that its obligation is washing, and so \nthis judgment is given by the conjunction. If it is genitive, then it \nis joined to \"head\" and it has the judgment of what it is joined to, \nwhich is wiping, and so they are wiped. They are wiped if he is \nwearing leather socks. This is deduced from what the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did since it is confirmed that he \nonly wiped his feet when he was wearing leather socks. The \nmultiple transmissions from him (alaihi salat wa salam) is that he \nalways washed them when he was not wearing leather socks.  \n \n4.6x The Manner of Washing the Feet  \n \nYou then wash both feet pouring water onto your right foot \nwith your right hand and rubbing it with your left hand \nlittle by little. You do this thoroughly three times.  \n \nThe description of washing the feet is that water is poured with \nthe right hand onto the right foot which is rubbed with the left \nhand. Rubbing one foot with the other is not enough. This is the \nposition of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nIts washing is recommended to be completed by water and \nrubbing three times and should not be more than that. The \nwashing of the feet is limited to three times, which is one of two \nwell-known positions about whether the fourth is disliked or \nforbidden. The other statement is that washing the feet has no \nlimitation. What is desired is to cleanse, even that is more than \nthree. It is also well-known.  \n \n4.6y The Toes and Heels  \n \nIf you want you can put your fingers between your toes. If \nyou do not do this it does not matter, but doing it makes \nyou feel more satisfied. You then rub your heels and ankles \nand any part which water does not get to easily due to \nhardening or cracking of the skin. You should make sure \nyou do this well, pouring water on the area with your hand \nbecause there is a hadith which says, \"Woe to the heels \nfrom the Fire.\" The \"heel\" of a thing is its extremity or end. \nYou then do the same thing with the left foot.  \n \nIf he wishes, he puts water between his toes while washing them, \nand if he wishes, he leaves that, but it is better to put them \nbetween the toes and no doubt remains when it is done.  \n \nRubbing \nthe \nheels \ncan \nmean \neither \nthe \nobligation \nor \nrecommendation. What is meant is the first. He must rub all those \nplaces where the water does not immediately reach due to \nhardness or cracks as well as wrinkles in loose skin. The threat \nregarding \"Woe to the heels from the Fire\" does not only apply to \nheels, but to every part of the limbs of wudu'. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said that about when he saw that the heels \nhad no water on them and had not been wiped with water. The \nwhole process is repeated with the left foot. He (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did not state the limit of washing, and it extends to the \nankles. The best known position is to include them in the washing.  \n \n4.6z Three Times  \n \nWashing each of the limbs three times is not an actual \ncommand. You can do it less but three is the most you \nshould do. If you can do it thoroughly with less than that it \nis acceptable as long as you do not leave anything out. Not \neveryone is the same in the amount of water they require \nto do wudu' thoroughly.  \n \nThere is no actual definition that it is not adequate if the limbs \nare not washed in wudu' three times each. Three is the limit of \nwhat can be done, and no more than three. Shaikh ibn Bashir \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) transmits the consensus that the fourth time \nis forbidden. The story of the consensus of its prohibition is not \nestablished because of the existence of the statement that it is \ndisliked. However prohibition can include what is disliked. The \nbasis in this is that it is related that a bedouin asked the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) about wudu' and he showed him \nthree times each. It is clear that he did wudu' in his presence and \nthen said, \"This is how wudu' is.\" Therefore anyone who does more \nthan this has acted badly, transgressed and done wrong. If it is \ndone thoroughly with less than that, it is allowed. The maximum \nis specified, but not the minimum since it is contained in one and \ntwo and so its state is known and there is no need to define it.  \n \nNot all people are the same in doing that washing thoroughly. If \nsomeone does not do it thoroughly with one time, then it is not \nallowed and specified in respect of him that which will achieve it. \nIf that is only complete with two, then he intends the obligation by \nthem, and the third is excellence. If it is only thorough with three, \nthen the obligation is intended by it and the recommendation \nremoves what is more. It is clear that the description of wudu' \ncontains obligations, Sunnah‟s and virtues and the person is \nencouraged to perform them in the manner by which none of them \nis lacking.  \n \n4.7 The reward for performing wudu'  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), said, \"Anyone who \ndoes wudu' and does it well and then raises his eyes to the \nsky and says, 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah \nalone, without any partner and I bear witness that \nMuhammad is His slave and Messenger,' will have the eight \ngates of the Garden opened for him and he can enter by \nany of them he chooses.\"  \n \n47a What to say afterwards  \n \nSome of the 'ulama' recommend saying when you finish \nwudu', \"O Allah, make me one of those who turn back to \nYou and make me one of those who purify themselves.\"  \n \nALLAHUMMA IJA'ALNI MINA'T-TAWWABIN WA'JA'ALNI \nMINA'L-MUTATAHHIRIN  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is \nrecommended to say this. The 'tawwabin' are those who have \ncommitted wrong actions and then repented and purified \nthemselves of the wrong actions.  \n \n4.8 Purpose of Wudu'  \n \n4.8a Aim  \n \nYou must do wudu' realizing that you are doing it for Allah \nazza wa jall as He has ordered you to do, hoping that it will \nbe accepted and that you will get the reward for it and that \nit will purify you of your wrong actions.  \n \nScholars say that the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not speak \nabout the intention (niyya) for wudu' because he did not say that \nhe makes the intention to perform wudu' which is an obligation by \nagreement with Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) because \nhe did not recall any disagreement about its being obligatory for \nwudu'. That is why the agreement is related about its being \nobligatory and in the soundest position with Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Opposite it there is a text on wudu' from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) about it not being obligatory. \nThen they disagree about whether it can be deduced from his \nwords or not. Some say that he does not speak about intention in \nthe Risala at all and some of that say that it is deduced from his \nwords \"he must\", meaning the person doing wudu' must be doing \nwudu' sincerely for Allah azza wa jall, not for showing off or \nreputation. That is because sincerity is commanded in the words \nof the Almighty, \"They were only commanded to worship Allah \nmaking the din sincerely His.\" Sincerity is that a person intend \nthe Worshipped by the act of worship without actual articulation. \nThe focus of the intention is the heart. Part of its precondition is \nthat it accompany the first obligation in wudu', which is washing \nthe face. If it precedes it by a lot, then it is agreed that it is not \npermissible. There are two accepted positions about it preceding \nby a little. The best known is that it is allowed. They agreed that \nif he makes the intention after washing the face, then it is not \nadequate. The basis for the intention is that it accompany it. If it \nhappens that he overlooks it, he is forgiven.  \n \nWhen wudu' is done sincerely with the intention of obeying Allah \nazza wa jall's command and secure in himself that the action is \ndone freely, he should hope that it will be accepted and he will be \npurified of wrong actions based on what is in Muslim where the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When a Muslim (or a \nbeliever) does wudu' and washes his face, then every wrong action \nat which his eye looked leaves from his face with the water - or \nwith the last drop of water.\"  \n \n4.8b Wudu' as preparation  \n \nYou should feel in yourself that it is a preparation and a \ncleansing for speaking to your Lord and standing in front \nof Him to carry out the acts He has made obligatory on you \nwith humility in your bowing and prostration.  \n \nHe should know that wudu' is a preparation and a cleansing from \nwrong actions and dirt. When the legally responsible person wants \nto perform wudu', he does it sincerely for Allah azza wa jall \ndesiring that Allah azza wa jall will accept it because he is \npurifying himself and this is in order to prepare to converse with \nhis Lord. Conversing with the Lord demands sincerity of heart \nand devotion of inner consciousness to His remembrance. It is also \nin order to perform the obligation Allah azza wa jall has imposed \non him. Bowing and prostration are specifically mentioned as well \nas humility in other actions because total humility is meant and \nbecause the closest a slave is to his Lord is when he is in \nprostration.  \n \n4.8c Having Certainty  \n \nYou should do wudu' with a certainty of this, taking good \ncare to do it properly for no action is complete without the \nright intention behind it.  \n \nYou should be aware that wudu' is preparation for intimate \nconversation with your Lord in order to make reverence and \nesteem firm in your heart. That will result in doing wudu' with \ndue humility to your Master. This reverence and esteem will \nresult in doing wudu' in a manner which is mindful of avoiding \nimperfections and whisperings. Actions are only according to \nintentions. It is enough that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Every man has what he intends.\"  \n \n \n \nChapter Five: Ghusl \n \n \nEvidence for it and its preconditions were already mentioned in \nthe chapter on wudu'. The description of ghusl contains \nobligations, Sunnah‟s and meritorious elements. The author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did not clarify which are the obligations and \nso we will make that clear. There are five obligations:  \n \nCovering the entire body with water;  \n \nthe intention;  \n \nlack of interruption;  \n \nrubbing;  \n \nand making water penetrate the hair, whether it is thick or there \nare thick plaits.  \n \nThere are five Sunnah‟s of ghusl:  \n \nwashing the hands to the wrists first:  \n \nrinsing the mouth;  \n \nsniffing water up the nose;  \n \nblowing water out the nose;  \n \nand wiping the ear holes. He wipes whatever he can wash of them. \nThe description of the washing is to take water in the hands and \ntilting his head so the water can reach the inside of his ears. He \ndoes not pour water into his ears because that would entail harm.  \n \nIts meritorious parts are seven:  \n \nthe basmala;  \n \nbeginning by removing filth from the body;  \n \nwashing all the limbs of wudu' before the bath;  \n \nbeginning with the upper body before the lower;  \n \nbeginning with the right side before the left;  \n \ndoing the head three times; \n \nand using a small amount of water while doing ghusl completely.  \n \nThere are five disliked things:  \n \nreversing the order of the actions;  \n \npouring a lot of water;  \n \nrepeating the washing after having done it fully;  \n \ndoing ghusl in the lavatory or in a filthy place;  \n \nand to purify oneself while showing the private parts.  \n \nGhusl is washing which covers the entire surface of the body \naccompanied with rubbing because the reality of ghusl consists of \nboth.  \n \n5.1 Things which make ghusl obligatory  \n \n5.1a Janaba  \n \nYou must do ghusl because of janaba  \n \nJanaba results from two things: ejaculation and the disappearance \nof the end of the penis in the vagina. \n  \n5.1b End of menstruation or lochia  \n \nor at the end of menstruation and the bleeding after \nchildbirth.  \n \nAt the cessation of the bleeding of both states, in both attribute \nand judgment. Some of them say that it is attribute rather than \njudgment which was already discussed. You are aware of the \nsimilarity in the attribute, but not in the judgment. The attribute \nis not specific to the obligation.  \n \n5.2 Ghusl with or without wudu'  \n \n5.2a Ghusl without wudu'  \n \nIf, when doing ghusl, you do not include wudu' it is \nacceptable  \n \nIf the person who is purifying himself or herself from janaba, \nmenstruation and lochia confines himself to ghusl without wudu', \nthe ghusl satisfies wudu' and so he can pray with that ghusl \nwithout doing wudu' if he has not touched his penis since the \nminor impurity is included in the major impurity. This is when \nghusl is obligatory, like the ghusl for janaba. As for the ghusl \nwhich is Sunnah or recommended, it does not satisfy wudu'.  \n \n5.2bWhat to do first  \n \nbut it is better to do wudu', having begun by washing off \nany impurity from the private parts or the rest of the body.  \n \nIt is better for the one who is purifying himself from janaba and \nthe like to perform two meritorious actions, one of which is to \nbegin by washing the private parts or any filth on his body. If he \nwashes it with the intention of janaba and removes the filth, that \nis enough for him in the well-known position. He does not have to \nrepeat his ghusl a second time. If he washes with the intention of \nremoving the impurity and then does not wash it afterwards, it is \nnot enough by agreement. The second meritorious action is wudu' \nbefore washing his body to honor the limbs of wudu'.  \n \n5.2c Doing Wudu' First  \n \nAfter this you do wudu' as you would for the prayer.  \n \nBased on his previous statement that it is better for him to do \nwudu', which linguistically is washing the hands to the wrists. So \nhe completes the wudu' which he would do for the prayer. This \nwould necessitate that he washes off any filth on the body or \nprivate parts before washing his hands. That is not the case since \nwashing the hands is put first. So it is better to say that he speaks \nfirst about the judgment, and secondly about the actual \ndescription.  \n \nAnother matter remains. It is whether he repeats washing the \nhands a second time after washing his penis without the intention \nof janaba or not. The hadith of Maymuna (radhi’Allahu anha)  \ndemands that after the filth is removed, the hands are not washed \nagain. That is the definite position of some people, but most of the \ncommentators of Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) say that he \nwashes them again.  \n \n5.2d The question of the feet  \n \nIf you want to, you can include your feet, or if you want, \nyou can leave them to the end.  \n \nHis words show that he can choose between washing his feet \nbefore washing his body or delay that. Some of them therefore say \nthat he can choose between washing his feet before or later. The \nwell-known statement is that he washes his feet before absolutely \nwhether the place where he washing is clean of filth or not. The \nevidence for the accepted position is in the Muwatta' that \n\"whenever the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) performed \nghusl for janaba, he would begin by washing his hands, and then \ndid wudu' as for the prayer. \"So it is clear that he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did a full wudu', which is the school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Shafi‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is the well-\nknown position. It is said that he can absolutely delay washing \nthem whether the place is clean or not. The position about \ndelaying them is more evident than the well-known position based \non what is in the two Sahih collections that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) used to delay washing his feet to the end of \nhis washing and then he would wash them.  \n \n5.3 Description of Wudu'  \n \n5.3a Putting the hands in the vessel  \n \nThen you immerse your hands completely in the water \ncontainer, take them out without holding any water in \nthem, and rub the roots of your hair with your fingertips.  \n \nAfter he has finished wudu', he puts his hands in the vessel if it is \nopen. If it is closed, he pours the water on them. He takes them \nout uncupped without any actual water other than the traces of \nthe water and he rubs the roots of the head, beginning from the \nback of the skull. There are two benefits in rubbing in fiqh: the \nspeed of making water reach the skin, and medicinal, which is \nthat it prepares the head for the water so that it will not be \nharmed when the water is poured on it afterwards since the pores \nof the skin will be closed.  \n \n5.3b Three handfuls of water  \n \nYou then take out three handfuls of water washing your \nhead thoroughly with each one.  \n \nAfter finishing rubbing the roots of head, water is scooped on the \nhead three times while rubbing his head with them. The entire \nhead must be covered with each of the three handfuls and there \nmust not be less than three, even if it is all covered with one and \ndoes his separate parts with it. If three is not enough, he does \nmore until it is covered.  \n \n5.3c Women's hair  \n \nWomen do the same as this. They gather up their hair and \ndo not have to undo their plaits.  \n \nThe woman washes filth off and does wudu' first and wets the \nroots of the hair as a man does. She gathers up and holds her hair \nand it is neither obligatory or recommended in the ghusl for \njanaba or menstruation for her to undo her plaits. The evidence \nfor what he said is in Sahih Muslim where Umm Salama \n(radhi’Allahu anha)  said, \"Rasulullah, I am a woman who \nkeeps her hair closely plaited. Do I have to undo it for ghusl after \nsexual defilement?\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) replied, \"It is \nenough for you to throw three handfuls over your head and then \npour the water over yourself. Then you will be purified.\" It is an \nargument for the one who says that rubbing is not a precondition \nbecause the pouring washes away. As the woman is not obliged to \nundo her plaits, she is not obliged to remove her ring, even if it is \ntight, or her bracelets, nor is it obligatory for a man to remove a \npermissible ring, even if it is tight.  \n \n5.3d Pouring water on right side  \n \nYou then pour water over your right side, then over the \nleft, rubbing the body with both hands immediately the \nwater has been poured so that the whole body is covered.  \n \nAfter washing his head, he begins to wash his body by washing \nthe entire right side beginning from the top and then does the \nsame with the left side. It is obligatory to rub it in the well-known \nposition. From what he says it appears that he does not rub after \npouring water on the right side until water is poured on the left \nside. When water is poured on the left side, he rubs both sides. \nSomething similar is stated in Tahqiq al-Mabani. It is clear that \nhe rubs the right side before pouring on the left side. That is how \nyou find it elsewhere. He rubs with both hands if that is possible. \nIf it is not possible, he delegates someone else to do to do the \nrubbing. The area between the navel and knees can only be \nrubbed by someone who can touch that directly - a wife or \nslavegirl. If he does not find anyone to do that, it is enough to pour \nthe water over his body without rubbing. If he delegates someone \nwhen it is not necessary, that is not allowed in the well-known \nposition. The rubbing should be done after the water has been \npoured, and that is evident.  \n \n5.3e Covering the entire body  \n \nIf you have any doubt about water reaching any part of \nyour body you pour water over it again,  \n \nThe water must cover all the body to discharge the responsibility \nand it is only satisfied when he is certain. If there is any doubt \nabout whether or not the water has reached the limbs of the \nperson performing the bathing, then he is obliged to pour water \nover himself again, and it is not enough to wash it with water still \non his body. \n \n5.3f Rubbing  \n \nrubbing with your hand until you are certain every part of \nyour body has been covered.  \n \nThere must be rubbing or whatever takes its place if that is \nimpossible. It is like that when he is unsure about whether or not \nhe has rubbed a place on his body. He takes water again and rubs \nit until he is certain of that. It is enough that he thinks it \nprobable, differing from those who say that it is not enough. If it is \nenough to make the water reach the skin, which is agreed upon, it \nis better to carry out the rubbing which is disputed. He must \nrepeat until he is sure that his entire body has been covered.  \n \n5.3g Inaccessible areas  \n \nYou must make sure that you include the inside of the \nnavel, under your chin, that you put your fingers right \nthrough your beard, that you rub under your armpits, \nbetween your buttocks and thighs, behind your knees, not \nforgetting the heels and the soles of your feet. You also \nmake sure you rub between each finger.  \n \nThe water and rubbing must include all these areas, the \nneck/throat and that which is under the beard, putting the fingers \nthrough the hair of the beard. The hair of the head is not \nmentioned because it was already dealt with, and other hair must \nbe washed as well, like the eyebrows, eyelashes, mustache, \narmpits and pubic region. Inside the navel must be washed, which \nis a place where dirt gathers, between the buttocks which must be \nrelaxed so that water reaches the folds of the anus, but not inside \nthe anus. Also inside the thighs, which is between the anus and \npenis, behind the knees, and the soles of the feet. It is obligatory \nto put water between the fingers which would have been covered a \nprior wudu'. Otherwise it is done in ghusl. He does not mention \nthings which are far from water, like the lines of the brow and \nhollows of the outside eyelids and under the nostrils and other \nplaces since that was covered in wudu'.  \n \n5.3h The feet  \n \nIf you have delayed washing your feet, you wash them last, \nthereby completing both your ghusl and your wudu'.  \n \nIf they were not washed first, then they are washed, completing \nthe obligatory ghusl and recommended wudu'. If he delayed \nwashing the feet in wudu', he washes them with the intention of \nwudu' and ghusl.   \n \n5.4 Avoiding touching the penis:  \n \n5.4a After the ghusl  \n \nYou should be careful not to touch your penis with the \ninside of your hand when rubbing your body but if you do, \nhaving already completed your ghusl, you have to do \nwudu' again.  \n \nWhen he does wudu' on account of janaba after washing the \nuncleanness from his private parts with the intention of removing \njanaba, he should be careful about touching the penis. It is \nmentioned because it is the most common of several things which \nbreak wudu'. Wudu' is only obliged by touching the penis with the \ninside of the hand. It appears from this that wudu' is not obliged \nfor touching the penis unless it is done with the inside of the hand. \nThat is the position of Imam Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi). The \nschool of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that wudu' \nis obliged for touching the penis with the inside of the hand or the \nfingers. In the Mukhtasar of Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nhe adds \"or by the sides of the fingers\". If you touch the penis \ndeliberately or forgetfully and you have finished wudu', then \nwudu' must be repeated if you want to pray. Otherwise it is not \nnecessary to repeat it until you wish to pray. as is the case with \nother ritual impurities. It is necessary to have an intention to \nrepeat wudu' if he wants to pray, because his major impurity has \nbeen removed and so some say that the intention for wudu' must \nbe renewed which is agreed upon.  \n \n5.4b touching the penis before ghusl is completed  \n \nBut if you touch it at the beginning of your ghusl, after \nhaving washed the areas included in wudu', you should \nthen go over them again with water in the right order and \nwith the intention of doing wudu'.  \n \nAll or part, as is transmitted from Shaikh Abu 'Imran \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). It makes no difference whether he washes \nthem first and then touches or whether he has washed some of \nthem. Following the correct order is recommended. We consider \nthat the correct sequence in wudu' is Sunnah. It is evident that he \nmeans that it is not obligatory in the Sunnah. It is said that it is \nreferring to the obligations of wudu', its Sunnah‟s and its \nmeritorious actions. It is said that it refers to making water flow \non the limbs and rubbing. On this basis and on the basis of what is \nbefore it must mean that it is obligatory.  \n \nThere is disagreement about the renewing the intention of wudu'. \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is obliged to renew \nthe intention of wudu'. If he intends to remove the major impurity, \nthat is not enough. He is in the position of someone doing wudu' \nwho is not in janaba who intends to remove major impurity. \nShaikh al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he is not obliged \nto renew it. The basis of the disagreement is whether each limb \nwhich is purifies first or its own is purified without the full \ncompletion. If we said the first, then it is obliged to renew it \nbecause its purity has gone with the ritual impurity and so it is \nobliged to make an intention to wash it again. If we state the \nsecond, then it is not obliged to renew it because it remains and so \nwe include it in the intention for the greater purity.  \n \n \n \nChapter Six: Tayammum and Its Description \n \n \n \n6.1 When it is done  \n \nIf you cannot find water, then you must do tayyamum, which is \nrecommended. Linguistically tayammum means aiming for \nsomething. The Almighty says, \"Do not have recourse to bad \nthings,\" (2:267) i.e. aim for them. In the Shari‟ah it is a legal act of \nworship by which the prayer becomes allowed. This means that \nthe Shari‟ah has judged it. This exists in wudu' and ghusl. By it \nthe prayer is permitted when wudu' and ghusl are excluded \nbecause tayammum is only to make lawful. Wudu' and ghusl are \ndone in order to remove impurity. It is obligatory by the Holy \nQur‟an, Sunnah and consensus. The Almighty says, \"If you cannot \nfind any water, then do tayammum with pure earth,\" (Holy \nQur‟an 4:43) and in Sahih Muslim the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"We were preferred over people by three things: \nour rows were made like the rows of the angels, the entire earth \nwas made a masjid for us and its earth is purification if we do not \nfind water.\" The consensus is that tayammum is obligatory when \nwater is lacking or the ability to use it lacking it. There are \npreconditions for the obligation: Islam, adulthood, sanity, absence \nof the blood of menstruation or lochia, the arrival of the time, lack \nof water or lack of ability to use it, and that there is no barrier \nover the limbs and nothing which precludes it.  \n \n6.1a On a journey  \n \nIf you are on a journey and you cannot find water, you \nhave to do tayammum, provided that you do not expect to \nfind any water before the time for the prayer has finished.  \n \nThe situation is that either that there is no water to be found at \nall or a judgment that he will not find enough water for wudu' or \nghusl in a journey (or while resident), whether short or not, \nwhether the traveler is healthy or not, and whether the journey is \npermissible or not, because the allowance for doing it on a journey \nor while resident does not have the precondition that the journey \nbe for something permissible. If the allowance is only in the \njourney, like breaking the fast in Ramadan, then the journey must \nbe permissible and it must be a distance of at least four postal \nstages, like that for shortening the prayer.  \n \nThus the mere absence of water is only a reason for the obligation \nof tayammum when he despairs of finding water or he thinks it \nprobable that there is no water. It is not the case if he is unsure or \nhopes for water or is certain of finding water within the time.  \n \nWhat is meant by the obligation is the widest period of obligation. \nThe one who has despaired is someone who has searched for it in a \nmanner which is not arduous for someone like him. He is only \nobliged to seek if he hopes to find it or suspects its presence. If he \nis certain that water does not exist, then he does not look for it in \nthe time. By 'time', the preferred time is meant.  \n \n6.1b Lack of ability  \n \nYou also have to do tayammum even when there is water, \nwhether on a journey or staying in one place, if you are \nunable to touch water on account of illness or are disabled \nby illness to such an extent that although you could use it, \nyou are unable to get to it and cannot find anyone else to \nbring it to you.  \n \nThis is when there is water and you are unable to use it, on a \njourney or at home, because of illness which prevents using it \nsince you fear that using it will cause death, loss of use of a faculty \nor limb, increased illness, delayed recovery, or will actually cause \na illness. If he does not fear any of that, but is only pained by it, he \nmust continue to do wudu' or ghusl. So tayammum is obliged for \nsomeone who is healthy when water exists because he cannot use \nit because illness would occur, or for a sick person who is able to \nuse it, but does not find anyone to bring it to him, even for a \npayment equal to the price which the seller would oblige or it or \nhe does not find a vessel or he only finds a forbidden vessel or \ncannot pay for using it.  \n \n6.1c Danger  \n \nThe same applies to someone traveling who is near water \nbut prevented from reaching it because of the fear of \nthieves or wild animals.  \n \nThis is also true about the traveler who is near water but cannot \nreach it out of fear of thieves as he must preserve his property and \nthe property of others. The property must be more than what he \nwould have to pay to buy water. It must be ascertained that they \nexist or he thinks that it is probable that they exist. Uncertainty is \nnot taken into consideration. The same applies if he fears for \nhimself from wild animals when he is certain about that or thinks \nthat it is probable.  \n \n6.1d Certainty about reaching water  \n \nIf a traveler feels certain that he will get to water within \nthe time of the prayer, he avoids doing tayammum until \nthe end of the time.  \n \nWhether he is in a journey where he shortens the prayer or not \nand he is certain that he will find enough water for wudu' or \nghusl, it is recommended that that he delay tayammum. The \nupshot of the fiqh in the matter is that one of the preconditions of \nthe obligation of tayammum is the arrival of the time. The \njudgment in it varies according to the state of the person doing \ntayammum because either he is certain that water will exist in \nthe time or he will reach it or he despairs of finding it or reaching \nit, or he is unsure about finding it or reaching it in time or hopes \nto find it or reach it in time. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nclarifies these circumstances and indicates it when he says, \"If a \ntraveler feels certain.\" In fact, it is not particular to the traveler, \nbut applies to all who are permitted to do tayammum due to the \nabsence of water. When he is certain that water exists or that he \nwill reach it within the time or thinks that it is probable that it \nexists or that he will reach it in time, then it is recommended to \ndelay tayammum to the end of the time.  \n \n6.1e Certainty about not reaching water  \n \nIf he feels certain he will not get to water he should do \ntayammum at the beginning of the time.  \n \nThis is about the absence of water or the failure to reach it in time \nafter seeking for it. If there is what obliges seeking, then it is \nrecommended that he do tayammum at the beginning of the time \nto obtain the excellence of the time because the excellence of water \nis despaired of. That is how it is judged by the one who thinks it \nprobable that it will not exist within the time or will not be found \nin it.  \n \n6.1f Uncertainty about reaching water  \n \nIf he does not know whether he will get to water or not, he \nshould do tayammum in the middle of the time. This also \napplies to someone who is afraid that he will not be able to \nget to water but nevertheless hopes that he will.  \n \nIf he is unsure about finding it, it is recommended to do it in the \nmiddle of the time. It is affirmed, by Shaikh Ahmad Zarruq \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), that what is meant is uncertainty about \nreaching it. He said that there is no difference between it and \nwhat before it according to the Maliki School. Although it is sound \nfrom the aspect of the judgment, the author's (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) words imply a difference when based on what is meant by \nthe one who hopes. He said that the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) contain something different from the \nposition of the School. That is because his literal words say that \nthe one who hopes does not delay, but does tayammum in the \nmiddle of the time. It is not as he said. His judgment is that of the \none who is certain and the one who is certain delays to the end of \nthe time. Shaikh ibn Harun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I do not \nknow of anyone who transmitted that the one who hopes does \ntayammum in the middle of the time except Shaikh ibn Abi Zayd \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat it is possible that it refutes his words. According to the words \nof Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) by \"fears\" the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) means 'suspects\".  \n \n6.2 Finding Water after doing Tayammum \n \nIf, under any of these circumstances, you do tayammum \nand do the prayer and then come across water within the \ntime of the prayer the following judgments apply.  \n \nThese seven who can do tayammum are: the sick person who \ncannot touch water, the sick person who cannot find anyone to \nbring him water, the traveler who is near water but is prevented \nfrom reaching it by fear of thieves or animals, the traveler who is \ncertain that water will exist within the time, the one who despairs \nof finding it within the time, the one who has no knowledge, and \nthe fearful one who hopes to find it. This is what happens if such a \nperson (except for the sick person who cannot use water then find \nwater or the sick person who can, but does not find anyone to \nbring him the water) finds water. Finding water means having the \nability to use it, its existence, or the existence of a vessel to bring \nit.  \n \n6.2.a A sick person  \n \nA sick person who could not find anybody to bring water to \nhim should do the prayer again.  \n \nIt is recommended that he does the prayer again within the time. \nThe rule for the sick person who does not find anyone to bring him \nwater or any vessel with which to bring the water is to delay \ntayammum to the middle of the time. If he does the necessary \ntayammum in the middle of the time and prays and then before \nthe end of the time of the prayer then that which stops him from \nusing the water is removed, as when he finds what will enable \nhim to obtain it, then it is recommended for him to repeat the \nprayer within the time if he is restricted in that people do not \ncome in to him often. If people come in to him often, then he has \nno restriction, then he does not have to repeat it.  \n \n6.2b A Fearful person  \n \nThis also applies to someone who was afraid of wild \nanimals or other dangers of that sort, and to a traveler who \nwas afraid he would not get to water but hoped that he \nwould. If you have done tayammum for any other reason, \nyou should not repeat the prayer.  \n \nThe one who fears for himself from wild animals or for his \nproperty from thieves is like the sick person who does not find \nanyone to bring him water in the time. It is recommended that he \nrepeat the prayer when he gets water within the time. The result \nis that when the person who is afraid of animals does tayammum \nin the middle if the time, it is recommended that he repeat it in \nthe time with four provisos. That is that he is certain that water \nexists or that he will find it were it not for his fear. His fear must \nbe definite or likely and he ascertains the absence of what he fears \nand the existence of water itself. If he is not certain that it exists \nor that he will reach it, or what he fears is clear, or none of it is \ncertain and someone else finds it, he does not repeat if. If his fear \nis a simple doubt, then he always repeats it.   \n \n6.2c A traveler  \n \nand to a traveler who was afraid he would not get to water \nbut hoped that he would.  \n \nWhen he finds water within the time, it is recommended that he \nrepeat the prayer he has prayed in the time allotted for it, which \nis the middle. Part of the subject is that it is better if it is \nadvanced. What is meant by 'fear' in the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is uncertainty about reaching it. It is \nrecommended for the one who prayed in the time allotted to it to \nrepeat it within the time. That is even more the case if he has \nadvanced it. As for the one who is unsure about whether it exists, \nif he does it before the middle of the time allotted for it, then he \nrepeats it. If he prayed in the middle of the time allotted for it, he \ndoes not have to repeat it. The difference between them is that the \none who is unsure about reaching it, has a sort of falling short and \nso he is asked to repeat it. As for the one who is unsure about \nwhether it exists, he relies on the basis, which is its non-existence.  \n \n6.2d Other reasons  \n \nIf you have done tayammum for any other reason than \nthese three, you should not repeat the prayer.  \n \nIt appears from his words that the one who despairs does not \nrepeat the prayer when he finds water absolutely. It is not like \nthat, and it must be explained. If he finds the water which he \ndespaired of, he repeats it. If he finds other water, he does not \nrepeat it. It also seems from his words that someone who finds \nwater in his bag or saddle or forgets it is there and then \nremembers it, does not have to repeat it. The one who acts \ndeliberately in the three cases has to repeat it, which differs from \nthe literal words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n6.3 Frequency   \n \n6.3a Number of fard prayers with one tayammum  \n \nYou should not pray two fard prayers with one tayammum \nexcept if you are ill and cannot touch water because of \nsome harm to your body which will last at least until the \ntime of the next prayer.  \n \nNone of those seven categories should pray two obligatory or \nSunnah prayers at home or on a journey. whether they share in \nthe time or not, with the same tayyamum except for the person \nwith a constant illness which will continue to the time of the \nsecond prayer. It may happen that he does not do the first prayer \nin its time, either intentionally or by forgetfulness or ignorance. In \nthat case he can pray them both together with one tayammum. \nThis is a general judgment for prayers at home and on a journey.  \n \n6.3b For each prayer  \n \nAlthough there are some who say that even in this \nsituation you should do tayammum again for each prayer.  \n \nFor each obligatory prayer, whether he is healthy or ill, traveling \nor at home.  \n \n6.3c A number of missed prayers  \n \nIt has been related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthat someone who remembers not having done a number of \nprayers can do them with one tayammum.  \n \nThis is a number of fard prayers which he missed by forgetfulness \nor by sleeping through them or deliberately not praying them and \nthen repenting and wanting to make them up: he can pray them \nwith one tayammum, whether healthy or ill, traveling or at home.  \n \nThe first statement is by Shaikh ibn Sha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand the second is by Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand is the famous one. This is why it was rejected by the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) when he was ill at midday when someone \nelse suggested it to him. According to the well-known position, if \nhe disagrees and prays two prayers with one tayammum, whether \nthey are shared or not, he does not ever have to make up the \nsecond.  \n \nAccording to his words at the beginning of the chapter about the \ntime, one does tayammum for the obligatory prayer absolutely, \neven for Jumu'a. That is not the case, since the healthy person \nwho is resident does not do tayammum for Jumu'a since it is a \nsubstitute for Dhuhr. He prays Dhuhr with tayammum, even at \nthe beginning of the time. If he prays Jumu'a with tayammum, \nthat is not acceptable. The sick person and the traveler can do \ntayammum for it. It That is also the case with the funeral prayer. \nThe healthy resident does not do tayammum for it unless it \nbecomes a specific obligation for him since no one else is found \nwho can pray it nor is it possible to delay it until he can obtain \nwater.  \n \n6.3d Voluntary prayers  \n \nAs for the Sunnah‟s and the voluntary prayers, the traveler but \nnot the healthy resident person does tayammum for them, i.e. the \none who is obliged to do tayammum because of lack of water. The \njudgment of the healthy resident for whom tayammum is obliged \nout of fear of illness is like that of the sick person and he does \ntayammum for Jumu'a and the funeral, even if it is not a specific \nobligation, and for the Sunnah and voluntary prayers. If he \nintends an obligatory prayer by his tayammum, he is permitted to \npray the voluntary prayer with it afterwards with the \nprecondition that it is connected to the obligation, even if he did \nnot intend the voluntary prayer after the obligatory. It is limited \nto prayers which are after the obligatory, although if he prays a \nvoluntary prayer before it, it is valid by his statement, 'provided \nthat it is connected to the obligatory.'  \n \nIf there is a long separation or he leaves the masjid, he must \nrepeat his tayammum if he wants to pray the voluntary prayers. A \nshort separation is overlooked. That is defined as about the length \nit takes to recite Ayat al-Kursi. It is also a precondition that he \ndoes not do more than the voluntary. What is \"more\" is defined by \ncustom.  \n \n6.3e What can be used for tayammum  \n \nTayammum is done using pure surface earth, that is any \nsubstance on the earth's surface such as soil, sand, stones, \nor salt deposits.  \n \n\"Pure\" is how the people of firm knowledge and those who know \nfiqh explain \"tayyib\" where Allah azza wa jall says, “do \ntayammum with clean earth,\" Tayyib means pure earth in Arabic \nand that is what Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that sa’id means what is on the \nsurface of the earth in accordance with Arab usage. Others believe \nthat the sa’id in the ayat designates pure earth found on the \nsurface of the earth or brought out from inside of it. This includes \nsalt deposits, and secretions. Tayammum is not done deliberately \non wood, plants and grass and groups. The literal meaning of his \nwords is that tayammum can be done on stones, even hard ones, if \nthere is no soil as long as it has not been baked. It is not permitted \nto do tayammum on lime nor baked bricks, which are red bricks. \nTayammum can be done on soil, whether it has been moved or not, \nalthough it is better when it is not moved by agreement. The first \nis based on the well-known position.  \n \nOne does not do tayammum on other things than earth. Things \nlike salt, alum, sulfur, copper and iron are not used for \ntayammum except in their original place or moved from one place \nto another. But it cannot be in a form which is firm in people's \nhands, like medicines. As for what can be held in people's hands \nlike medicines, it is not valid to use them for tayammum.  \n \n6.4 How to do it  \n \n6.4a Beginning tayammum  \n \nTo do tayammum you hit both hands on the ground - if \nanything clings to them it should be lightly shaken off -  \n \nThis clarifies how tayammum is done. He strikes both hands on \nthe ground. If he is missing a hand, he does tayammum with the \nother. If he is unable to do it, someone does it for him. If he cannot \ndelegate someone, he rubs his face in the dust. What is meant by \n'striking' is not actual striking. What is meant is to place his \nhands on the surface used for tayammum, soil or whatever. This \n'striking' is an obligation. It is not a precondition that anything \nclings to his hands. If something clings to them, he shakes them \nlightly so that some people consider this shaking as one of the \nmeritorious parts of tayammum so that it does not harm his face.  \n \n6.4b The Intention  \n \nBefore beginning, the one doing tayammum must intend earth \nand nothing else with which tayammum is not valid. He must \nintend to make the prayer lawful or intend the obligation of \ntayammum in the first striking. If he is in minor impurity, he \nintends to make the prayer permissible from the lesser impurity. \nIf he is in greater impurity, he intends to make the prayer lawful \nfrom the greater impurity. If he does not call the major impurity \nto mind and thus omits the intention regarding the greater \nimpurity intentionally or by forgetfulness, and prays with that \ntayammum, then he must always repeat the prayer. If he intends \nthe greater impurity, believing that he has it and then the \nopposite is clear, then it allows the lesser. When he intends the \nobligations of tayammum, it is enough for him, even if the \nintention of the greater does not occur to him, If he intends to \nremove the impurity, it is enough for him in the well-known \nposition. Tayammum does not remove lesser impurity. It only \nmakes the prayer permissible.  \n \n6.4c Wiping the face  \n \nthen using both of them you wipe over your whole face.  \n \nAfter shaking his hands, then he wipes his face and does not omit \nany of it. He does not miss the cartilage of the upper ear and other \nthings. If he leaves any of the wiping of all of the face, even a \nlittle, then it is not allowed. He begins from the top, as in wudu' \nand runs his hands over the length of it to his beard. He passes \nover the lines of the face, because the basis of wiping is doing it \nlightly.  \n \n6.4d Striking the ground a second time  \n \nThen you hit both hands on the ground again  \n \nThe second blow is for wiping the hands by way of Sunnah. It is \nnot said how the obligation is done in a Sunnah manner because \nwe say after the obligation that the second comes after the first so \nif he fails to strike the earth the second time and then wipes his \nface and hands with the first, it is adequate.  \n \n6.4e Wiping the hands  \n \nand then wipe your right hand and arm with your left \nhand. To do this you put the fingers of your left hand on \nthe tips of the fingers of your right. Then you slide your \nfingers down the back of your right hand and arm, as far \nas the elbow, folding your fingers round it as you do so. \nthoroughly.  \n \nThe recommended manner of wiping is to first wipe the right with \nthe left, putting the fingers on the right on the left except for the \nthumbs. The palm is passed over the top of the hand and arm to \nthe elbow. It appears from the words of the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the elbow is not wiped because it is the end. It is said \nthat he meant including the elbows as is done with wudu' since \ntayammum replaces it.  \n \nWiping to the elbows is Sunnah, and to the wrists is obligatory \naccording to what is in al-Mukhtasar. Shaikh al-Bisami \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) adds to it by saying that the well-known \nposition of the school is that wiping is to the elbows is obligatory. \nThe dispute is when it is confined to the wrists and he prays. The \nwell-known position is that he repeats the prayer if still within the \ntime. An opposite position is that he must always repeat it. This \nconsequence is rejected. Al-Muqaddamat (Shaikh ibn Rushd) \nprefers that which is followed in al-Mukhtasar, and Qadi 'Iyad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) summarized it in his (Qawa‟id, and it is \npreferred.  \n \nThe well-known position of the school is that the fingers go \nbetween each other, and that is by the flat sides of the fingers, not \nthe sides because they have not touched earth. The well-known \nposition is also that a ring is removed and moving it from its place \ncan be done instead of actually removing it. The difference \nbetween tayammum and wudu' is said to lie in the fact that the \nring is removed in tayammum but not in wudu' because of the \nforce of the water flowing in wudu' which is not the case with \nearth.  \n \n6.4f Wiping the inside of the right hand  \n \nThen you put your palm on the inside of your arm and, \ngripping your arm, slide your hand from your elbow just \nback as far as your wrist  \n \nAfter wiping the outside of the right hand, using the palm, \nbecause the fingers were already used on the outside of the hand \nexcept for the thumb.  \n \n6.4g The thumb  \n \nand then run the inside of the left thumb over the outside \nof your right thumb.  \n \nThis is because it was not wiped before. What he mentioned about \nwiping the thumbs was also mentioned by Shaikh ibn Ata‟Illah' \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) who is the Shaikh of the fuqaha' in his time. \nThe literal of the transmission, which is relied upon, it wiping the \noutside of the right thumb with the outside of the fingers. Shaikh \nal-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I do not know of anyone of \nthe people of language who transmit that the thumb is the largest \n\"finger.” \n \n6.4h The Left hand  \n \nYou then wipe over the left hand and arm in the same way \nand after reaching the wrist you wipe your right palm with \nthe left down to the tips of the fingers.  \n \nAfter finishing the right, then do the left to the wrist. The tips of \nthe fingers designates the inside of the palm and fingers. Observe \nhow he is silent about the left palm unless he says that each of \nthem wipes and is wiped. This is the description which the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned and it was also mentioned by \nShaikh Khalid (rahmatullahi alaihi). He begins with the outside of \nthe right hand with the left and moves to the left before \ncompleting the right. This was transmitted by Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He only moves to \nthe \nleft \nafter \nfinishing \nthe \nright.\" \nShaikh \nAl-Lakhmi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Abdu'l-Haqq (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) preferred that. The position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is preferred. The basis of the preference is \nthat moving to the second before completing the first misses out \nthe excellence of proper order between right and left. Some of the \nShaikhs recommend the transmission of Shaikh Ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) so that he does not wipe the dust on the \npalm, but the one with the reliable position says that the \nremaining of the dust is not sought so that its judgment should be \nobserved.  \n \n6.4i Other methods of wiping  \n \nIf you wipe the right with the left or the left with the right \nin some other way that you find easy, that is acceptable as \nlong as it is done fully.  \n \nIf you differ from the recommended manner, your tayammum is \nstill allowed. It only differs from the best manner. One can deduce \nfrom his words, \"done fully\" that if he does not wipe his forearms, \nit is not allowed because the arms are mentioned in wiping. The \nwell-known position is that if he confines himself to the wrists and \nthen prays, then he repeats it within the time.  \n \n6.5 Judgments about someone in a major state of impurity  \n \n6.5a Tayammum for janaba or end of menstruation  \n \nIf someone is in a state of janaba, or has been \nmenstruating, and cannot find any water to do ghusl with, \nthey should do tayammum and do the prayer and then \nwhen they find water they should do ghusl.  \n \nEven if someone like this finds enough water for wudu', they still \ndo tayammum following the previous information regarding the \npossibility of finding water which is not repeated here. \nTayammum is obliged when there is no water. He mentions it \nhere to refute those who say that someone in a state of janaba and \nor a woman who has been menstruating do not do tayammum.  \n \n6.5b Not repeating prayers done with tayammum  \n \nThey do not have to repeat any prayers they have done.  \n \nBecause their prayer occurs in manner which is commanded. The \nliteral import of his words is that that is the case in the time or \nafter it. It is explained that it is repeated within the time in the \ninstances which were already mentioned. Its literal meaning is \nthat is the case or not whether there is impurity on their bodies. It \nis in the text of the Mudawwana and it is restricted by there not \nbeing any impurity on the body. If there is impurity in his body \nand he prays with it by forgetfulness and they remember after \nthey have finished, then they repeat it within the time. The \nstatement of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) about not repeating \nit is informing about when water is found after they have prayed \nwith tayammum. If there is water before the prayer, and there is \nenough time for ghusl and the prayer, even a rak'at, within the \ntime, then tayyamum is invalid. If they find it after the time has \nbegun and before it finished, even if the time is ample, or the time \nhas begun, but there is not enough time for a ghusl and still \ncatching a rak'at, they pray with tayammum.  \n \n6.6 Further judgments about tayammum  \n \n6.6a Taymmum does not make intercourse permissible  \n \nA man cannot have sexual intercourse with his wife if she \nhas just finished menstruating or the bleeding after \nchildbirth if she has only purified herself by tayammum \nuntil there is enough water for her to do ghusl first and \nboth of them to do ghusl afterwards.  \n \nThis is whether she is a Muslim or a kitabi or a slave girl. \nAccording to the well-known position, it is forbidden for him to \nhave intercourse with her. This does not only imply to actual \nintercourse, but enjoying her between the navel and knee, even \nthrough a barrier, is unlawful. Finding water can either be his \nresponsibility or the responsibility of both.  \n \n6.6b Water for ghusl after intercourse  \n \nThere must be enough water for ghusl on account of bleeding and \nthen for ghusl on account of janaba. This explains the words at the \nend of the book about not approaching a woman bleeding from \nmenstruation or lochia because the literal meaning is that when \nthe bleeding stops, he is permitted to have intercourse, and so \nhere he explains that even if menstruation has stopped, \nintercourse is not permitted, even with tayammum. Intercourse is \nforbidden in the well-known position because tayammum does not \nremove impurity. It only makes the prayer permitted. The words \nof the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) show that tayammum is called \n'purification,' and that is indeed the case since the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Its earth is pure.\" It is also called \nwudu' by since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Tayammum is the wudu' of the Muslim.  \n \n6.6c Avoiding janaba if there is no water  \n \nIt is also deduced from this that if he does not find water, he \nshould not voluntarily bring about a state of janaba in himself. \nThat is the position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-\nMudawwana, i.e. that it is disliked. if he does tayammum for the \nlesser impurity, he should not bring about janaba in himself so \nthat he has to do tayammum for the greater impurity. This does \nnot negate what was already stated about the unlawfulness in the \nstatement of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) about having \nintercourse, because the unlawfulness comes from his going to \nhave intercourse with her when she has purified herself from \nmenstruation by tayammum. This is when he does not fear any \nharm to his body or fear fornication. If he is physically harmed by \nthe length of time or fears fornication, then he has intercourse and \ndoes tayammum.  \n \nOther matters relating to tayammum will be mentioned in \nthe general chapter on the prayer.  \n \n \n \nChapter Seven: on Wiping Over Leather Socks \n \n \nThis chapter is about the judgment regarding wiping over leather \nsocks, the lack of a defined period of time in for doing that, what \ninvalidates it, some of its preconditions, its description and what \nmakes wiping forbidden.  \n \n7.1  Its Judgment  \n \nYou can wipe over leather socks  \n \nIt is an allowance to wipe which is understood from the context or \nfrom wiping because there must be a wiper, man or women.  \n \nIt is permitted to wipe over leather socks. It is a dispensation, but \nwashing is better than it. The permission applies to what is \nunderstood by leather socks. They resemble galoshes, which are \nthick socks with no legs (toes), and they resemble socks which \nhave the form of leather socks, but are made from cotton and \ncovered with leather. The basis for its legality is that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it.  \n \n7.1a Location  \n \neither when traveling or otherwise permitted,  \n \nWiping over socks is an allowance and so it is not particular to the \ntraveler and it is permitted to do at home and on a journey. In the \nwell-known position, it is not a precondition for the wiping that \nthe journey be for something permissible.  \n \n7.1b As long as the socks have not been removed  \n \nprovided you have not taken them off.  \n \nWiping over socks is not limited by a known period of time. It is \nrelated from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that its maximum \nlength when someone is resident is a day and a night, and three \ndays in a journey. This allowance continues, and it is permitted to \nwipe over them without limit within that period until he removes \nthem. If he removes them, it is agreed that it is invalid to wipe \nover them and he should hasten to wash his feet again.  \n \nIf he delays washing them deliberately for as long as it takes the \nlimbs of wudu' to dry, he does wudu'. He is like the one who is \nunable and the one who forgets and builds on his wudu', whether \nit is long or not. If he removes one sock he must remove the other \nas well, and wash both feet. It is not permitted to wipe over one of \nthem while washing the other.  \n \n7.1c Preconditions of Wiping  \n \nWiping has ten preconditions, five of which concern what is wiped \nand five which concern the person who wipes.  \n \nThe preconditions in what is wiped are:  \n \nThat they are made of leather and are not things like cotton socks  \n \nThey are pure and not impure, like the skin of carrion, even if it is \ntanned  \n \nThey are not polluted and pierced except with something like glue;  \n \nThey must cover the place of the obligation (to the ankles) without \nmissing any of it and he must be able to walk in them without \nthem being overly loose-fitting or narrow. Otherwise, it is not \npermitted to wipe over them.  \n \nThe preconditions of the wiper are:  \n \nThat he is not rebelling against Allah azza wa jall by wearing \nthem, and so the man in ihram does not wipe over the socks or act \naffluent by wearing them. This is when the affluent person wears \nthem to avoid the bother of washing the feet or other things which \nhave the sense of indulgent affluence. Such a person is not \npermitted to wipe over them and must always repeat it. If he \nwears them to protect himself from heat or cold or to imitate the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), then he can wipe over them.  \n \nHe must put them on while pure. The one who puts them on does \nnot wipe over impurity, even when they are washed.  \n \nThe one who puts them on in state of purity by tayammum cannot \nwipe.  \n \nHe must fully wash the limbs of wudu' before putting them on.  \n \nHe does not just wash his feet and put them on then finish doing \nwudu', or wash one foot and then put it on before washing the \nother. If he removes them at the beginning and then puts them on \nafter full purity or removes the one he is wearing and then and \nputs it on after washing the second, then he can wipe. The \nmeaning is that the prayer is permitted by it to when he is afraid \nof doing wudu' on account of the cold.  \n \n7.1d When the socks were put on  \n \nThis is if you put them on after you have washed them as \npart of wudu' for doing the prayer. It is in this situation \nthat, if you then break wudu', you are entitled to wipe over \nyour leather socks when doing wudu'.  \n \nThis contains some of the preconditions which permit wiping. His \nwords, \"after you have washed them\" means that they were put on \nwhile in a state of purity which is achieved by water. His words, \n\"for doing the prayer\" means that it is complete in the senses and \nmeaning. So the one who puts on the socks after wudu' and having \nfulfilled all the preconditions is allowed to wipe when he breaks \nwudu' by lesser impurity. It is limited to lesser impurity because \nmajor impurity invalidates wiping because it obliges that they be \nwashed.  \n \n7.1e When it is not permitted  \n \nIn any other case it is not permitted.  \n \nIf it is not like that since he was not pure when he put them or he \nhad purified himself with earth or put them on before his \npurification with water was complete, then it is not permitted.  \n \n7.2  Description  \n \n7.2a  Right Foot and removing impurity  \n \nThe way you do the wiping is to put your right hand on the \ntop of your foot beginning at the toes and your left hand \nunderneath. Then you pass your hands over your foot as \nfar as the ankle.  \n \nThis is the recommended manner of wiping. The ankles are \nincluded in the wiping as in wudu' because that is indicated. It is \ndisliked to follow the creases in it because the basis for wiping is \nlightening. It is disliked to repeat the wiping or to wash it. If he \ndoes that, it is still allowable. It is recommended for him to wipe \nwhen he is going to pray to wash them with the intention of wudu' \nonly or to add the intention of removing mud or impurity, even it \nif is overlooked. If he washes with the intention of removing the \nmud or impurity, or he does not intend anything, it is not enough.  \n \n7.2b  Left foot  \n \nYou do the same thing with the left foot except that you \nput the left hand on top and the right hand underneath.  \n \nThe hands are reversed here. Shaikh ibn Shiblun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the left is like the right according to the literal \nmeaning of the Mudawwana. What is mentioned about wiping on \nthe top and bottom of the leather socks at the same time is agreed \nupon. The disagreement is about the amount which must be \nwiped. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) believes that if he \nconfines himself to wiping the top or bottom of the socks to the \nupper or the lower, it is enough and he does not repeat his prayer. \nShaikh ibn Nafi' (rahmatullahi alaihi) believed that it is not \nadequate.  \n \nBut the well-known position is that it is obligatory to wipe the top \nand recommended to wipe the bottom. If he confines himself to \nwiping the upper and prays, it is recommended that he repeat it in \nthe preferred time. It is recommended that he repeat wudu' and \nthe prayer when he abandons wiping the bottom out of ignorance, \nintentionally or inability if it has been a long time. If it has not \nbeen a long time, he wipes the bottom only. It is like that if he \nonly wipes the bottom out of oversight, if it has been a long time or \nnot. If he omits wiping on the bottom, he always repeats it, \nintentionally or by ignorance or forgetfulness. He builds on the \nintention absolutely if he forgets and if he is unable, if it is not \nlong. Some of the Shaikhs believe that the sides of the feet are \npart of the top.  \n \n7.2c Mud  \n \nIf there is any mud or dung or your leather socks you \ncannot wipe over them until you have wiped or washed it \noff.  \n \nThe dung refers to that of mules, horses and asses. Impure dung \nmust be wiped. It is best to wash off pure mud or dung. Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that that is because \nwiping is done over the socks and this constitutes a barrier over \nthe socks, and so it is obliged to remove it. Shaikh al-Fakihi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) sees it as strong recommendation rather \nthan obligation because if he fails to wipe the bottom of the socks \naltogether, he does not have to repeat it either in the time or \notherwise according to the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). According to the position of Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), he only has to repeat it within the time, not \nany time else.  \n \n7.2d Another form of wiping  \n \nSome people say you should start at the ankles and wipe to \nthe tip of the toes so that any dust on the socks which \nmight get wet does not end up at the ankle end of your \nsocks.  \n \nThis is another description of wiping over the socks, i.e. putting \nthe right on the right and the left on the left, and beginning at the \nankles to avoid moving the dust on the top of the socks in \nparticular because moving impurity from one place to another \nmust happen in any case, whether he begins from the heels or the \ntoes, i.e. impurity is moved to the top of the sock more than it is \nmoved to the bottom, since if he were not to wipe the tops, the \nwiping would be invalid, which is not the case with the bottoms. \nHis words must be examined. When he is asked to wipe the mud \nand wash the impure dung before wiping, how can it be \nunderstood that it is moving an impurity from one place to \nanother, top or otherwise, whether he begins to wipe from the \nheals or the toes?  \n \n7.2e Actual mud  \n \nBut if there is any actual mud on the bottom of your socks \nyou should not wipe over it until it has been removed in \nany case.  \n \ni.e. it is obliged to remove it according to the position that it is \nobligatory to wipe the bottom and recommended according to the \nother statement.  \n \n \n \nChapter Eight: On the Times of the Prayers \nand Their Names \n \n \nThis chapter deals with the recognition of the times of prayer. It is \nan individual obligation for every legally responsible person to \nknow their times if he can do that. If he cannot do that, as when \nsomeone is blind, he follows someone else. The \"time\" designates \nthe amount of time allotted for an act of worship in the Shari‟ah. \nIt is either the time of performing it or the time of making it up. \nThe time of performing is either the optional (ikhtiyari) time, \nmeaning the time in which a legally responsible person can choose \nwhen to perform the prayer at any part of it, or it‟s  imperative \n(daruri) time.  \n \nThe optional can be either the time of excellence or the time of \nleeway. As regards the prayer, what is meant by it in the usage of \nthe people of the Shari‟ah is a body of rak'ats and prostration‟s, \nwhich are transmitted from the supplication (which is the \nlinguistic meaning) since it contains the Fatiha which contains the \nsupplication, which is \"Guide us\" other suras than the Fatiha, and \nit is that whose obligation is known from the Din as necessity. The \none who denies it is an apostate and is asked to repent. If he \nrepents, he is all right. Otherwise he is killed. It is like that with \nthe one who denies the rest of the pillars of Islam which are: the \nshahadah, zakat, fasting and hajj.  \n \nIts preconditions  \n \nThere are five preconditions for its being obligatory:   \n \nIslam,  \n \nAdulthood  \n \nSanity  \n \nLack of bleeding from menstruation and lochia, and  \n \nThe arrival of the time of the prayer.  \n \nQadi 'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) adds hearing the call to prayer.  \n \nIt is one of the greatest acts of worship because it was prescribed \nin Heaven during the Night Journey. That was in Makka a year \nbefore the Hijra as opposed to the rest of the laws. They were \nprescribed on earth. There is disagreement about how it was \nobliged. 'A'isha (radhi’Allahu anha)  said that they were \nprescribed as two rak'ats at home and in the journey and then it \nwas confirmed in the journey and increased to four when someone \nis resident. It is said that four rak'ats were obliged except for \nMaghrib, which was three and Subh, which was two. Then in the \njourney they were shortened to two rak'ats. As for knowing the \nnames of the prayers, that is also obligatory because it is by their \nnames that there is distinction and specification because if the \nprayer is not specified, then the prayer is invalid.  \n \n8.1 Subh  \n \n8.1a Its name  \n \nAccording to the people of Madina the middle prayer is the \nearly morning prayer, namely the dawn prayer.  \n \nIt is evident that a multiplicity names is indicative of the honor of \nthe named. There are four names given to this prayer: as-Subh, al-\nWusta (the middle), al-Fajr and al-Ghada. Subh is derived from \nsabah, which is whiteness since it becomes obligatory at this time. \nFajr is derived from infijar (bursting forth) since it is obliged when \ndawn breaks from the darkness of the night.  \n \n8.1b The Beginning of its time  \n \nThe beginning of the time for this prayer is when dawn \nbreaks and the light spreads out in the extreme east, going \nfrom the qibla to behind the qibla, [1] until it rises up and \nfills the whole horizon.  \n \nThe beginning of its ikhtiyari time is when dawn breaks and the \nlight of dawn which comes from the light of the sun spreads out. It \nsometimes rises from the extreme east and sometimes elsewhere \nand follows it. The place of its breaking is the place where the sun \nrises. This excludes the false dawn which is the whiteness like the \ntail of a wolf, which thins and does not spread. It has no \njurisdiction.  \n \nThe light of dawn continues until it fills up the entire horizon. \nShaikh ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) thought this was unclear \nand said that the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the light \nis in the extreme east and so it is clear that it rises in the extreme \neast. \"Going from the qibla to behind the qibla\" means that it rises \nfrom the qibla. It might give rise to the idea that the qibla has a \nbehind, but it is not like that. Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) replies that the qibla and the east are the same. It is what \nis opposite the west. \"Behind\" means the middle. When the qibla \nis hidden from him, he faces the east and puts the west behind \nhim. Then he is facing it because his deviation from the qibla is \nslight.  \n \n1. This must necessarily refer to North Africa, where the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) lived. The commentators are not sure of the \nexact meaning of this phrase.  \n \n8.1c The end of the time  \n \nThe end of the time is when the light has got very bright so \nthat someone ending the prayer says the salam just as the \nedge of the sun appears over the horizon.  \n \nThe end of the time of Subh. This is derived from that fact the end \nof the ikhtiyari time for Subh is sunrise, and it is the well-known \nposition of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-\nBarr (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is that on which the people \nact. Qadi 'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) attributes it to all the \nscholars and Imams of fatwa. On that basis there is no daruri time \nfor Subh. In the Mudawwana, which is approved, and on whose \nbasis the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar proceeds, \nthe ikhtiyari time is from the rising of true dawn until the upper \nbrightening, and the end is when the upper brightening leaves \nand it is that time in which faces can be seen in a place without a \nroof or covering by someone with average sight. Then the daruri \ntime of Subh is from the beginning of the upper brightening to the \nfirst part of sunrise.  \n \n8.1d Its scope  \n \nAny time between these two points is acceptable but the \nbeginning of the time is the best.  \n \nIt is established that the time of the Subh prayer is the breaking \nof dawn and the end of the time is the clear brightening. The \nprayer can occur in any of that time if he is not excessive because \nthe beginning and end of time subject to choice are equal unless it \nis negated by a constriction. However if he thinks that he will die \nbefore he does it if he does not occupy himself with it, then there is \nagreement that he rebels by leaving it because the wide time then \nbecomes constricted in respect of him, i.e. whoever thinks that he \nwill die during the time must pray early in that time. If he does \nnot pray in that time in which he must pray, he sins whether he \ndies or not. In this respect, other impediments to prayer which \noccur are the same as death, like menstruation. If a woman delays \nand the impediment occurs, she does not make it because the lack \nof making up does not negate the wrong action.  \n \nThen it is affirmed that the ikhtiyari time is all the same unless it \nis negated by a constriction, but you should know that they vary \nin excellence. The early part is absolutely better, whether in \nsummer or winter, individually or in a group. It is like that \naccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and most of the \nschools in order to obtain the virtue of the time. The basis in this \nis that it is sound that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nused to pray Subh when it was still dark as did the Rashidun \nkhalifs (may Allah azza wa jall bless them all).  \n \n8.2 Dhuhr  \n \n8.2a The time of Dhuhr  \n \nThe time of Dhuhr is from when the sun has passed the \nzenith, and that is when the shadows start to get longer.  \n \nThe beginning of the time where there is choice is when the sun \nbegins to decline and has passed the zenith. Then the shadows \nbegin to increase as the sun moves. It is known as \"zawal\": that \ncomes from the fact that when a stick it set upright, it is that \npoint between the increase and decrease of the shadow, and so it \nis not simply the shadow cast, but has to do with its increase.  \n \n8.2b Delaying Dhuhr  \n \nIt is recommended to delay the prayer in summer until the \nshadow of an object reaches a quarter of the length of that \nobject added to the length of its shadow at noon.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is delayed in \nthe summer rather than the winter, in a group or individually. \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"His words 'in the \nsummer' are not understood. It can be like that in the winter.\" \nDelay is recommended until the time mentioned about the \nshadow. The shadow is not measured from its root, but from the \nshadow after noon. However that is an unusual linguistic usage. \nThe well-known usage is that the shadow (dhill) is until midday \ncomes and the shadow is after it is called fay'.  \n \n8.2c In Masjids  \n \nIt is also said that this practice is only recommended as far \nas masjids are concerned so that more people can catch the \nprayer, and that it is better for a man praying by himself to \ndo the prayer at the beginning of the time. \n  \nThis delaying is said to be only about the masjid, so that people \ncan join in the prayer. As for someone on his own, it is better to \npray at the beginning of the time because there is no benefit in \ndelaying it.  \n \n8.2d In intense heat  \n \nIt is also said that it is better to delay the prayer until it is \na little cooler, when the heat is fierce, even if you are \npraying by yourself since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Delay the prayer until it gets a little cooler \nbecause the fierceness of the heat is from the flames of \nJahannam.\"  \n \nThis is when the intensity of heat abates. So there are three \npositions about waiting for the cooling in the case of Dhuhr. Either \nit is absolutely recommended to delay it for individual and the \ngroup, or the recommendation is confined to the masjid for the \ngroup, and the third is to make a distinction between strong heat \nand other times, and so it is recommended in the case of intense \nheat for both the group and the individual.  \n \nThe expression in the Muwatta' is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"When the heat is fierce, then delay the \nprayer until it gets cooler, for scorching heat is from the blast of \nJahannam.\" It means to wait for some shade and for the intensity \nof the heat to abate. The hadith about hastening the prayer is \nabrogated by this hadith. It is that the Holy prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) prayed Dhuhr at midday at the time of intense heat.  \n \n8.2e The end of the time  \n \nThe end of the time of Dhuhr is when the shadow of an \nobject is the same length as that object in addition to the \nlength of its shadow at noon.  \n \nThis is the end of the ikhtiyari time for Dhuhr. The consideration \nof day here is from sunrise to sunset, as opposed to the day in \nfasting which begins when dawn breaks.  \n \n8.3 'Asr  \n \n8.3a The beginning of 'Asr and end of Dhuhr  \n \nThe beginning of the time of 'Asr is the end of the time of \nDhuhr  \n \nThe beginning of the ikhtiyari time of 'Asr is the end of the \nikhtiyari time of Dhuhr. On this basis, they share in the same \ntime for the amount of four rak'ats or 'Asr shares with Dhuhr at \nthe end of its time for the amount of four rak'ats. According to the \nfirst, if Dhuhr is delayed until the time of 'Asr begins and Dhuhr \nis done at the beginning of the time, he incurs no wrong action. \nAccording to this, if someone prays 'Asr at the end of the first \nlength, it is invalid. According to the second, if he prays 'Asr while \nthere still remains the time for four rak'ats of the time of Dhur at \nthe beginning of the second length, he commits a wrong action \nsince he does it before the time of the other has ended.  \n \n8.3b The end of the time of 'Asr  \n \nIts end is when the shadow of an object is twice the length \nof that object in addition to the length of its shadow at \nnoon.  \n \nThis is the end of the ikhtiyari time of 'Asr.  \n \n8.3c Another view  \n \nIt is also said that if, standing upright facing the sun with \nyour eyes looking straight ahead, you can see the sun, then \nthe time of 'Asr has arrived. If you cannot see the sun the \ntime has not yet begun. If the sun has descended right into \nyour field of vision you are well into the time. According to \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) the time for 'Asr lasts \nuntil the sun begins to turn yellow.  \n \nAnother view of the beginning of the time: this is with the head \nslightly bowed but not properly bowed (proper bowing is when the \neyes are facing the ground.) Then if the sun comes into your line of \nsight, it is 'Asr. Some people deny that the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said this since its speaker is not known. The reply to him is \nthat the arrival of the time is not known because this not apply at \nall times because the sun is high in the summer and low in the \nwinter.  \n \nIn defining the end of the ikhtiyari time of 'Asr from the \ntransmission of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), it is \nwhen the sun begins to turn yellow in the earth. The position of \nthe school is that it is better to perform 'Asr in the beginning of \nthe time.  \n \n8.4 Maghrib  \n \n8.4a The time of Maghrib  \n \nThe time of Maghrib - also known as the prayer of the one \nwho is resident, meaning that a traveler does not shorten it \nbut prays it in the same way as someone who is resident - \nis at sunset.  \n \nThis is the ikhtiyari time. The Maghrib prayer has two names. \nThis is because it occurs at sunset, and the other name is ash-\nShahid, meaning resident. This is because the traveler prays it \nthe same as the resident. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that the reason Maghrib is called Shahid is because the \ntraveler does not shorten it as is the case with Subh. Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that it is heard but \nit is not analogous because Subh is not so-named.  \n \n8.4b Its Time  \n \nWhen the sun has completely disappeared below the \nhorizon, the prayer is due and it should not be delayed. \nThis moment is the time for this prayer and it should not \nbe delayed beyond it.  \n \nWhat is observed in that is the disappearance of its body and \ncircular orb, not its traces and its rays. Shaikh ibn Bashir \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that this applies to a location where \nthere are no mountains. When there are mountains, he looks \ntowards the east and when darkness appears, that is an indication \nof its setting. When it disappears and sets, i.e. we can no longer \nsee it because of the intervening barrier between us and it, then \nits time has begun and the prayer is not delayed. Maghrib only \nhas one ikhtiyari time. When it is delayed, it moves into its daruri \ntime. The well-known position is that it is not extensive. Indeed \nthe amount required for doing it after the preconditions of its time \nexist is narrow. It is permitted for the one who obtains its \npreconditions of purity, sutra, facing qibla, the adhan and iqama, \nto delay doing it for the necessary time required to achieve its \npreconditions. It is also said that its time extends to the \ndisappearance of the red twilight. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and many of the people of the Madhhab prefer it because of \nwhat is in the Muwatta' where Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays, \"When the redness has gone, then the 'Isha' prayer is due \nand you have left the time of Maghrib,\" and what is in Muslim of \nthe words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The time \nof Maghrib lasts as long as the red twilight has not gone.\"  \n \n8.5 'Isha'  \n \n8.5a Its name  \n \nThe ikhtiyari time for 'Atama or 'Isha', and Isha' is the \nrecommended name for it because it was used in the Noble Book. \nA group of scholars, including Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), \ndislike calling it 'Atama . As for what is related in the Muwatta', \nthe Musnad of Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the two \nSahih collections from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radhi’Allahu \nanhu), \"If they had known what is in 'Atama and Subh, they \nwould have come to them, even crawling\" where it is called \n'Atama, that clarifies that it is permitted and not unlawful to call \nit that, and there is no contradiction with the fact that it is \ndisliked.  \n \n8.5b The time of 'Isha'  \n \nThe time of the prayer of darkness or 'Isha', the latter \nbeing the better name for it, is when their is no redness \nremaining in the sky from the remaining rays of the sun. \nWhen all yellowness and redness has gone, the time of \n'Isha' has arrived. No attention need be paid to any \nwhiteness which may remain on the western horizon.  \n \nThe time of 'Isha' is when the redness in the direction of the \nsunset has disappeared, not the entire west, as the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) states. Note that he mentioned yellowness \nfirst, even though it is later than redness. However, in Arabic the \nwaw (and) does not demand sequence.  \n \nThe comment about the whiteness is in reference to the statement \nof Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the \"shafq\" \n(twilight) is the whiteness. Our evidence is what ad-Daraqutni \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"The twilight is the redness. When the twilight \ndeparts, then the prayer is obligatory.\" This is the beginning of the \nikhtiyari time.  \n \n8.5c The end of its time  \n \nThe time for 'Isha' extends from this time until a third of \nthe night has passed for those who want to delay doing it \nbecause of working or some other good reason.  \n \nIt ends with the first third according to the well-known position. \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it extends to the \nmiddle of the night. It can be delayed for someone with an excuse, \nlike work, and it should only be delayed from its early time by \nthose with excuses. Other people, even if they are alone, should \nhasten to perform the 'Isha' prayer at the beginning of it its time. \nThis is recommended.  \n \n8.5d Delaying in the masjids  \n \nIt is better to do it as early as possible although there is no \nharm in delaying it a little in masjids to allow time for \npeople to gather.  \n \n\"There is no harm\" means it is recommended to delay the prayer \nin the masjids to allow people to gather. The author's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) premise is weak, and it is preferred that it is \nalways advanced to the beginning of the time.  \n \n8.5e After the prayer  \n \nSleeping before doing 'Isha' is disliked and so is talking \nafter it unless there is a good reason for it.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu) said, \"It is disliked to \ntalk after it more than it is disliked to sleep before it because the \nperson might miss the virtues of the prayer of Subh in group or \nmiss its time or miss rising for tahajjud and Dhikr‟Allah in the \nnight. An exception to that is discussing knowledge and acts of \nnearness to Allah azza wa jall. Exceptions to this are the \nbridegroom, the guest and the traveler, i.e. someone who has \narrived from a journey or is going on a journey, and whatever need \ndemands like talking connected to someone's best interests, like \nbuying and selling.  \n \n8.6 Daruri Times  \n \nThe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) spoke about the ikhtiyari time \nand not the daruri time. Subh was already mentioned. The daruri \ntime of Dhuhr begins at the beginning of the second length and \nthat of 'Asr begins with the yellowing and ends at sunset, \nalthough 'Asr is particular to four rak'ats before sunset. This time \nis daruri for it in particular so that if you pray Dhuhr in that time, \nit is making it up. It begins in Maghrib when it can be finished \nwithout negligence, i.e. follows finishing it. it. That of 'Isha' begins \nwith second third of the night and ends when the dawn rises. The \nlast of it is the amount of four rak‟ats, as there is between Dhuhr \nand 'Asr.  \n \nThese times are called daruri times because it is not permitted to \ndelay the prayer until them except for the people of necessity \n(darura), and the people of necessity are menstruating women, a \nwoman with bleeding on account of childbirth, the unbeliever, the \napostate, the child, the mad person, the person who is \nunconscious, the sleeper and the one who forgets. So when the \nimpediment is removed from any of those, he prays in the daruri \ntime and incurs no wrong action. Anyone who prays in these times \nexcept those with an excuse are disobedient.  \n \n \n \nChapter Nine: On the Adhan and the Iqama \n \n \nLinguistically adhan means informing, whatever it is, and in the \nShari‟ah it is informing people of the times of prayer with \nparticular words.  \n \n9.1 The Adhan  \n \n9.1a Its obligatory nature  \n \nIt is obligatory to call the adhan in masjids and wherever \npeople meet regularly to do the prayer.  \n \nThe judgment of the adhan is that it is an obligation in the form of \nthe sunan, i.e. it is a confirmed Sunnah, in the masjids. It is clear \nfrom his words that there is no difference between the communal \nmasjid, i.e. that in which Jumu'a is held, and masjids other than \ncommunal. There is also no difference between the masjids being \nclose together or whether there is one masjid on top of another. It \nis also done is places where groups meet regularly to pray.  \n \nIt is clear that it is done whether it is in masjids or elsewhere \nsince they seek to call others to the prayers. Every group seeks \nothers. Even if it is not a regular prayer, then it is Sunnah for \nthere to be an adhan. The regular group differs from the irregular \nin that it is a group in a settled place where they do not wait for \nothers in a place outside of a masjid, and so the adhan is not \nSunnah for them nor is it recommended. Indeed, it is disliked. \nHowever in a journey, the adhan is recommended. It is \nrecommended for someone who is alone on a journey to do the \nadhan.  \n \nIt is unlawful to do the adhan before the time has come, and it is \ndisliked for the Sunnah‟s as it is disliked for missed prayers and \nin the daruri time and the general obligation. The evidence for the \nSunnah nature of the adhan is his command and the perseverance \nof the people of the Din on it in his time and after his time. This is \nthe exact Sunnah.  \n \n9.1b Someone who is alone  \n \nIf you are alone it is good to do the adhan  \n \nIt is recommended to do it, whether at home or on a journey. The \nwell- known position is that this applies particularly to the \ntraveler rather than the resident since it is true that Abu Sa‟id \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) heard the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) say, \"When you are in your desert or among your sheep \ngive the adhan. No man or jinn or anything within range hears \nthe voice of the mu'adhdhan without bearing witness for him on \nthe Day of Rising.\"  \n \n9.1c Status of Iqama  \n \nA man must do the iqama  \n \nIt is confirmed that the legally responsible person is obliged to do \nthe iqama if he is a man. Shaikh ibn Kinana (rahmatullahi alaihi) \napplies the words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) to the \nobligation, saying that if someone omits it deliberately, his prayer \nis invalid. Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) considers \nit Sunnah, i.e. the individual Sunnah for an adult who prays, even \nif it is a missed prayer or he is alone, or an Imam of only women. \nand it is enough for a group prayer of only men or one in which \nthere are women as well in respect of the Imam and men. The \niqama is more confirmed than the adhan because it is connected to \nthe prayer. If there is a gap between them, the iqama is invalid \nand must be said again.\"  \n \n9.1d Women and the Iqama  \n \nbut for a woman it is only recommended and if she doesn't \ndo it does not matter.  \n \nA woman commits no wrong action by omitting it.  \n \n9.1e When the Adhan is done  \n \nThe adhan for a prayer should not be done before the time \nof that prayer  \n \nThe aim of prescribing the adhan is to announce the arrival of the \ntime, to inform those legally responsible that the time has come so \nthat they can fulfill the obligation imposed on them. Therefore it is \ndone after the time has come. It is not permitted to give the adhan \nbefore the time for any of the five prayers, even Jumu'a, i.e. it is \nunlawful. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \nadhan for Jumu'a is given before the zenith while it is only prayed \nafter it.  \n \n9.1f The case of Subh  \n \nexcept in the case of Subh when there is no harm in calling \nthe adhan in the last sixth of the night.  \n \n\"No harm\" means that it is recommended to give the adhan in the \nlast two hours of the night before dawn and then to give it again \nwhen the time comes in order to follow the Sunnah. The first \nadhan is recommended and the second is Sunnah. Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) gives the adhan at half of the night. \nImam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) does not have an adhan \nbefore its time like the other prayers. We have what is in the \nSahih that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Bilal \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) calls the adhan while it is still night, so eat \nand drink until ibn Umm Maktum (radhi’Allahu anha) calls the \nadhan.\" Shaikh al-Bistami (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nexact position of the people of the Madhhab is that it is given in \nthe last sixth.\"  \n \n9.1g Description  \n \nThe adhan consists of the words:  \n \nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.  \nAsh-hadu an la ilaha ill’Allah. Ash-hadu an la ilaha \nill’Allah.  \nAsh-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Ash-hadu anna \nMuhammadan Rasulullah.  \nHayya 'ala's-salah Hayya 'ala's-salah.  \nHayya 'ala'l-Falah. Hayya 'ala'l-Falah.  \n \nThen you repeat it in a louder voice than the first time, \nrepeating the testimony. You say: Ash-hadu an la ilaha \nill’Allah. Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Ash-\nhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Hayya 'ala's-salah \nHayya ala’s-salah.  \n \nHayya means to come quickly without haste that would cause you \nto lose tranquillity and gravity. Haste is disliked then, even if he \nfears missing the group. Success is obtaining bliss in the Next \nWorld.  \n \n9.1h Subh  \n \nThen if you are calling the adhan for Subh you add here: \nAs-Salatu khayrun min'n-nawm. As-Salatu khayrun min'n-\nnawm. This is not said in the adhan for any other prayer. \nAllahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. La ilaha ill’Allah. The last \nphrase is only said once.  \n \nEven if he is in a desert and there is no one else there. This is the \nexpression and it means that waking up for the prayer is better \nthan the rest obtained by sleep. They disagree about the one who \ncommanded this sentence, i.e. \"The prayer is better than sleep.\" It \nis said that it was the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and it \nis said that it was 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu).  \n \n9.2 The Iqama  \n \nThe phrases in the iqama are said only once. It consists of:  \n \nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.  \nAsh-hadu an la ilaha ill’Allah.  \nAsh-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah.  \nHayya 'ala's-salati  \nHayya 'ala'l-falahi.  \nQad qamati’s-salah Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar  \nLa ilaha ill’Allah  \n \nThe expressions are said once except for the takbir. Making it \nsingle is the Madhhab. When it is made double by mistake, it is \nnot allowed in the well-known position. So if error and \nforgetfulness do not suffice, it is more likely that the deliberate \ndoes not suffice either.  \n \n \n \nChapter Ten: On How to Do the Fard Prayers \nand the Sunnah and Nafila Prayers \nConnected with Them \n \n \n \n10.1 The Form of the Prayer  \n \n10.1a The state of Ihram  \n \nGoing into the state of ihram as far as the prayer is \nconcerned is by saying Allahu Akbar and no other \nexpression is acceptable.  \n \nIs ihram the intention or the takbir or both while facing qibla? \nShaikh al-Ajhurri (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers the later. \nAccording to the first, the idafa is their words \"takbir al-Ihram\" is \nthe relation of the associate to its associate. According to the \nsecond, it is for clarification. According to the third, is part of the \nidafa of the part to the whole, i.e. the beginning of the attribute is \nihram. It is to enter. This applies to all prayers, obligatory or \nsupererogatory.  \n \n10.1b The Takbir  \n \n \nIt is to say, \"Allahu Akbar\" with a natural extension for the \namount of an alif (Allah). If he fails to do that, then his ihram is \nnot valid. No other expression is acceptable if he speaks good \nArabic. If he does not speak good Arabic, then Shaikh Abdu'l-\nWahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he enters the prayer by \nthe intention except for the non-Arab. Shaikh Abu'l-Faraj \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says he enters it in his own language, but \nthis is weak, even if the prayer is not invalidated by analogy with \nthe dislike of the supplication in non-Arabic by the one who can do \nit in Arabic. But what is relied on is the first statement. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) calls this sentence a \"word\" following \ngrammatical usage.  \n \nThe takbir is obligatory for the Imam and the person praying \nalone by agreement, and in respect for the one following in the \nwell-known position. It is related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the Imam bears the responsibility of the takbir al-\nihram for the follower. If the Imam omits the takbir al-ihram, \nintentionally or by forgetfulness, then his prayer is invalid as is \nthe prayer of those following. The evidence for its obligatory \nnature is found in the two Sahih collections where the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The key to the prayer is \npurification and its sanctification is the takbir and its ending is \nthe taslim.\" Purification is general and includes wudu' and ghusl.  \n \nA precondition of the takbir is that it is done while standing, and \nit is agreed that it cannot be done before that. If that is omitted in \nthe obligatory prayer, in that he says it sitting, or bending, or \nleaning on some support in such a manner that if it were removed, \nhe would fall, then his prayer is invalid.  \n \nA precondition of the takbir al-ihram is that it be accompanied by \nthe intention. If it comes after it, then it is agreed that it is not \nallowed. The same applies if it is a lot before it. There are two \nwell-known positions about whether it can be a little before it. One \nsays that it is allowed and the other is that it is not. The preferred \none is that it is allowed since it is not transmitted from them that \nit is a precondition of the accompaniment. The meaning of the \nprecondition that it accompany it according to the second position \nis that it is not permitted for there to be a gap between the \nintention and the takbir. It is not a precondition that the intention \nactually accompany the takbir.  \n \n10.1c Raising the Hands in the Takbir  \n \nAt the same time your raise your hands level with your \nshoulders, or lower  \n \nWhen you say the takbir, it is recommended to raise your hands. \nTheir backs are towards sky and palms to earth, level with the \nshoulders or a little lower, i.e. the top of the chest. This is for the \nman. As for the woman, it is a little less than that. Shaikh al-\nQarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that consensus on that. There \nis disagreement about the judgment of this raising of the hands. \nSome believe that it is Sunnah and some that it is a meritorious \nact, which is what is accepted. The words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) state that rising is particular to the takbir \nal-ihram. It is like that in the well-known position. It is also stated \nthat he raises them in ruku' and in rising from two rak'ats.  \n \n10.1d Recitation  \n \nand then begin the recitation.  \n \nThe takbir is followed by the recitation without any division \nbetween them. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked for \nthere to be glorification and supplication between the Takbir al-\nIhram and the recitation. Some of them recommend separating \nthem with the words, \"Glory be to You, O Allah, and by Your \npraise. Blessed is Your name and exalted is Your majesty. There \nis no god but You.\"  \n \n10.1e How to do Subh  \n \nIf you are doing Subh you recite the Fatiha out loud.  \n \nThe recitation of the Fatiha is obligatory in Subh and other \nobligatory prayers for the Imam and the one praying alone. There \nare two positions by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in the \nMudawwana about whether it is in every rak'at or most. The \nsound one is that it is obligatory in every rak'at. Shaikh ibn al-\nHajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. In general, it means one \nrak'at, even if it is Subh, Jumu'a or the travel prayer.  \n \nAs for the one following an Imam, it is recommended for him in \nwhat the Imam says silently. As for recitation in what is done out \nloud, it is Sunnah.  \n \n10.1f Basmala  \n \nYou do not say bismi'llahi-r-rahmani'r-rahim for the \nFatiha nor for the sura which comes after it  \n \nWhen he recites in Subh or other obligatory prayers, he does not \nrecite the basmala in it at all, not in the Fatiha nor in the sura \nafter it, silently or aloud, whether Imam or following. The \nprohibition in the words designates dislike since it is true that \n'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"My father \nheard me saying, 'bismi'llahi-r- rahmani'r-rahim ' and he said, 'My \nson, beware of new things. Beware of doing something new which \nthe Chosen one (alaihi salat wa salam) and his Companions did \nnot do.' 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I did \nnot see a man among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) who more hated new things in Islam than him. \nHe was the strongest of the Companions in hating the new. Part of \nthe words of my father were, 'I prayed with the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam), Abu Bakr (radhi’Allahu anhu), 'Umar \n(radhi’Allahu anhu)  and 'Uthman (radhi’Allahu anhu), and I \ndid not hear any of them say it. So do not say it when you recite. \nRather begin with, \"Praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds,\" \netc. When you recite in the voluntary prayers, then there is scope. \nIf you wish, recite it. If you wish, do not recite it.'\" He disliked \nseeking refuge (saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah\") in the \nobligatory rather than the voluntary prayer.  \n \n10.1g Saying \"Amin\"  \n \nIf you are by yourself or behind an Imam you say amin \nafter the words, wala'd-daalleen, but you do not say it out \nloud. An Imam does not say amin if he is reciting out loud \nbut he does if the recitation is silent. There is, however, a \ndifference of opinion about whether the Imam should say \namin when the recitation is out loud.  \n \nIt is recommended to say it. \"Amin\" means \"Answer!\" You do this \nwhether you are praying alone in a silent or loud prayer or if you \nare praying behind an Imam in a silent or loud prayer when you \nhear him say \"Wala'd-dalleen.\" You do not say it out loud, but \nsilently, even if the prayer is out loud. In other words, it is \ndisliked to say it out loud and recommended to say it silently.  \n \nIt is disliked for the Imam to say it if the prayer is out loud, and it \nis agreed that he says it in the silent prayer. However, there is \ndisagreement about the Imam saying it when the prayer is out \nloud.  \n \n10.1h Reciting the sura  \n \nAfter that you recite ...  \n \nAfter reciting the Fatiha, without any separation between them in \nthe form of supplication or anything else. The judgment of the \nrecitation of a whole sura after the Fatiha is that it is \nrecommended and Sunnah. There must be more than the Fatiha, \neven if it is one ayat or part of an ayat . The evidence for the \nSunnah is being more that the Fatiha is that the prostration of \nforgetfulness or lack of it is based on reciting more than the \nFatiha, not the sura. If he does more than the Fatiha, there is no \nprostration. Otherwise he prostrates.  \n \nIt is deduced from his words, \"a sura\" that he does not recite two \nsuras in the same rak'at. That is the best for the Imam and the \none praying alone. There is no harm in someone following the \nImam doing that.  \n \n10.1i What is recited in Subh  \n \none of the larger suras from the mufassal. If the sura you \nrecite is longer than that, that is good so long as it is not \ngetting too light  \n \nThe sura which he recites in Subh should be one of the long \nmufassal, the first of which is al-Hujurat (Holy Qur‟an 49) \naccording to the accepted position. There are other positions, \nsaying from ash-Shura (Holy Qur‟an 42), or from al-Jathiyya (Holy \nQur‟an 45), or from al-Fath (Holy Qur‟an 48) or from an-Najm \n(Holy Qur‟an 53), and extends to 'Abasa (Holy Qur‟an 80). The \nmedium ones are from 'Abasa (Holy Qur‟an 80) to ad-Duha (Holy \nQur‟an 93), and from ad-Duha (Holy Qur‟an 93) to the end. They \nare called mufassal because of the great number of divisions by \nthe basmalas.  \n \nIt is good if the sura which he recites in the first rak'at of Subh is \nlonger than one of the long muffasal, in that you are near a sura \nwhich is one of the long mufassal, not that your recite al-Baqara \n(Holy Qur‟an 2) or its like. This length is in respect to the Imam of \na limited number of people who are content with that or someone \non his own who is strong enough for that. Otherwise, it is best not \nto make it long. \"Good\" here means recommended, and his words \nimply that the Sunnah is only obtained by reciting one of the long \nmufassal, and the recommendation is to do more. That is not like \nthat. The Sunnah is obtained, even by reciting an ayat. \"Getting \nlight\" is when the darkness is mixed with light and vice versa \nbefore it begins to brighten. It is understood from his words that \nwhen it is like that, he does not make it long.  \n \n10.1j The recitation is out loud in Subh  \n \nThe sura is also recited out loud.  \n \nIt is Sunnah to recite the sura and the Fatiha out loud.  \n \n10.1k Ruku'  \n \nWhen you have finished the sura you say Allahu Akbar as \nyou go down into ruku' - the bowing position of the prayer.  \n \nYou say the takbir as you go down. Three things are taken from \nhis words about ruku'. One is the takbir, which is Sunnah. Are all \nof them except the takbir al-Ihram as one Sunnah? That is what \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says and most of the \nscholars take that position. Some say that every takbir is a \nseparate Sunnah, and that is the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and it is predominant view. The evidence \nfor it being predominant is that they stipulate the prostration of \nforgetfulness for omitting two of them. If all of them had been a \nSunnah, then they would not have imposed because there is no \nprostration for omitting a part. The upshot of that is that if one \ntakbir is omitted - except for the takbir of the „Id - by \nforgetfulness, he does not prostrate. If he prostrates for it before \nthe taslim deliberately or out of ignorance, then his prayer is \ninvalid. If he omits more than one, even all of them, then he \nprostrates. If he omits the prostration and a long time passes, \nthen there is a difference according to the two positions. According \nto the statement that all is one Sunnah, then the prayer is not \ninvalid by omitting three or more. According to the other, it is \ninvalid when the prostration is omitted since the second mentions \nthat the takbir is connected to ruku', and is recommended. It is \nlike with every action of the prayer except for standing after two \nrak'ats.  \n \nThe Ruku' position  \n \nYou put your hands on your knees, straightening your \nback so it is parallel to the ground.  \n \nRuku' is one of the agreed-upon obligations of the prayer and it \nhas three forms: low, middle and high. The low is to place the \nhands near the knees. The middle is to place them on the knees \nwithout firmness, and the high is that which the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) indicated here.  \n \nPutting the hands on the knees is recommended, if they are both \nsound and he is not prevented from putting them on them by some \nimpediment. An impediment would be amputation or shortening. \nHe does not bend any further than having his back straight. \nHaving the back straight is not obligatory. It is recommended \nsince the obligation is general - bowing is obligatory. Its fullest \nform is to place the hands on the knees. It is recommended for him \nto spread his fingers based on what Shaikh al-Hakim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh al-Bayhaqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ntransmitted that when he (alaihi salat wa salam) bowed, he \nspread his fingers, and then he prostrated, he kept them together.  \n \nIt is recommended that the back be straight. The author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned both placing the hands on the \nknees and keeping the back straight since one of them does not \nnecessitate the other. Keeping the back straight does not \nnecessitate placing the hands on the knees and placing the hands \non the knees does not necessitate keeping the back straight. Are \nboth of them recommended or is simply one of them alone \nrecommended?  \n \nThe position of the head in ruku'  \n \nYou do not lift your head nor do you let it drop. You make \nsure that the insides of your arms are away from your \nsides.  \n \nThis is recommended. Omitting any of that does not invalidate the \nprayer. It is recommended that the insides of the arms be far from \nthe sides. That is explained as being not very far, but a medium \namount. This does not apply to both men and women. Women \nkeep their arms to the sides. He does not mention the straightness \nof the knees, and he is not excessive in bowing by making them \nstraight. He is also silent about the straightness of the feet which \nis that they are not right together. That is disliked. It is \nrecommended that it be avoided.  \n \n10.1l Awareness in ruku'  \n \nIn both ruku' and sujud you should be aware of your state \nof complete submission.  \n \nYour heart must be humble. This is recommended as is well-\nknown with the fuqaha'. Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that it is one of its obligations although the prayer is not \ninvalidated if it is omitted. It is an obligatory in part of it, and \nmust exist in the ihram.  \n \nWhat to say after that  \n \nAnd then if you are by yourself you say, Allahumma \nRabbana wa laka'l-hamd (O Allah, our Lord, all praise \nbelongs to You.) This is not said by the Imam. Someone \npraying behind an Imam does not say Sami'a'llahu liman \nhamidah, but he does say, Allahumma Rabbana wa laka'l-\nhamd.  \n \nThen you say, \"O Allah, our Lord, all praise belongs to You\", \nmeaning You accept and You are praised for accepting or for your \nallowing that act of worship to be completed. You say this if you \nare alone or behind the Imam. The Imam only says the first \nstatement. Someone praying behind an Imam only says, \"O Allah, \nour Lord, all praise belongs to You\". The basis for these details is \nin the Muwatta' and elsewhere which report that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When the Imam says, 'Allah \nhears whoever praises Him,' say, 'O Allah, our Lord, all praise \nbelongs to You' for the previous wrong actions done by the one \nwhose utterance coincides with that of the angels are forgiven,\" \ni.e. both minor and major. They are only expiated by repentance or \nthe pardon of Allah azza wa jall. In a version of Shaikh at-\nTirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi), \"Praise is Yours,\" This hadith \ndemands that the Imam does not say, \"Our Lord, praise is Yours,\" \nand the one following does not say, \"Allah hears whoever praises \nHim.\"  \n \n10.1m Standing up straight after ruku'  \n \nYou stand up straight, still, and with the limbs settled  \n \nWhen you lift your head from ruku', you stand up straight and \nstill. There are two things here: stillness, which is obligatory and \nwill be discussed, and straightness, which is the Sunnah according \nto Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) in all the pillars of \nthe \nprayer \nand \nobligatory \naccording \nto \nShaikh \nAshhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and it is sound. The difference between \nstillness and straightness is that straightness has to do with \nstature and stillness involves the limbs resisting for a time.  \n \n10.1n Prostration \n  \nand then go down into sujud without going into a sitting \nposition on the way.  \n \nThen you go down to the ground in prostration, going into \nprostration from a standing position as the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did. There is no disagreement that prostration is \nobligatory. You do not prostate from a sitting position as some \npeople of knowledge say. It is useful to be precise. Imam ash-\nShafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that a very slight sitting before \nprostration is part of the Sunnah. The argument of some of the \npeople of knowledge that he did that and the argument of one who \ndenies that he sat before prostration is what is related from \n'A'isha (radhi’Allahu anha) that he (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nthat at the end of his life because the movement of his noble limbs \nhad become heavy. It was not to change the Sunnah. It was due to \nan excuse, and it is negated when the excuse does not exist. If this \nsitting occurs by forgetfulness, and is not long, there is no harm. If \nit is long, then he prostrates on account of it. There is \ndisagreement about when it is deliberate. That famous position is \nthat if it is not long, there is no harm. If it is long, there is harm. \nLength is considered inasmuch as someone looking would think \nthat he has turned away from the prayer.  \n \nThe takbir  \n \nAs you go down into sujud you say, \"Allahu Akbar.\"  \n \nThis is Sunnah to fulfill the pillar with the takbir. He did not \nmention what touches the earth first. It is recommended to place \nthe hands before the knees when you go into prostration and to \nhave the hands leave the earth after the knees in rising by his \ncommand to do that. That is what the people of Madina did. As for \nwhat the people of the Sunan relate stating that when he \nprostrated, he put his knees down before his hands and when he \ncame he lifted his hands before his knees, ad-Daraqutni \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) said that only Sharik has it, and things are \nsaid about Sharik. Some claim that it is an abrogated Sunnah.  \n \nWhat part of the face is on the ground  \n \nYou put your forehead and nose on the ground  \n \nThe forehead is what is between the temples to the forelock. As \nmuch of it as possible is placed on the ground. This is \nrecommended. As for fulfilling the obligation in that, it is enough \nto place the least amount of the forehead. When he puts his \nforehead on the earth, he should not press it hard on the earth so \nthat it leaves a mark - that it disliked because it is the action of \nthe ignorant who have no knowledge.  \n \nProstration on both the forehead and nose is obligatory. There are \nvarious positions if it is confined to one of them. The famous one is \nthat if it is confined to his nose, it is not enough and he must \nrepeat it. If it is confined to his forehead, it is enough although he \nshould repeat it within the time. It is said to apply to both \nikhtiyari and daruri times. This is if the forehead is sound. If \nthere are ulcers on the forehead, it says in the Mudawwana that \nhe indicates but does not prostrate on his nose because prostration \non the nose naturally demands prostration on the brow. So when \nits obligation does not apply, its consequence does not apply. If he \ngoes down and prostrates on his nose, Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is enough for him because it is \nmore than indication. The Mudawwana says that it is disliked to \nprostrate on his turban.  \n \nPosition of the hands  \n \nwith your palms flat on the ground, fingers facing qibla, on \na level with your ears or further back - there being no fixed \nposition for the hands  \n  \nIt is recommend he put the palms on the ground without barrier. \nIt is recommended for the face and hands to be directly touching \nthe ground because it is humility and that it is disliked to \nprostrate on what is luxurious and comfortable like wool and \ncotton. Matting is overlooked because it is like the earth, but it is \nbest to forego it. Prostration on it is different from the first. The \nfingers are spread out on the earth. This is stressed and it is \nrecommended that they face qibla. Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that the reason for that is that they prostrate and so \nface qibla. Prostration itself is done on the hands, like the knees \nand the toes of the feet, and so it is Sunnah. They should be level \nwith the ears or somewhat further back There is no definition as \nto where the hands are placed based on the statement of the \nMudawwana that there is no definition in that. It is all permitted, \nand there is no obligation. If he does it differently, he only \ncommits something disliked.  \n \nPosition of the Arms  \n \nalthough you must make sure your forearms are not \ntouching the ground. Your arms should not be close \nagainst your sides but should be held out a little \n  \nSince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade for a man \nto rest his forearms on the ground like a wild animal. One variant \nhas \"like a dog.\" It is disliked for a man to do this in prostration \nand it is disliked for him to rest them on his thighs. It is \nforbidden, meaning disliked, for a man to hold his arms close to \nhis sides in prostration. It is recommended for a man to keep his \narms away from his sides as the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did. In the two Sahih collections it reports that in \nprostration he (alaihi salat wa salam) kept his arms from his sides \nso that the white of his armpits could be seen.  \n \nPosition of the Feet  \n \nDuring sujud your feet should be upright with your toes on \nthe ground facing forwards \n  \nThe toes should be facing qibla and the knees should be apart and \nthe stomach away from the thighs. The proof that that is part of \nthe Sunnah is what Abu Dawud \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) \ntransmitted: when the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nprostrated, he had a gap between his thighs and they were not \nagainst his stomach at all.  \n \nWhat to say in sajda  \n \nAnd then when you are in sujud you can say if you like, \n\"Subhaanaka rabbi, dhalamtu nafsi wa 'amiltu suu'an \nfaghfir li.\" (Glory be to You my Lord. I have wronged \nmyself and acted badly, so forgive me.) or if you like you \ncan say something else.  \n \nYou have a choice in what you say between saying the first or not, \nand secondly between these words or other dhikrs. The first choice \nindicates a rejection of the one who says that tasbih is obligatory. \nThe second choice indicates the refutation of the one who says that \nthis must be said, i.e. even if the glorification is recommended, it \nmust be with these words, and so the recommendation is only \nobtained by it. The result is that glorification in prostration is \nrecommended by the author (rahmatullahi alaihi)  and others. The \nexpression of the choice means that taken literally, one sides are \nequal, only indicates the rejection.  \n \nYou can also make du'a' in your sujud if you want  \n \nIt is recommended to make supplication using the Holy Qur'an or \nsomething else, but it must be something permitted in the \nShari‟ah and custom which is not denied, and the prayer is not \ninvalidated by it. This is a separate supplication from the \nglorification.  \n \nLength of prostration  \n \nThere is no particular limit to the length of time you may \nstay in sujud but the shortest is the time it takes for the \nwhole body to become still \n  \nThere is no limit to prostration in the obligatory. For the one \npraying alone, it should not be excessively long. If it is excessively \nlong, it is disliked. There is no harm in it in the voluntary. For the \nImam it is what will not harm those behind him. Its minimum \nwhich is adequate is that in which the joints become still and at \nrest. Stillness is obligatory in the prostration and in all the pillars \nof the prayer. But the Risala only deals with stillness in this place \nabout the minimum which makes the obligatory prostration \nadequate. It is obligatory because that obligation, which is \nprostration, rests on it. There is disagreement about remaining \nlonger than stillness. The view of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nof al-Mukhtasar is that it is Sunnah. He examines what is defined \nas extra in respect of the individual, the Imam and the one \nfollowing, and whether it is equal in the length regarding it and \nother positions of the prayer or not. What is said in al-Mukhtasar \ndemands that all of that be equal.  \n \n10.1o Sitting between prostration’s  \n \nThen, saying, \"Allahu Akbar\", you lift your head and sit \nback. In the sitting position between the two sajdas your \nleft foot is folded underneath and your right foot remains \nupright and you lift your hands from the ground and put \nthem on your knees \n  \nThen you say, \"Allah is greater\" while you are coming up. This \nrising is an obligation without disagreement, and multiple \nprostration‟s are inconceivable without a division between them. \nAfter you lift your head, you must sit straight. The bottom of the \ntoes of the right foot remain on the earth. It is not understood \nfrom his words that you sit between the two prostration‟s as you \nsit in the tashahhud. As for the sitting of the person who prays \nsitting while he recites and bows, it is recommended to be cross-\nlegged. He is silent about where to place the left foot.  Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he puts it under \nhis right thigh. It is said that it is between his thighs. It is said \nthat it is outside. Men and women are the same in that.  \n \nYou remove your hands from the earth and put them on your \nknees. He says in al-Jawhar that he puts his hands near his knees \nwith his fingers level. If he does not lift his hands from the earth, \nthere are two positions about the invalidity of the prayer. The best \nknown is that it is invalid. The soundest, based on what  Shaikh \nal-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, is that it is not invalid. It is \naccepted because this rising from the earth is only recommended \nand not doing something recommended is not one of the things \nwhich invalidate the prayer.  \n \n10.1p Second prostration \n  \nYou then go into sujud again repeating what you did the \nfirst time \n  \nThen after coming up from the first prostration, you prostrate \nagain like the first with the relevant details.  \n \n10.1q Rising from prostration  \n \nThen you stand up again directly from sujud pushing \nyourself up with your hands. You do not go back to the \nsitting position and stand up from there but rather you do \nas I have described. As you stand up you say, \"Allahu \nAkbar.\"  \n \nAfter the second prostration, you stand up as you were without \nsitting. This indicates refutation of the Hanafi position. Abdullah \nibn 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu) said that if he sits and then \nstands, and it is deliberate, he asks Allah azza wa jall's \nforgiveness and does not have to do anything. If he forgets, he \nprostrates after the salam. The one who does it deliberately does \nnot have to prostrate. Not going back to the sitting position \nindicates that it differs from the Shafi'ites who say it is Sunnah \nfor him to rise for the second and fourth rak'ats from a sitting. We \nconsider it meritorious for him to go back to the standing and to \ncome up directly with your hands. You say the takbir during the \nmove because it is recommended to say the takbir when beginning \nactions in the prayer.  \n \n10.1r Recitation in the second rak'at  \n \nYou then recite as much as you did in the first rak'at or a \nlittle less  \n \nAfter the takbir, you recite the Fatiha and a sura. The second \nshould be similar or shorter than the length of the first. Both are \naffirmed. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) follows Shaikh al-\nFakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) in what he recommended is that \nthe first rak'at should be longer than the second. The evidence for \nthat is found in the two Sahih collections where the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) made the first long and the second short. \nWhat is meant is that the first is longer than the second in time, \neven if the recitation in the second is more, but he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) recited slowly in the first. It is recommended that he \nrecites by the order of the Holy Qur'an, and reversal of order is \ndisliked. However, he if inverts the order, there is nothing against \nhim. The disliked reversal is to reverse the suras or recite the last \nhalf a sura and then the first half. It is like that in one or two \nrak'ats. When he does the forbidden reversal, then the prayer is \ninvalid. That is like reversing the order the ayats of the same sura \nin the same rak'at.  \n \nand do the same again  \n \nThis means that you repeat all the previous actions. Then you \nperform the prostration and sitting as was already described.  \n \n10.1s The Qunut  \n \nexcept that (being Subh) you also recite the Qunut after \ndoing ruku' although you can, if you want, recite it before \nruku' after finishing your recitation of the Holy Qur'an  \n \nThe Qunut is done in the second rak'at after coming up from \nruku', although it could be before the ruku', there being a \ndisagreement about whether it is meritorious or Sunnah. If it is \nSunnah and he omits it and he does not prostrate for it, his prayer \nis invalid. If it is meritorious and he prostrates for it, his prayer is \ninvalid if the prostration is before the salam. It appears from the \nwords of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is better after \nruku'. It is the position of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe well-known position is that it is better before ruku' based on \nwhat is in the Sahih that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwas asked whether it was before or after and he replied that it \nwas before. It is also based on kindness to the one who is preceded \nand because that is what 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu) continued \nto do in the presence of the Companions.  \n \nThe well-known position is that he does not raise his hands as he \ndoes not raise them in saying \"Amin\" or in the supplication of the \ntashahhud. It is better to do it silently because it is a supplication. \nIf he forgets to do it before ruku', he can do it after it if he \nremembers. He cannot go back from ruku' if he remembers. If he \ndoes go back, then his prayer is invalid because he went back from \nan obligation to something recommended.   \n \n10.2 Qunut  \n \nThe Qunut consists of the words:  \n \nAllahumma innaa nasta'eenuka wa nastaghfiruka wa \nnuuminu bika wa natwakkalu 'alayka wa nakhna'u laka \nwa nakhla'u wa natruku man yakfuruk. Allahumma \niyyaaka na'budu wa laka nusalli wa nasjud. Wa ilayka \nnas'a \nwa \nnahfid. \nNarju \nrahmataka \nwa \nnakhaafu \n'adhaabaka'l-jidd. Inna 'adhaabaka bil-kaafireena mulhiq.  \n \n(O Allah, we seek help from You and ask forgiveness of You \nand believe in You and rely on You. We humble ourselves \nbefore you and renounce all other dins. And we abandon \nall who reject You. O Allah it is You we worship and to You \nthat we pray and prostrate and for You that we strive and \nstruggle. We hope for Your mercy and fear Your certain \npunishment. Your punishment will surely come to those \nwho disbelieve.)  \n \nThis is its chosen expression among the Malikis, although it is \nsaid, \"We rely on you\" is an addition in the Risala. One variant \nhas after it, \"We praise You well.\"  \n \n10.3 The final sitting, tashahhud and salam  \n \n10.3a The final sitting  \n \nThen you do the same regarding your sujud and sitting as \nhas already been described. When you sit back again after \nyour two sajdas you keep your right foot upright with the \ntoes pointing forward and fold your left foot underneath \nwith your left buttock resting on the ground, not on your \nleft foot.  \n \nWhen you finish the Qunut, you go down into prostration \nwithout sitting. You sit between the two prostration’s as \nwas described.  \n \nWhen you sit after the second rak'at for the tashahhud, you have \nyour right foot upright with the toes forward, and the left foot \nfolded underneath, sitting on your left buttock. That is the sound \ntransmission. It is related as \"buttocks\" which it a mistake \nbecause if he sits on them, that it resembles squatting which is \ndisliked, even though it is not actual squatting which is to put the \nbuttocks on the ground and keep the thighs upright and place the \nhands on the ground, as a dog sits. You do not sit on your left foot. \nHe said that in reference to Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) who says that he sits on his left foot. The description which \nhe mentioned resembles that in the Mudawwana in all the sitting \npositions of the prayer.  \n \nAnother foot position  \n \nIf you want, your right foot can be at an angle, with the \nside of the big toe resting on the ground. Both of these \npositions are acceptable  \n \n Without having the foot upright. What the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) mentioned is opposed to Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the bottom of the toes are on the ground and not the \nside. It is preferred. Then you sit for the tashahhud after the two \nprostration‟s of the second rak'at.  \n \n10.3b The tashahhud  \n \nYou then say the tashahhud, which consists of the words: \nat-tahiyyatu Lillah. az-zakiyatu Lillah. at-tayyibatu's-\nsalawatu Lillah. as-salamu 'alayka ayyuha'n-nabiyyu wa \nrahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. assalamu 'alaynâ wa 'ala \n'ibadai'llahi's-salihin. \nash-hadu \nan \nla \nilaha \nill’Allah \nwahdahu la sharikalah. wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan \n'abduhu wa Rasuluh.  \n \n(Greetings are for Allah, Good actions are for Allah. good \nwords and prayers are for Allah. Peace be upon you, O \nProphet, and the mercy of Rasulullah and His blessings. \nPeace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I \nbear witness that there is no god except Allah alone \nwithout partner and I bear witness that Muhammad is His \nslave and His Messenger.)  \n \nThese are the words of the tashahhud preferred by most of the \nMalikis. In the Mudawwana instead of \"Muhammadan 'abduhu\" \nhe has \"Muhammad 'Abdullah\" (Muhammad is the slave of Allah).  \n \n10.3c The salam  \n \nIf you then say the salam at this point, your prayer is valid  \n \ni.e. after saying, \"I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and \nHis Messenger\", the prayer is valid, whether you say part of it or \nleave part, ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, i.e. with either of \nthe two statements or if he says something else. It is not valid to \nsay that it is enough in the form of perfection because he did not \nmention the prayer on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). \nSo the truth is that it a discarded description.  \n \n10.3d Possible Additions  \n \nYou can also add to this, one possibility being:  \n \nwa ash-hadu anna'lladhi jaa'a bihi Muhammadun haqq. wa \nanna'n-naara haqq. wa anna's-saa'ata aatiyatun la rayba \nfihaa. wa anna'llaha yab'athu man fi'l-qubuur.  \n \nAllahumma \nsalli \n'ala \nMuhammadin \nwa \n'alaa \naali \nMuhammadin \nwarham \nMuhammadan \nwa \naala \nMuhammadin wa barik 'ala Muhammadin wa 'ala ali \nMuhammadin kama sallayta wa rahimta wa barakta 'ala \nIbrahima wa 'alaa aali Ibrahima fi'l-'alamîna innaka \nhameedun majeed.  \nAllahumma salli 'alaa malaa-ikatika wa'l-muqarrabeena wa \n'alaa anbiyaa-ika wa'l-mursaleena wa 'ala ahli taa'atika \najma'een.  \nAllahumma'ghfir li wa liwalidaya wa li a'immatina wa \nliman sabbaqanaa bi'l-eemani maghfiratun 'azmaa.  \nAllahumma inni as'aluka min kulli khayrin sa'alaka minhu \nMuhammadun nabiyyuka wa a'udhu bika min kulli sharrin \nista'adhaka minhu Muhammadun nabiyyuka.  \n \nAllahumma'ghfir lana ma qaddamnâ wa ma akharnaa wa \nma asrarnaa wa ma a'lannaa wa ma anta a'lamu bihi \nminhaa.  \n \nRabbanaa aatina fi'd-dunyaa hasanatan wa fi'l-akhirati \nhasanatan wa qina 'adhaaba'n-naar wa a'udhu bika min \nfitna'l-mahya wa'l-mamati wa min fitna'l-qabri wa min \nfitna'l- masîhi'd- dajjali wa min 'adhaabi'n-naari wa su'i'l-\nmaseer.  \n \nAs-salaamu 'alayka ayyuha'n-nabiyyu wa rahmatu'llahi wa \nbarakatuh. As-salaamu 'alaynaa wa 'ala 'ibaadi'llahi's-\nsaaliheen.  \n \n(And I bear witness that what Muhammad brought is true. \nAnd that the Garden is true. And that the Fire is true. And \nthat the Hour is coming and there is no doubt about it. And \nthat Allah will raise up those in the graves.  \nO Allah pray on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad \nand have mercy on Muhammad and the family of \nMuhammad as you prayed on and had mercy on and \nblessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. In all the \nworlds, You are praiseworthy, glorious.  \n \nO Allah, pray on Your angels and those brought near and \non Your Prophets and Messengers and on all the people \nwho obey You.  \n \nO Allah, forgive me and my parents and our Imams and \nthose who have gone before us with iman with complete \nforgiveness.  \n \nO Allah, I ask You for every good thing that Muhammad, \nYour Prophet, asked You for and I seek refuge in You from \nevery evil that Muhammad, Your Prophet, sought refuge in \nYou from.  \n \nO Allah, forgive us for what we have done and for what we \nhave put off doing, for what we have kept hidden and what \nwe have done openly and for what You have more \nknowledge about than us.  \n \nOur Lord give us good in this world and good in the next \nworld and protect us from the torment of the Fire. I seek \nrefuge in You from the trials of life and death and from the \ntrials of the grave and from the trials of the Dajjal and \nfrom the torment of the Fire and from an evil end.  \n \nPeace be upon you, O Prophet and the mercy of Allah and \nHis blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the right-acting \nslaves of Allah.)  \n \nIt is understood that when he has said the supplication, it is \nrecommended that he does not end with the salam until he has \nasked for peace on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). That \nis necessary for everyone who prays as opposed to the well-known \nposition which is what  Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated: that the salam on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) is not repeated when he makes supplication. Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) recommended it for someone following an \nImam. When the Imam says the salam, he says, \"Peace be upon \nyou, etc.\" This addition is weak. Part of its weakness is that it is \nparticular to the one following the Imam as Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) stated.  \n \n10.3e Saying the Salam  \n \nThen you say, \"As-salamu 'alaikum\" once  \n \nAfter that you say that salam which ends the prayer. This salam \nis obligatory without dispute for every one who prays, Imam, \nindividual, or following an Imam. He only ends the prayer by it. \nSpecifically \nincumbent \nis \nthe \nphrase \nwhich \nthe \nShaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned, by definition and order and in \nthe plural. If he says, \"Upon you peace\" or \"My peace upon you\" or \n\"The peace of Allah on you,\" or he omits the definite article, it is \nnot adequate.  \n \nDoes he require an intention to end the prayer or not? There are \ntwo well-known positions. The predominant, as is seen in the \nwords of Shaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi), is that it is not a \nprecondition, although it is recommended to do it. Indeed, the one \nwho is unable to say the salam of release as a sentence leaves the \nprayer by his intention. Then the intention of ending is obligatory \nand the salam does not remove when he is unable to say part of it.  \n \n10.3f The direction faced in the salam  \n \nstarting to the front and turning to the right a little as you \nsay it. This is what the Imam does or anyone doing the \nprayer by themselves \n  \nThis means you incline your head a little to the right. The \ndescription of the salam differs with the different people praying. \nAn Imam or one praying alone say one salam, facing the front and \na little to the right. He begins by facing is desirable. It is sunnah \nfor anyone who prays to say the taslim aloud. As for the taslim of \nsomeone else, namely someone following the Imam, it is best to \nsay it silently. This applies to the man who has no one with him so \nthat any error might result. \"Saying it out loud\" in the case of a \nwoman is so that she can hear herself.  \n \nIt is recommended for everyone praying to say the takbir al-ihram \naloud, and that is the case for the rest of the takbirs for the Imam \nas opposed to the one who is following, and for the person praying \nalone. It is recommended for the Imam to make the salam and \ntakbir al-ihram short so that the one following does not precede \nhim in them. What is meant is quickness without extension.  \n \nThe Imam and the one praying alone should begin to say it while \nfacing the qibla because they are commanded to face qibla in all \nthe pillars of the prayer, and the salam is one of its pillars, even \nthough he leaves the prayer by it. It is recommended to turn to his \nright side in the course of it. If he says the salam on his left, \nintending to end it, and does not say it to his right, his prayer is \nnot invalid according to the well-known position because he has \nomitted the right, which is meritorious. If the one following says \nthe salam to the left, intending the merit with the intention of \nreturning to the salam of ending, and he believes that the salam \nto the left is meritorious which does not end the prayer, and a long \ntime passes before he returns to the final salam, then his prayer is \ninvalid. If it is not a long time, it is not invalid because the salam \nto the left is for a meritorious action, and is to like extraneous \nspeech before the final salam because when he does it with the \nintention of bringing the final salam after it, he becomes like \nsomeone \nwho \nadvances \nsomething \nmeritorious \nbefore \nan \nobligation.  \n \n10.3g The salam for someone following an Imam  \n \nIf you are doing the prayer behind an Imam you say the \nsalam once, turning a little to the right, then you return \nthe salam of the Imam towards the front  \n \nThe salam of the follower is to say one salam, turning to the right \nfor all of it, as opposed to the Imam and the one praying alone. \nThe difference between him and them is that their salam and \nresponse is considered to be part of the prayer, and so they face \nthe qibla at the beginning like all the actions of the prayer. As for \nthe one following the Imam, his Imam said the salam, and he \nfollows him, so it means that his prayer had ended.  \n \nIt is Sunnah for the one following to say another salam other than \nthe final salam in the direction of the Imam, neither to the right \nnor the left. He indicates him with his heart by agreement.   \n \n10.3h The salam to the left  \n \nthen, if there is anyone on your left who has said the \nsalam, you greet them in return. You do not say the salam \nto the left if no one has said it to you \n  \nIt is Sunnah for the one following the Imam to respond to his left \nif there is anyone on his left. It is evident that he does not say the \nsalam to his left unless there is someone on his left who greets \nhim. If he supposes that he did not greet him, as when he omits \nthe salam, for instance he might suppose that he does greet him, \nbut that is not the case.  \n \nThe position of the necessity of returning the salam to the left by \nthe one following if there is someone on the left and he earns the \nmerit of the group. If there is no one on his left who obtains the \nblessing of the group since there is actually no one there or there \nis someone who comes late and missed a rak'at with the Imam, he \nis not asked to return it. Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"Does the one who comes late who caught the merit of the \ngroup reply to the Imam and to the one who said the salam on the \nleft when he finishes the prayer or not since he has missed its \nplace? There are two transmissions: one is that which Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers and it is accepted is that he \nreplies, even if the person on the left has departed.  \n \n10.3i The position of the tashahhud  \n \nWhile you are saying the tashahhud you put your hands on \nyour thighs, clenching all the fingers of the right hand \nexcept your forefinger which you extend with its side \nuppermost \n  \nIt is recommended in the tashahhud to place the hands on the \nthighs close to the knees. This varies. The fingers of the right \nhand are clenched except for the forefinger. It is extended in \nsupplication and glorification to indicate tauhid and to avert \nShaitan based on what is in Sahih Muslim, \"It drives away \nShaitan and he does not forget as long as he is pointing with his \nfinger.\" You point with its side uppermost. The bottom of the \nfinger is not facing the earth or the reverse.  \n \nWhether or not to move the finger  \n \nThere is some difference of opinion as regards the \nmovement of this finger \n  \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is moved, \nand he is relied on. Others say that he does not move it. Based on \nthe position that it is moved, there are two positions about \nwhether it moved in the entire tashahhud or only in the \ntestimonies because he confines himself to the first in the \nMukhtasar. The literal meaning of the words of Shaikh ibn al-\nHajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that the second is the well-known \none. There is also a question in both statements about whether it \nis moved from right to left or top to bottom.  \n \nHolding it straight  \n \nThere are those who say that by holding it straight you are \nindicating that Allah is one God while those who move it \nsay that doing so repels Shaitan. I think they mean by this \nthat you will be reminded in your prayer by moving your \nfinger of what will prevent you, if Allah azza wa jall wills, \nfrom becoming forgetful and distracted. Your left hand is \nlaid flat on your left thigh and you neither move it nor \npoint with it \n  \nThis means he holds it straight without moving it. The one who \nmoves says that it is to repel Shaitan. The left hand is kept flat, \nand he does not point with it, even if his right hand has been \namputated.  \n \n10.4 Dhikr after prayer  \n \nIt is recommended to do dhikr immediately after the \nprayer. You say 'Subhan’Allah' (Glory be to Allah) thirty-\nthree times, 'Alhamdulillah' (Praise be to Allah) thirty-\nthree times, and 'Allahu Akbar' (Allah is greater) thirty-\nthree times. Then you seal the hundred by saying, 'La ilaha \nill’Allah wahdahu la sharikalah. Lahu'l-mulku wa lahu'l-\nhamdu wa huwa 'ala kulli shay'in qadir.' (There is no god \nbut Allah, alone without partner. His is the kingdom and \nHis is the praise and He is capable of all things.)  \n \nThis is done after the obligatory prayers without being separated \nby the nafila based on what Abu Dawud (radhi’Allahu anhu) \ntransmitted that a man prayed the obligatory prayer and then did \nthe voluntary and 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi’Allahu anhu) \npulled him and made him sit. He said, \"Do not pray the nafila \nprayers straight after the obligatory.\" The Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said to him, 'You are right, Ibn al-Khattab. Allah \nhas made you right. The dhikr is done with the expressions heard \nfrom the Lawgiver.”  \n \nThis is the sound transmission with the omission \"makes lives and \ndies.\" Praise is put before takbir and the reverse is done in the \nsalam and asking permission. That is done to be mindful of what \nis found in the hadith. The like of what is here is in the two Sahih \ncollections. In the Muwatta' is like what is in the chapter of \ngreeting and asking permission. The literal meaning of what he \nsays here is that he says, \"Subhan‟Allah, Alhamdulillah and \nAllahu Akbar\" 33 times in a group. A group prefer it, including \nShaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi). Some prefer that they be \nsaid with each one separate.  \n \n10.4b After Subh  \n \nIt is also recommended, after Subh, to continue to do dhikr \nand ask forgiveness and glorify Allah and make du'a up \nuntil sunrise or near to sunrise, but this is not obligatory  \n \nIt is clear from his words that dhikr is other than asking \nforgiveness, glorification and supplication, Some of them say that \ndhikr is recitation of the Holy Qur'an. Some of them say that \ndhikr is explained by what is after it, so it is as if he were saying \nthat it is asking forgiveness, etc.  \n \nThis lasts until sunrise based on what Shaikh at-Tirmidhi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related and said is hasan. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"If anyone prays Fajr in a group and \nthen sits remembering Allah azza wa jall until sun rises and then \nprays two rak'ats, has a reward similar to that of a completed \nhajj.\" This is what the Salaf did. They persevered in occupying \nthemselves with dhikr after Subh until the end of its time. It is \nnot obligatory, recommended.  \n \n10.4c Fajr  \n \nThere are also the two rak'ats of Fajr which you do before \nSubh after the break of dawn. In each rak'at you recite just \nthe Fatiha silently \n  \nIt is not enough if they are done before dawn, even with only the \ntakbir al-ihram because it is a prayer which is prescribed and is \ndependent on the obligation of Fajr and it is connected to the time \nof that which it follows. Two positions are related about it in the \ngeneral chapter of the obligatory prayers: desirable and Sunnah. \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of al-Mukhtasar follows the first, \nwhich is the accepted position. He must intend them as the two \nrak'ats of Fajr to make them distinct them from the nafila \nprayers. If he prays without that, they are not adequate.  \n \nIn each rak'at it is recommended to only recite the Fatiha silently, \nbased on what is in the Muwatta' and Muslim where 'A'isha \n(radhi’Allahu anha) said, \"The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) used to pray the two rak'ats of Fajr and they were so quick \nthat I would wonder whether he had said the Fatiha in them or \nnot.\" Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) recited the Fatiha and a sura in \nthem from the short ones based on what is in Sahih Muslim that \nafter the Fatiha, the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) recited \nin them al-Kafirun and Ikhlas. It is better to pray them in the \nmasjid.  \n \nIf someone enters the masjid without having prayed them, and the \niqama for the obligatory prayer has been given, he omits them and \njoins the Imam and then prays them after sunrise. Their time \nextends until midday. He does not make up any nafila prayers \nexcept them. Whoever sleeps through Subh until sunrise, prays \nSubh and then prays them afterwards. Whoever forgets them \nuntil he has prayed Subh or the time of Subh has come does not \npray them until sunrise.  \n \n10.5. Dhuhr  \n \n10.5a Recitation in Dhuhr  \n \nYour recitation for Dhuhr should be from suras like the \nones you recite at Subh or a little shorter,  \n \nHis words means that the recitation in Dhuhr is equal is what is \nrecited in Subh, i.e. from the long. That is what Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is \nrecommended that the recitation in Dhuhr be a little less than the \nrecitation in Subh. That is preferred. If, for example, he recited al-\nFath (Holy Qur‟an 48) in Subh, he recites something like al-\nJumu'a (Holy Qur‟an 62) or as-Saff (Holy Qur‟an 61). It is not \nunderstood that he recites the middle mufassal. Shaikh ibn 'Umar \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) considers that the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) imply a third position, which is choice.  \n \n10.5b Out loud \n \nbut at Dhuhr none of the recitation is done out loud. In \nboth the first and the second rak'ats you recite the Fatiha \nand another sura silently and in the last two rak'ats you \nrecite just the Fatiha silently \n  \nRecitation is not out loud in Dhuhr, either the Fatiha nor \nanything else. Reciting the Fatiha in the last two is by way of \nSunnah.   \n \n10.5c Tashahhud  \n \nYou do the tashahhud in the first sitting as far as the \nphrase, 'wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa \nRasuluh.'  \n \nHe adds this.  \n \n105d Takbir for standing  \n \nAfter that you stand up but do not say 'Allahu Akbar' until \nyou are fully upright. This is what someone leading the \nprayer, or someone doing the prayer by themselves, does \n  \nThen after finishing the tashahhud to the point mentioned, he \nrises for the third rak'at, and he does not say the takbir when he \nbegins to stand up, but waits until he is upright according to what \nis known in the school in action and because he has not moved \nfrom a pillar. He has moved from a Sunnah to a fard, and the fard \nis more entitled to the takbir, and because rising for the third is \nlike beginning a new prayer. That is how the Imam and person \npraying alone does it.  \n \n10.5e Standing when following the Imam  \n \nIf you are doing the prayer behind an Imam you stand up \nafter the Imam has said, 'Allahu Akbar', and, when you are \nfully upright, you say, 'Allahu Akbar' \n  \nIf you are following an Imam, you only stand up after the Imam \nhas said, \"Allahu Akbar\" and has finished it. When you are \nupright, then you follow the Imam, and imitate it. All his actions \ncome after the Imam's actions. In the hadith, \"Do not precede me \nin bowing or prostrating.\" This tells us that the one following the \nImam follows him because the prohibition against going ahead of \nhim demands following. It negates getting ahead and doing at the \nsame time.  \n \nApart from that, the rest of the prayer, in terms of the \nruku', sujud and sitting, is the same as has been mentioned \nfor Subh \n  \nThe rest of the prayer is the same as that for Subh. The proof of \nthat is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it and \ntaught people. There is no difference in what was mentioned \nbetween him doing it and teaching people.  \n \n10.5f Nafila prayers after Dhuhr  \n \nIt is recommended to pray four nafila rak'ats after Dhuhr, \nsaying the salam after each two rak'ats \n  \nThis is because of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"If anyone perseveres in the four rak'ats before Dhuhr and four \nafter them, Allah azza wa jall will forbid him to the Fire,\" i.e. \npersevering in what was mentioned is a reason for not committing \na major wrong action. Then his body will be forbidden to the Fire. \nThe hadith is related by Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nthe people of the Sunan, i.e. Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh an-Nasa‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn Majah \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Abu Dawud(rahmatullahi \nalaihi). If you said that since it is encouraged to persevere with \nfour before and four after, why does the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) confine it to the four afterwards, I said that it is to point \nout the difference between it and 'Asr where he only does nafila \nbefore it. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it.  \n \n10.6 'Asr  \n \n10.6a Nafila before 'Asr  \n \nIt is also recommended to do the same before 'Asr \n  \nHe should do four rak'ats before 'Asr since it is confirmed that he \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"May Allah azza wa jall show mercy \non a man who prays four rak'ats before 'Asr\" which has the senses \nof, \"O Prophet, show mercy.\" There is no doubt that his \nsupplication is answered.  \n \n10.6b Recitation in 'Asr  \n \n \nFor 'Asr you do exactly the same as we have detailed for \nDhuhr except that in the first two rak'ats, after reciting \nthe Fatiha, you recite one of the short suras such as \"Wa'd-\nduha\" (93) or \"Innaa anzalnaahu\". (97)  \n \nYou do 'Asr like Dhuhr except that you use shorter suras. So if you \nbegin it with one of the long sura, you should leave it and recite a \nshort sura.  \n \n10.7 Maghrib  \n \n10.7a Recitation in Maghrib  \n \nFor Maghrib you do the recitation out loud in the first two \nrak'ats, in each rak'at reciting the Fatiha and one of the \nshort suras. In the third rak'at you recite the Fatiha on its \nown and do the tashahhud and say the salam \n  \nThe third rak'at is done silently. The 'amal is that short suras are \nused. What is transmitted to the contrary is, interpreted, i.e. \nShaikh \nan-Nasa‟i \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nAbu \nDawud \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) transmitted that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) used to recite al-A'raf (Holy Qur‟an 7) in Maghrib. \nSo it is interpreted that it is possible that he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) knew that those behind him would not be harmed by that. \nOtherwise, he would have continued on an easier action.  \n \nYou only recite the Fatiha in the third. After it, you do the \ntashahhud and prayer on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nand make supplication after that and say the salam.  \n \n10.7b Nafila prayers  \n \nIt is recommended to do two nafila rak'ats after Maghrib \nand if you do more than this, that is good. Six rak'ats are \nspecifically recommended \n  \nHe stressed the recommendation to pray two rak'ats after \nfinishing \nMaghrib \nand \nmore \nis \ngood. \nEvidence \nfor \nits \nrecommendation lies in the fact that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did it. What is more than two is good since He says, \n\"Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it.\" Six are \nrecommended since he (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"If anyone \nprays six rak'ats after Maghrib in which he does not say anything \nevil [i.e. haram] between them, that is equal to the worship of \ntwelve years.\" Shaikh ibn Khuzayma (rahmatullahi alaihi) related \nit in his Sahih as did Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThat which is in at-Tata'i from the Sahih of Shaikh ibn Khuzayma \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that they are equal to the worship. One of \nthem said, \"To the worship of the Banu Israel\". In the Collections \nof Shaikh at-Tabarani (rahmatullahi alaihi), \"If anyone prays six \nafter Maghrib he will be forgiven his wrong actions, even if they \nare like the froth of the sea.\"  \n \n10.7c Nafila between Maghrib and 'Isha'  \n \nDoing rak'ats in the time between Maghrib and 'Isha is also \nstrongly recommended \n  \nImam al-Ghazali (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was asked about the words of the \nAlmighty, \"Their sides avoid the beds,\" and said that it is praying \nbetween Maghrib and 'Isha'. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"You must pray between Maghrib and 'Isha', It \nremoves vanities,\" i.e. it expels what someone has disliked, words \nor actions so that he is not criticized for it nor is he moved to a \nforbidden action or from a small sin to a great one which only \nrepentance of Allah azza wa jall's pardon expiates.  \n \n10.7d Other aspects of Maghrib  \n \nAs for the other aspects of Maghrib, they are the same as \nhas already been mentioned regarding the other prayers \n  \nThis is to have the recitation out loud in the first two with the \nFatiha and a short sura, and only the Fatiha silently in the third.  \n \n10.8 'Isha'  \n \n10.8a Recitation in 'Isha'  \n \nFor the last prayer, 'Isha - which is also known as al-\n'Atama although the name 'Isha is more appropriate -you \npray the first two rak'ats out loud, reciting in both of them \nthe Fatiha and another sura. The suras chosen should be a \nlittle longer than those chosen for 'Asr. In each of the last \ntwo rak'ats you recite the Fatiha to yourself. The other \nparts of the prayer are done as has already been described \n  \nRecitation in the 'Isha' prayer is longer than 'Asr. In the last two \nrak'ats, he recites only the Fatiha.  \n \n10.8b Sleeping before 'Isha'  \n \nSleeping before 'Isha is disliked, as is talking after it unless \nthere is a special need to do so \n  \nIt is not disliked to talk after its time has come and before it has \nnot been prayed. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat. It is also disliked to sit up without conversation out of the \nfear of missing Subh and rising at night.  \n \n10.9 Volume of Recitation  \n \n10.9a What is meant by 'reciting to yourself'  \n \nThe expression 'reciting to yourself' as far as the prayers \nare concerned means moving the tongue as you articulate \nthe words of the Holy Qur'an. The expression 'reciting out \nloud' means, if you are doing the prayer alone, that you \nrecite loud enough for yourself and anyone standing close \nto you to hear \n  \nThis is the least of doing it silently and the most is that he only \ncan hear himself. By moving his tongue, he is careful more \nreciting in the prayer with his heart. It is not enough. So if he \nwere to take an oath that he would not recite the Holy Qur'an and \nthen made it flow in his heart, he does not break the oath of not \nreciting.  \n \nThe minimum of out loud in the obligation is that someone can \nhear it and its maximum has no limit. Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Look at the meaning of his words, \"if \nhe is alone.\" It is clear that it is not for the Imam who should \nmake it heard by himself to hear himself and those behind him. If \nthe one behind him does not hear him, his prayer is valid. The \nSunnah is achieved by the one next to him hearing. Shaikh al-\nAqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if he is alone. he \nconsiders the one near him to be another persons praying, and so \nhis principle in being out loud is that of a woman.  \n \nThe place where the out loud is demanded, as in the commentary \nof Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi), is when it does not entail \nconfusing someone else. Otherwise that which will result in \nconfusion is forbidden, even if it leads to making the Sunnah fall \nbecause he does not commit anything unlawful to obtain the \nSunnah.  \n \n10.10 Women's Prayer \n \n10.10a Women's recitation  \n \nWomen's recitation in the Holy Qur'an should be quieter \nthan that of men \n  \nThe woman is quieter than man so that only she can hear herself, \nlike the talbiyya. The loudest of her loud and quiet recitation of it \nis the same, and it is that only that she can hear herself. \nAccording to this, she is the same silently and aloud, i.e. the silent \nis not lower than that which is done with the movement of the \ntongue, i.e. with how a man recites silently.  \n \n10.10b Difference from men's prayer  \n \nOtherwise they do the prayer in the same way as men \nexcept that they should keep their legs together and their \narms close to their sides and keep themselves as gathered \nas possible when sitting and in sujud and in the whole of \nthe prayer in general \n  \nShe is like the man in the prayer except that she keeps her legs \ntogether and arms close in. She does this out of fear of breaking \nwind because she is not like the man in retention. She has a \ncertain looseness. If her legs were apart, she might break wind \nwhich would break wudu'. This is also true of ruku' and she does \nnot put her arms out like a man. What the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) mentioned is the transmission of Shaikh ibn Ziyad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwhich is contrary to the statement of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-Mudawwana because he considers the \nman and woman the same in the form. That which the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned from the transmission of Shaikh \nibn Ziyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) is preferred and the words of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) are weak.  \n \n10.11 The Witr and nafila prayers at night  \n \n10.11a The Shaf'i and Witr  \n \nThen you pray the Shaf'i (even) and Witr (odd) out loud \n  \nAfter 'Isha', you pray the shaf'i prayer which is two rak'ats. There \nare positions about whether it a precondition that it have a \nspecific intention or whether any two rak'ats enough. The evident \none is the second based on that fact that it is valid that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The prayer at night is in \nones and twos. When one of you fears the approach of Subh \nprayer, he should pray the one rak'at of the witr to make odd what \nhe prayed\". After the two rak'ats, he prays the witr. It is a \nconfirmed Sunnah in the famous position. It is said that it is \nobligatory and that it is the most confirmed of the Sunnah‟s. It is a \nstronger Sunnah than the „Id, and stronger than the Eclipse and \nRain prayers. The two rak'ats of tawaf are stronger than the witr. \nAs for the funeral prayer, it is less than the witr and more than \nthe „Id. Shaikh Abdu'l-Baqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) demonstrated \nthat the funeral is more confirmed than the witr.  \n \nIn the best position it is a single rak'at after the shaf'i. The place \nof its excellence is after the shaf'i. There are two statements about \nwhether the shaf‟i is a precondition of completeness or a \nprecondition of validity. The first is taken by the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) of al-Jawhar and Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) clearly \nstated that it is well-known. The second is that he does a witr \nwithout the shaf‟i. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that \nhe repeats his witr after the shaf'i as long as he has not prayed \nSubh, i.e. by way of Sunnah. When we say that the shaf‟i must be \nput first it means its being before it is a precondition of validity. It \nmust be connected to the witr. A small gap is permitted. There are \ntwo positions about whether a long gap is permitted.  \n \n10.11b Night nafila prayers  \n \nIn the same way it is recommended to do nafila prayers at \nnight out loud whereas nafila prayers during the day \nshould be done to yourself although if you say them out \nloud during the day it is still acceptable \n  \nThis means it is permitted. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) related to statements about it being disliked.  \n \n10.11c Number of rak'ats for shaf'i  \n \nThe least number of rak'ats you can do for the shaf'i is two \n  \nThere is no limit to its maximum.  \n \n10.11d Recitation in the shafi'  \n \nIt is recommended that you recite the Fatiha and Sura al-\nA'la (87) in the first rak'at and the Fatiha and Surat al-\nKafirun (109) in the second followed by the tashahhud and \nthe salam \n  \nAfter the salam, you stand for the witr. It is recommended that \nthey be separated by a salam based on the previous hadith and \nthe Maliki Madhhab.  \n \n10.11e Recitation in the Witr  \n \nYou then pray the single rak'at of witr, reciting in it the \nFatiha, Surat al-Ikhlas and the two suras of protection. \n[113 and 114.] If you do more than one pair of rak'ats for \nthe Shaf'i you do the Witr at the end \n  \nThis recitation is recommended. Qadi ibn al-'Arabi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the one who strives recites in it the end of his \nhizb and others recite Ikhlas. The accepted position which the \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned is based on what Abu \nDawud (radhi’Allahu anhu) and others related. 'A'isha \n(radhi’Allahu anha) was asked what the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) recited in the witr. She said, \"He used to recite al-\nA'la in the first, al-Kafirun in the second and Ikhlas and the suras \nof protection in the third. It is clear that this answer does not \nconform to the literal words of the question because it literally was \nwhether he did the witr with three or something else. So perhaps \nshe understood that the asker meant what the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) recited in his witr.  \n \n10.11f The night prayers of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to pray twelve \nrak'ats at night making the number odd by praying one \nrak'at at the end. It is also said that he did twenty rak'ats \nmaking the number odd by adding one rak'at at the end  \n \nThere are sound transmissions in the Sahih, i.e. from the hadith \nof 'A'isha (radhi’Allahu anha) and there is no contradiction \nbetween the transmission of 12 rak'ats and that of 11 rak'ats \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to begin his \nprayer with two quick rak'ats after wudu' and sometimes they \nwere considered part of his devotions. So sometimes she reported \n12 and sometimes did not because they were connected to wudu' \nand the release of the knot of Shaitan, and so she reported ten \nrak'ats. Standing at night or tahajjud was an obligation in respect \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and recommended for \nus since he said, \"You should stand at night. It is the habit of the \nrighteous before you and an act of nearness for your Lord and an \nexpiation of evil deeds and prevents wrong actions.  \n \n10.11g Best time  \n \nThe best time for doing night prayers is the last part of the \nnight \n  \nThis is for the sake of tahajjud according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and his followers based on what is in the two \nSahih collections where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsays, \"Our Lord descends every night to the lower heaven when a \nthird of the night remains. He says, 'Is there any who calls on Me \nso that I can answer him? Who asks of Me so that I can give to \nhim? Who asks My forgiveness so that I can forgive him?\" Imam \nash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) singled out the middle of the \nnight by the report that the Prophet Da'ud (alaihi salam) used to \nsleep half the night and stand in prayer for a third of it and then \nsleep a sixth. Then it is established that the end of the night is \nbetter.  \n \n10.11h Delaying night prayers  \n \nFor this reason it is better to delay your nafila night \nprayers and your Witr until the last part of the night. \nHowever, if you are someone who does not usually wake up \nin time you should do your Witr, along with any nafila \nprayers you want to do, at the beginning of the night  \n \nThis is based on what is in Muslim and elsewhere from the marfu' \nhadith of Jabir (radhi’Allahu anhu): \"Anyone who is afraid that \nhe will not get up at the end of the night should do his witr at its \nbeginning. Anyone who intends to get up at the end of night, \nshould do the witr at its end. The prayer at the end of the night is \nwitnessed\" i.e. the angels of mercy attend it. The upshot is that it \nis recommended to delay the witr in two cases if it is his custom to \nwake up at the end of the night or whether he does or does not is \nequal. It is prayed before in one case. which is when he usually \nsleeps until Subh.  \n \n10.11i Prayers after the Witr  \n \nand then if you do wake up in the last part of the night you \ncan do whatever nafila prayers you want to in pairs, but \nyou do not repeat the Witr \n  \nIf someone does not usually awake up and does his witr before and \nhis nafila as is best for him, and then he later wakes at the end of \nthe night, he can do whatever nafila he wishes because the fact \nthat he has already done the witr does not keep him from \nbeginning prayers after it. However the place of that is when he \nhas the intention of nafila after the witr or during it, not that it \nhappens before he begins the witr. If he intends to do nafila after \nthe witr, that is not permitted. Indeed it is disliked. The best is for \nthe nafila to be in pairs of two rak'ats based on the hadith about \nthe night prayer being in twos. Then when he finishes his nafila, \nhe does not repeat the witr since doing it after 'Isha' was valid and \nit is feared that it is disliked for him to repeat the witr since the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There are not two \nwitrs in the night,\" as Abu Dawud (radhi’Allahu anhu) and \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted it.  \n \n10.11j Oversleeping  \n \nIf you normally pray at the end of the night but oversleep, \nyou can still do your night prayers overlapping the time of \nFajr up to when it begins to get light \n  \nConnected to oversleeping is the one who becomes unconscious, \ninsane, or menstruates and then the excuse disappears at dawn. \nHe did not deliberately delay it and so he does not have to pray it, \neven if he is able to do it with Fajr and Subh before it gets light. \nHe is permitted to do it between dawn and light. The precondition \nfor doing it is that he does not fear that it will get light and that \nhe slept through it by being overcome and that he does not fear \nmissing the group. If he lacks its precondition, he omits it and \nprays Subh without the shaf'i and witr because they are done after \nFajr without any precondition.  \n \nWhen someone sleeps through his normal prayers until after Fajr, \nhe does the witr because it has two times, ikhtiyari which is after \nthe 'Isha' prayer until dawn, and a daruri time from dawn until he \nprays Subh according to the well-known position by the one who \nsays that the witr is not prayed after dawn.  \n \n10.11k Praying witr late  \n \nThen you pray your Witr and do Subh \n  \nIf he prays Subh and omits witr, he prays it after the time of the \nnafila. This is if there is enough time for three rak'ats. If there is \nonly enough time for two rak'ats, he leaves the witr and prays \nSubh in the well-known position. Opposite it is the statement of \nShaikh Asbagh (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he prays the witr as one \nrak'at and one rak'at of Subh before the sun. If there is only \nenough time for one rak'at, then Subh is incumbent by agreement. \nIf there is enough time for five or six, he prays the Shaf'i and witr \nand Subh and omits Fajr. If it is ample enough for seven, he prays \nall.  \n \n10.11l Witr after Subh  \n \nIf you remember that you have not prayed Witr after you \nhave done Subh you do not make it up \n  \nThe like of it is in the Muwatta' from a group of Companions. If he \nforgets the witr and remembers it in the Subh prayer, it is \nrecommended that he step in the famous view if he is alone and \nthen pray the witr and then start the Subh prayer again, i.e. after \nhe repeats the Fajr after the witr. It is even more so if he \nremembers the witr after the Fajr prayer and before beginning \nSubh. So he prays the witr and then repeats Fajr. It is the same if \nhe has prayed Fajr and then remembers an obligatory prayer \nbefore Subh, it is few. Then he repeats Fajr after he has prayed \nthe missed prayer. If he is following an Imam, it is recommended \nthat he continue, even if he is certain that if he stops the prayer \nand prays the witr, he will catch the excellence of the group. There \nare two transmissions about the Imam. One is that he stops and \nthe other that he does not. According to the position that he stops, \ndoes he appoint a deputy based on an analogy with minor \nimpurity or does he not do so based on analogy of what was \nmentioned of a prayer in a prayer. According to the statement that \nhe does not appoint a deputy, does the one following stop or not? \nHe appoints and they complete their prayer. This disagreement \nabout stopping or continuing is when the time is ample. If the \ntime is short, he continues without disagreement.  \n \n10.12 Entering the Masjid  \n \n10.12a Two rak'ats  \n \nIf you are in wudu' when you go into a masjid you should \nnot sit down until you have prayed two rak'ats  \n \nWhen you enter a masjid, it is disliked to sit before praying and \nthis is not eliminated by the fact of sitting. If he enters often, then \nthe first is enough for him if he returns to the masjid soon by \ncustom. Otherwise he should do it again.  \n \nThese two are a greeting for the masjid which is meritorious and \nis accepted. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat they are Sunnah. The basis for this is the words of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"When one of you enters the \nmasjid, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak'ats.\" \n(Sahih Muslim in the form of a prohibition) Sahih al-Bukhari has \nit, \"When one of you enters the masjid, he should do two rak'ats \nbefore he sits, by way of command. This command is by way of \nmeritorious action, not by obligation, and the prohibition is dislike \nand not prohibition.  \n \nThere is no difference in the command to greet the masjid on the \nFriday masjid or others except the masjid of Makka. In it he \nbegins with the tawaf when it is demanded of him, even if by \nrecommendation or it is desirable for someone coming from \noutside to do them first or who does not intend it. If he is in \nMakka and does not have to do tawaf and does not desire it, but \nhe enters it for the prayer or to visit the House and greets it with \ntwo rak‟ats if it is the time in which the nafila is allowed. \nOtherwise, he sits like in any other masjid. An exception is also \nthe masjid of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) according \nto one of two statements of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that \nhe begins with the greeting to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) before beginning to bow and the other is that he begins \nwith ruku' and Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrecommends it and he is relied on because the greeting is the right \nof Allah azza wa jall and the greeting is a human right and the \nfirst is more confirmed.  \n \n10.12b The time  \n \nprovided it is at a time when you are allowed to pray \n  \nA precondition for greeting the masjid is that it is a time in which \nprayer is permitted. If a prohibited time has begun, like sunrise \nand sunset, the khutba for Jumu'a, after 'Asr and after Fajr, then \nit is obligatory that he does not pray in sunrise, sunset and the \nkhutba, and desirable that he not pray after 'Asr and Fajr. If he \nbegins the prayer in a prohibited time, then it is obligatory to stop \nand it is recommended in a disliked time.  \n \nIt is recommended for the one who is not permitted to greet \nbecause of the prior impediments to say four times, \"Glory be to \nAllah and praise belongs to Allah. There is no god but Allah and \nAllah is greater\" and he performs the greeting with the fard \nprayer or, which is better, with a Sunnah or desirable prayer. He \nobtains the reward if he intends the greeting and the fard.  \n \n10.12c Fajr taking their place  \n \nIf you go into the masjid before you have done the two \nrak'ats of Fajr they take the place of those two rak'ats. If \nyou have already prayed the two rak'ats of Fajr before you \ngo to the masjid, there is a difference of opinion about \nwhat you should do. Some people say you pray two rak'ats \nand some people say you do not \n  \nIn such a case, the two rak'ats of Fajr suffice for the greeting of \nthe masjid and he does not pray the two rak'ats of greeting the \nmasjid before it. That is accepted position. It is also said that he \nprays them, but that is weak. If you said that time does not \ndemand the greeting and satisfying the thing is a branch of \ndemanding it, I said that this is based on the position that the \ngreeting is demanded at this time. If you pray them at home and \nthen go to the masjid and find that the iqama for the prayer has \nnot been given, there is disagreement about someone who prays \nthe Sunnah of Fajr outside it. It is said that he prays two rak'ats \nand some say that the sits down before praying, and that is \naccepted.  \n \n10.12d No nafila prayers between dawn and sunrise  \n \nBetween the break of dawn and sunrise there are no nafila \nprayers except the two rak'ats of Fajr \n  \ni.e. and the regular prayers of the one who slept through them as \nwas stated, the shaf'i and the witr absolutely, the funeral for the \none it is not feared will putrefy, and the prostration of recitation \nare done before brightening, and so doing them in that time is \ndisliked. When you fear the corpse will putrefy, it is no unlawful \nto pray over him at the time of prohibition and it is not disliked at \nthe disliked time. When he fears that the corpse will putrefy and \nprays over it at the time of prohibition or dislike, the prayer over \nhim is not repeated when it is permitted, whether he is buried or \nnot. It is like that in the prohibited time if he is buried. Otherwise \nit is repeated.  \n \nWhen the sun begins to rise, nafila are forbidden, including the \nfuneral, the prostration of recitation and vowed nafila to preserve \nthe root until it has fully risen, and the dislike lasts until it has \nrisen the length of a spear from the spears which are measured as \n12 spans.  \n \n \n \nChapter Eleven: the Function of the Imam \n \n \n11.1 The office of Imam  \n \nOn leading the prayer and judgments concerning the Imam \nand those who pray behind an Imam  \n \nThis chapter clarifies who is the best person to be the Imam and \nwho it is disliked to have as Imam. When someone prays alone, \nthat takes the place of the group. It also clarifies one who joins \nalone on the night of rain. The judgment of the one following is \nthat he recites with the Imam when it is silent and he stands at \nthe right of the Imam when he is alone.  \n \n11.1a The best one to be Imam  \n \nThe man who should lead a group of people in prayer is the \nbest and most knowledgeable one among them \n  \nThe one who leads them is the one with the greatest virtue, i.e. if \na group gather, and all are excellent and one is more so, he is the \none who is entitled to be Imam. It is said that the amount of \nknowledge has to do with the excellence.  \n \n11.1b Women cannot be Imams  \n \nWomen cannot lead the prayer. This is the case whether \nthe prayer is fard or nafila and whether the group in \nquestion are men or women \n  \nAs the woman does not lead the prayer, neither does the \nhermaphrodite. If either of them lead the prayer, the prayer must \nalways be repeated according to the Maliki Madhhab whether \nthose following are like them or not. Their own prayers are valid, \neven if they intend to be the Imams. Abu Ibrahim al-Andalusi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) disagrees with that and says, \"Any woman \nor a hermaphrodite like her who resembles a woman who leads a \nprayer must repeat it within the time. Know that actually being a \nmale is a precondition for the validity of being an Imam.   \n \n11.1c Non-Muslims cannot be Imams  \n \nIn addition to this precondition, there is another precondition, \nwhich is being a Muslim. The Imamate of an unbeliever is not \nvalid.  \n \n11.1d Imams must be adults  \n \nAlso maturity is a precondition and it is not valid for a child to be \nthe Imam of an adult in the obligatory prayer because the child is \ndoing nafila and nafila does not make someone following in a fard \nprayer valid. \n \n11.1e Imams must be sane  \n \nAnother precondition is sanity. The Imamate of a madman is not \nvalid.  \n \n11.1f The Imam must know the prayer and be upright  \n \nAnother precondition is knowledge. The prayer is not valid except \nlead by someone with recitation, fiqh, uprightness and the ability \nto perform the pillars of the prayer. The one who is ignorant of \nrecitation or fiqh cannot validly lead in prayer someone who has \nknowledge. As for someone who is illiterate like him, that is valid \nwhen there is no one present who can read.  \n \n11.1g The Imam must have good character  \n \nBy good character is meant lack of impiety connected to the \nprayer. The impiety in the person who is impious towards it is \nsomeone who intends to be an Imam through pride and so his \nImamate is not valid. As for the impiety of the limb, like the \nfornicator, it is disliked for him to be the Imam but his prayer is \nvalid as opposed to what is followed by the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) of al-Mukhtasar that it is invalid by such an impious \nperson.  \n \n11.1h Ability  \n \nSimilarly invalid is the Imamate of the one who is unable to \nperform some of the pillars of the prayer which are fard for the \none who is able to.   \n \n11.1i Congruence  \n \nThere must be congruence in the one followed, i.e. the person, \nplace and time. Doing dhuhr behind someone doing 'Asr is not \nvalid nor the reverse, nor performing a prayer behind someone \nmaking one up or the reverse, nor Dhuhr of Saturday behind \nDhuhr of Sunday nor the reverse.   \n \n11.1j Agreement of madhhab  \n \nThe agreement of the school of the one following with the Imam in \nobligatory parts. So it is not valid to follow someone who omits the \nrecitation in the last two or fails to rise from ruku' or prostration, \nfor instance, and residence and freedom in Jumu'a. So the \nImamate of the traveler is not valid except when he is the khalif. \nWhat is meant by a traveler is the one outside of the land of the \nJumu'a by a farsang. The Imamate of a slave on Jumu'a is not \nvalid, and the Jumu'a must be repeated if that is possible.  \n \n11.1k Reciting with the Imam  \n \nPeople \npraying \nbehind \nan \nImam \nshould \nrecite \nto \nthemselves when he recites to himself  \n \nIt is related that this means that the judgment of the one \nfollowing the Imam is that it is recommended for him to recite \nwith the Imam in what the Imam says silently. That is since lack \nof recitation is a means to thinking and whispering.  \n \n11.1l When the Imam recites aloud  \n \nbut should not recite with him when he recites out loud \n  \nIt is disliked to recite when he recites out loud, even if he cannot \nhear his voice, according to the text. If he recites with him, what \nhe has done is bad, but his prayer is not invalidated. The basis for \nthis is the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"When the Qur'an is \nrecited, then listen to it and be silent.\" Shaikh al-Bayhaqi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported from Mujahid (radhi’Allahu \nanhu) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was reciting \nin the prayer and he heard one of the Ansar reciting, and then the \nwords of Allah azza wa jall were revealed: \"When the Qur'an is \nrecited, then listen to it and be silent.\" They related it from \nMujahid (radhi’Allahu anhu) from another path that he said it \nwas during the khutba on Friday, and another path has the \nprayer and the khutba.  \n \n11.2 Late-comer making up missed prayer  \n \n11.2a Catching the prayer  \n \nIf you catch one or more rak'ats of a group prayer then it is \nas if you have caught the whole prayer \n  \nIf you catch one or more rak'ats of the obligatory prayer or another \nprayer prescribed in a group like the „Ids, with the Imam, is \njudged to have caught the prayer. The Muwatta' has the words of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \"Whoever catches a \nrak'at of the prayer had caught the prayer,\" i.e. he is obliged what \nis obliged of the Imam in the prostration of forgetfulness. He does \nnot follow anyone else nor repeat his prayer in another group. He \nsays the salam to the Imam and to the one of his left and he \nobtains a reward similar to the reward of those who were present \nfrom its beginning. It is 27 degrees higher. This is when he misses \nthe rest of it by necessity, not from choice. Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he obtains the excellence of the \ngroup. It is the literal meaning of the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and agrees with its explanation.  \n \nWhat we said indicates catching one rak'at of the ikhtiyari time is \nin the position of catching all the prayer in negating the sin, even \nif he delays the ikhtiyari. Also no one said that one who misses \npart of the prayer with the Imam repeats it to obtain the benefits \nof the group. This is clear in the rest of his words. “Catching the \nrak'at with the Imam\" is by placing the hands on the knees, \nmeaning he bows over so that if he wanted to place his hands on \nhis knees, he could certainly do that and the Imam would not rise \nfrom ruku' before he placed his hands on his knees.  \n \nThe judgment of the one who misses a rak'at or more with the \nImam is that he performs what he missed with the Imam.  \n \n11.2b Making up the missed recitation  \n \nYou then make up the rak'ats you have missed after the \nImam has said the salam, making your recitation in them \nout loud or silent in the way that the Imam did \n  \nWhat the Imam recited of the Fatiha and the sura, he recites as \nthe Imam recited: what he did silently he does silently and what \nhe did out loud, he does out loud. If he sits in the place, he is \npermitted to sit, even if he is alone, by catching two rak'ats, then \nhe stands with a takbir. If he sits in a place where it is not \npermitted to sit, even if alone, by catching one or three rak'ats \nwith him, he stands without a takbir. It is the famous position as \nopposed to Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is as \nhe thought that the takbir is for moving to a pillar of the prayer. \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of at-Tiraz mentioned from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-'Utibiyya the position that \nif he sits in the second, he stands without a takbir. He said that it \nis based on the fact that he is making up the two previous ones \nand that which begins the first is the takbir al-ihram.  \n \n11.2c Making up other actions  \n \nThe other aspects of the prayer such as your standing and \nsitting are done as if you were continuing a prayer you had \nstarted by yourself \n  \nHe builds on what he has done. He prays like someone who prays \nuntil the end of his prayer and then remembers that he has \nmissed some of the prayer. This has three forms because he either \nremembers what would invalidate one, two or three rak'ats by \nomitting prostration, recitation of the Fatiha or something else \nwhich would invalidate the prayer.  \n \n11.3 Repeating the Prayer  \n \nIf you have already done the prayer by yourself you can do \nit again with a group in order to get the benefit there is in \ndoing that  \n \n If you have prayed the obligatory prayer alone outside one of the \nthree masjids (Makka, Madina and al-Aqsa), where there is no \nregular Imam and the Iqama was not given while you were in the \nmasjid, it is recommended that you repeat what he prayed in the \ngroup, even in the daruri time. The repeating is for the sake of the \nexcellence of the group which is limited by not being outside of the \ntime of the prayer. If it is outside of the time of the prayer, it is not \nrepeated.  \n \nThe group consists of two and more, and so there is no repeating \nwith one until he is a regular Imam.  \n \nIf the iqama of the prayer is called while someone is in the masjid, \nhe joins it. The Mudawwana states: \"If anyone hears the iqama \nand has already prayed alone, it is not obligatory for him to repeat \nit unless he wishes, even if he is in a masjid which he has entered \nwith the Imam. The intention of the one who has prayed alone \nwho repeats it in the group is to obtain the excellence reported in \nthat by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The group \nprayer is 27 degrees better than the pray alone.\" The prayer which \nis repeated for the excellence of the group is general in every \nobligatory prayer.  \n \n11.3b The case of Maghrib  \n \nexcept in the case of Maghrib \n  \nIf he were to repeat it with the Imam, he bows an even number, \nand does it as nafila. If he does not remember until he has prayed \nthree with him, when the Imam says the salam, he does a fourth \nafter it as nafila. If he does not remember until he has prayed \nwith the Imam, he does not repeat it. It is also said that he does \nnot repeat it. He is not asked to repeat Maghrib for the group \nbecause if it is repeated, it becomes even. Maghrib is three so that \nthe number of rak'ats of the day and night will be odd. According \nto the words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi), he repeats Isha', \neven if he has done the witr. The well-known position is that it is \nnot repeated if he has done the witr for the joining of the two witrs \nin the night according to one of two statements by Shaikh Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he repeats the witr when he repeats \n'Isha'.  \n \n11.3c Only one group prayer  \n \nIf you have caught one rak'at or more of a group prayer \nthen you should not do that prayer again with another \ngroup \n  \n i.e. it is forbidden for him, even if the second group is greater in \nnumber that more excellent. It is the well-known position, i.e. \nbecause the excellence for which repeating is prescribed has been \nobtained, even if the prayer begins with the excellent, and the \nlarge group is better. However, this excellence is not prescribed for \nthe sake of repetition. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"The excellence of the group is have number and the \nexcellence of the Imam is based on what is stated by the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The prayer of a man with \nanother man is better than his prayer alone, and his prayer with \ntwo men is better than his prayer with one man, and what is more \nis more beloved to Allah azza wa jall,\" i.e. wherever he is, that is \nthe case. So this would mean whoever prays with a group should \nrepeat it with a better group, or the one who prayed with an Imam \nshould repeat it with a better Imam. This is not what is meant \nand it is not what is meant in the hadith. This hadith indicates \nthe encouragement to pray in a group or in large group. Then the \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) explains what is understood by his \nwords, to make it clearer.  \n \n11.3d When it is allowed  \n \nBut if you have only caught the sujud or the tashahhud \nthen you can, if you want, do that prayer again with \nanother group \n  \nHe can choose between two things: either building on his ihram or \nstopping and joining another group if he hopes to catch it. If he \ndoes not hope to catch it, then he completes his prayer and does \nnot stop it. This is in respect of the one who has not prayed before \nthat. As for the one who has prayed before that, and not caught \nthe group prayer except for this amount, he does two, i.e. it is \ndesirable after the salam of the Imam. He does two when the \nprayer is one after which nafila is permitted, as in at-Tata'i. \nAccording to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), he \nabsolutely stops, whether he began the prayer with the intention \nof the fard or nafila, i.e. after the two rakat‟s, and does not \ncomplete his prayer.  \n \nOpposite that is what Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in \nal-Mabsut about his intention when he joined the Imam was to \nmake it Dhuhr with four and his prayer at home nafila, then he \nmust complete it and it is up to Allah azza wa jall to make the \nfard whichever of them He wishes. If he does not mean to negate \nthe first, then the first is adequate and he does not have to \ncomplete this one.  \n \n11.4 Positions behind an Imam  \n \nThen there are six positions regarding someone following the \nImam regarding whether he is alone, or other men or women are \nwith him. \n  \n11.4a Two men  \n \nIf there is just one man with the Imam he stands on the \nImam's right \n  \nIf there is one man or a child who understands the prayer, i.e. \ngrasps that obedience is rewarded and disobedience is punished. \nOtherwise he is only a child. It is desirable for such a person to \nstand with the Imam to his right and a little bit behind him so \nthat the Imam can be distinguished from the follower. It is \ndisliked to be level. The fact that his place is to the right is based \non what is in the Sahih that Ibn 'Abbas (radhi’Allahu anhu) \nsaid, \"I spent the night in the house of my aunt, Maymuna \n(radhi’Allahu anha) and the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) rose to pray and I stood at his left and he moved me with \nhis hand behind his back to the right side.  \n \n11.4b Two men or more men  \n \nTwo men or more stand behind the Imam \n  \nThis is based on what is in Sahih Muslim where Jabir \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) said, \"The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) stood to pray and I went and stood at the left of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) and he took my hand and brought \nme round to stand at his right Then Jabir ibn Sakhr \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) came and stood at the left of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) and he took our hands and pushed \nus until he had us stand behind him.\"  \n \n11.4c Women  \n \nIf there is a woman there as well she stands behind the \nmen \n  \nIf there a woman, she stands behind the men because of what is in \nSahih Muslim where Anas (radhi’Allahu anhu) said, \"When I \nwas an orphan in our house, I prayed behind the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and Umm Sulaym (radhi’Allahu anha) \nwas behind us.\"  \n \n11.4d A man and a woman following the Imam  \n \nIf there is just one man and a woman praying with the \nImam, the man stands on the Imam's right and the woman \nstands behind them \n  \nThe man, or the child who understands the act of worship, stands \nto the right and the woman stands behind them based on what \nAnas (radhi’Allahu anhu) said where the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) prayed with him and his mother or aunt and he \n(alaihi salat wa salam) made him stand to his right the woman \nbehind him. The judgment regarding a group of women with the \nImam is the same of a man is with one woman with them. That is \nindicated in the chapter of Jumu'a where he says that the women \nshould be behind the rows of men.  \n \n11.4e A man and a woman  \n \nIf a man prays with his wife, she stands behind him \n  \nQadi ibn al-'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the clearest in it \nis that the husband is like the man. Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Dwell, you and your wife, in the Garden.\" She does not stand to \nhis right, meaning it is disliked for to her do that. He should \nindicate to her to go back but the prayer of neither is invalidated \nby being level unless there is invalidation by impurity. \n  \n11.4f A boy and man  \n \nA young boy with a man stand side by side behind the \nImam as long as the boy is sensible enough not to run off \nand leave the man he is standing with on his own \n  \nWhen there is a child and a man, they stand behind the Imam \nbased on the previous hadith of Anas (radhi’Allahu anhu), but it \nis limited by the people of the Madhhab to when the boy is \nsensible and he understands the reward of the one who completes \nthe prayer and the wrong action of the one who stops. If the boy \ndoes not understand what was mentioned, the man stands to the \nright of the Imam and the child is left to stand wherever he \nwishes. \n  \nThe judgment of these ranks is that it is recommended. Whoever \ndisagrees with the order and prays otherwise has nothing against \nhim unless that the woman goes forward to the rank of the man or \nin front of the Imam. It is like a man who goes ahead of the \nImam–that is disliked without excuse. When a woman goes in \nfront of the Imam, his prayer is not invalidated nor the prayer of \nanyone with him unless he takes pleasure in looking at her or \ntouching her. The statement that it is invalid by pleasure or \nlooking is weak since there is no touching nor ejaculation. If the \none following an Imam goes in front because of an excuse, like the \nlack of space in the masjid, it is permitted for him without dislike. \n  \n11.5 The Imam's single prayer  \n \n11.5a The Imam's prayer is a group prayer  \n \nThe prayer of the regular Imam when he is alone is \nconsidered as a group prayer \n  \nThe regular Imam is the one who is appointed by the ruler or his \nrepresentative or the waqif (trustee) or group of Muslims in any \npermitted or disliked manner because the precondition of the \nwaqif demands that he be followed, even if he is disliked. It is like \nthat with the ruler or his representative, even if they command \nsomething disliked in one of two positions. It is the same whether \nthe position of the Imamate is in an actual masjid or is a \njudgment, and thus ships are included in it, and any place in \nwhich there is normally a group prayer. \n  \nOn his own he is considered to achieve the group prayer in its \nexcellence and judgment. Therefore another group prayer is not \nrepeated and it is not held in that masjid again. Whoever prays \nalone repeats it with him, but with the precondition that the \nprayer is within its normal time and people expect it normally, \nwith the intention of the Imam, the adhan and the iqama. He can \njoin prayers alone on the night of rain because the difficulty in \nrespect of it and he says, \"Allah hears whoever praises him,\" and \ndoes not add, \"Our Lord, praise is yours,\" i.e. that is disliked. \n  \n11.5b No two prayers in the masjid  \n \nIt is disliked for there to be two group prayers for any one \nprayer in any masjid that has a regular Imam \n  \nBefore, after or with the regular Imam according to the position of \nthe school that it is unlawful for anyone to pray the prayer while \nthe regular Imam is praying it, alone or in a group, because that \nwould lead to mutual hate and dispute between the Imams and \nthe splitting of the community whereas the Shari‟ah commands \nharmony. \n  \n11.5c If someone has already prayed he cannot be Imam \n  \nAnyone who has already prayed a particular prayer cannot \nthen be the Imam for that same prayer for anyone else \n  \nAnyone who has prayed an obligatory prayer alone or in a group, \nas Imam or following, cannot lead that prayer which he repeats. It \nis known from the Madhhab that it is not permitted for someone \ndoing a fard prayer to follow someone doing a voluntary one and is \nrepeating that in which he led a group if they wish, which is the \napproved position of the school, or individuals. Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says \"individuals\" and it seems that he \nnoted the Madhhab of the opponent because the first prayer is \nallowed by Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. \nWhen they repeat it in a group, they become like the one who \nprayed in a group and then repeated in another group.  \n \n11.6 How to follow the Imam  \n \n11.6a Following the Imam in the sujud of forgetfulness  \n \nIf the Imam leaves out something in his prayer and does \nthe sujud of forgetfulness those behind him follow him \neven though they themselves have not left anything out \n  \nIt is obligatory that the one following follow him, even if he did it \nbefore him. The question has different cases. If he caught all the \nprayer with him, he is obliged to follow him in every aspect, \nwhether prostration before or after. If he preceded him, then he \nmust either have a rak'at with him or not. If he had a rak'at with \nhim and his prostration is before, then he prostrates with him. If \nit is after, he does not prostate with him and waits for him sitting, \naccording to what is in the Mudawwana. They said that he is \nsilent and does not say that tashahhud with him. If he differs \nand prostrates, then his prayer is invalid. If he is ignorant, \nShaikh 'Isa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he always repeats it. \nHe said in al-Bayan, and it is the most comparable on the basis of \nthe Madhhab is that it is because he has introduced into the \nprayer what is not part of it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) has excused it when it is ignorance and says that its \njudgment is that of forgetfulness to observe the one who says that \nhe used to prostrate with the Imam. \n  \nIf he does not do a rak'at with him, he does not consequently \nprostrate afterwards. As for the prostration before, Shaikh \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he does not \nfollow him. If he differs and follows him, then his prayer is \ninvalid, whether intentional or by ignorance, not by \noversight. The basis is in what ad-Daraqutni (radhi’Allahu \nanhu) reported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"There is no oversight against the person following the \nImam. If the Imam forgets, then it is against him and whoever \nfollows him.\" In the two Sahih collections is that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The Imam is made to be followed in \nthe states of the prayer.\"  \n \n11.6b Not preceding the Imam  \n \nNo one should raise their head before the Imam nor do any \nof the actions of the prayer until he has done them \n  \nNone of those following the Imam precedes him in ruku', \nprostration or anything else. If he gets ahead of him, he returns to \nhim thinking to catch him before rising. Is returning Sunnah or \nobligatory? Shaikh al-Mawwaq (rahmatullahi alaihi) confined \nhimself to the second and even if he fails to return, his prayer is \nvalid since he took his obligation with the Imam before he rose. \nOtherwise, it is obligatory for him to return. If he omits it \nintentionally or by ignorance, then his prayer is invalid, but \nnot by oversight. It is in the position of the one who is crowded \nand it is an analogy with the lowering.  \n \nNot going down before the Imam is based on what is in the Sahih \ncollections that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Does not the one who raises his head before the Imam fear that \nAllah will transform his face into that of a donkey or make his \nform the form of a donkey?\" In the variant of Sahih Muslim is that \nhe said, \"O people! I am your Imam so do not precede me in \nbowing, prostration, standing or leaving.  \n \nYou only do something after he has begun to do it. It is better to \ndo it after he has begun it and to catch him in it. This is outside of \nthe standing up after two rak'ats. In the rak'at, he must not do it \nuntil the Imam is already standing. The basis for that is that \nShaikh al-Bara' (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"When the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, 'Allah hears whoever praises \nHim,' none of them moved his back, i.e. stood up until the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) had gone into prostration. Then \nwe went into prostration after him,\" i.e. they delayed beginning \ntheir action from when he began it and they begin their action \nbefore he finished his prostration. The commentator of the hadith \nsaid, \"It is forbidden to precede the Imam and to do it at the same \ntime as him, and it is disliked to delay until he moves on to \nanother pillar of the prayer. It is also said that accompanying him \nis disliked.  \n \n11.6c Beginning the prayer behind the Imam  \n \nYou begin the prayer after he has begun it \n  \nThe one following begins the prayer with the takbir after the \nImam has said it. This is obligatory. This is after he finishes \nsaying the takbir. If he says it before him or at the same \ntime as him, then his prayer is invalid, whether he concludes \nit before him, with him, or after him. There are six forms of this. If \nhe begins after him and ends before him, it is invalid, and if \nhe ends with him or after him, it is sound. So the forms are \nnine. The same applies to the salam, although in the case of \ntahrim, there is no difference between the intentional and the \noversight. In the case of the salam, it is confined to the \nintentional, not to oversight. So his prayer is not invalid by that \nsalam.  \n \nNote: When he knows that he has said the tahrim before the \nImam and wants to say it after him, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that he says the takbir and not the salam because it is \nas if he has not said the takbir by his disagreement from what he \nwas commanded. Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nhe says the salam because he disagrees about the validity of the \nfirst tahrim.  \n \n11.6d Standing up  \n \nstand up after two rak'ats after he has stood up  \n \ni.e. it is recommended to stand after the Imam is completely \nstanding.  \n \n11.6e The Salam  \n \nand say the salam after he has said the salam \n  \nThis is obligatory. If he says it before him or at the same time, \nthen his prayer is invalid, unless he starts from forgetfulness. \nOtherwise, he waits until the Imam says the salam and then says \nthe salam after him.  \n \n11.6f Other actions  \n \nAs for any other of the actions of the prayer, it is \nacceptable to do them at the same time as the Imam but it \nis better to do them after him \n  \ni.e. other than beginning, standing up from two rak'ats, and the \nsalam. These are like going down into ruku', prostration, standing \nfor the second and the fourth. It is permitted to do them at the \nsame time, even though it is disliked, as is shown by the fact that \nhe says, \"it is better.\"  \n \n11.6g Omissions by the follower  \n \nIf anything is left out (sahw) by someone praying behind \nan Imam, the responsibility for it is borne by the Imam \n  \nThis is like the takbir and the words of the tashahhud or adding a \nsajda or ruku'. There is no understanding of oversight, and it \nincludes some intentionality, like omitting the takbir or the \ntashahhud. That is while he is following the Imam. If he arrived \nlate and forgets while making up what the missed with the Imam, \nthe Imam is not responsible for it because following has ended and \nhis judgment is that of someone praying alone. Then there are \nexceptions which he mentioned:  \n \n11.6h Exceptions  \n \nexcept if it is something like not going into ruku' [Lit. like \nthe rak'at] or sujud or leaving out the \"Allahu Akbar\" that \nbegins the prayer (takbirat al-ihram) or the salam at the \nend or neglecting to make the intention for that specific \nprayer \n  \n\"Like the rak'at\" means all that is obligatory except for the Fatiha, \nand the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not enumerate it. That is \nbecause all of these are obligations and the obligations do not fall \naside by forgetfulness and are not made up by prostration.  \n \n11.6i A meritorious action: the Imam changing his position \nafter the prayer  \n \nThe Imam should not stay in the same place after he has \nsaid the salam but should move away  \n \nWhen the Imam has said the salam for the obligatory prayer, he \nshould not remain where he is, whether the prayer is nafila or not, \nbut should move. It is clear in the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he moves. What is meant is not that he \nleaves the mihrab. What is meant is to move to the right or left. \nShaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is enough that \nhe change his place. Shaikh ath-Tha'labi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"This is the Sunnah.\"  \n \nThere is disagreement about the reason for it. It is said that he \nonly deserves the place for the sake of the prayer. When he \nfinishes, he does not deserve it. It is said that the reason is to \navoid confusion for the one who arrives. It is transmitted from \nImam ash-Shafi‟i RA) that he stays firm a little after the salam \nbased on what is in the Sahih of Muslim that when he said the \nsalam, he only sat for as long as to say, \"O Allah, You are the \nPeace and peace is from You. You are blessed, O You with Majesty \nand Honor.\"  \n \nThen he makes an exception about the Imam moving his place \nafter the salam: \n  \n11.6j An exception \n  \nexcept if he is in his own place in which case he can do \neither  \n \nThis means his house while he is resident or his mount while \ntraveling or if he is in some wasteland. It is permitted for him \nwithout dislike because he is safe from what might be feared in \nthat.  \n \nPoint: Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and a group of scholars \ndisliked for the Imams of the masjids and groups to make \nsupplication out loud after the obligatory prayers for those who \nare present so as to convey precedence and honor for this Imam \nand establishing him as a medium between Allah azza wa jall and \nHis servants to obtain their best interests through him in \nsupplication. Thus he is on the verge of exalting himself and his \nheart will be corrupted and he will disobey his Lord in this state \nmore than obeying Him. It is related that one of the Imams asked \n'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu) for permission to make \nsupplication for his people after the prayer and he replied, \"No, I \nfear that you will become arrogant until you reach for the Pleads!\"  \n \n \n \nChapter Twelve: On Various Aspects of the \nPrayer \n \n \nThis deals with various topics which go beyond the prayer, like the \none who is certain about wudu' and uncertain about breaking it, \nthe one who cannot touch water by necessity or does not find \nanyone to bring it to him who does tayammum.  \n \n12.1 Clothing in the prayer  \n \n12.1a Minimum Clothing for a woman  \n \nThe least amount of clothing in which is acceptable for a \nwoman to do the prayer is a robe which cannot be seen \nthrough which is long enough to cover the tops of her feet \nand a head covering through which the hair cannot be \nseen \n  \nTwo things are necessary: a robe, and the descriptive words means \neither thick or enveloping. According to the second, it should be \nample so that it covers the tops of the her feet.  \n \nThe second item is a head covering. It is a garment with which a \nwoman covers her head. Its precondition is the same as the long \ngarment, in that it has to be thick and not transparent. If she \nprays in something which is lightly woven and transparent, and it \nis something which shows the 'awra without thinking, then she \nalways repeats the prayer. If it only defines the 'awra, it is \ndisliked and she repeats it within the time. The man is like the \nwoman in that. So the woman must cover the top and soles of her \nfeet and her neck and her hair. She is permitted to only show \nher face and palms in the prayer. The basis for that is the \nwords of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"Allah does not \naccept the prayer of a woman who has reached the age of \nmenstruation except with a head covering\" In one variant, \"The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was asked, \"Can a woman \npray in a robe and head covering without a waist-wrapper?\" He \nsaid, \"If the robe is ample and covers the tops of her feet.\" \n  \n12.1b Minimum Clothing for a Man  \n \nThe least which is acceptable for a man is a single garment \n  \nWithout dislike if it is thick and conceals all his body. If it only \ncovers his private parts, then his prayer is allowed but there is \ndislike.  \n \n12.1c What should not be covered  \n \nYou should not cover your nose or your face in the prayer  \n \nNeither a man nor woman should cover the face in the prayer. All \nthese things which are prohibited are disliked.  \n \n12.1d Gathering clothes and tying back hair \n  \nnor should you gather up your clothes or tie back your \nhair especially for it \n  \nAs for gathering up the clothes, it is disliked when it is done \nspecifically for the prayer or because of fear that clothes might get \ndirty because that contains a form of non-humility. When he is \nworking and the time for the prayer comes while he is like that, he \nis permitted to pray with what he has on without dislike.  \n \nAs for tying back the hair, it is disliked if that is in order to keep \nthe hair from becoming dirtied by the earth or he does that for the \nprayer, i.e. ties his hair for the especially prayer .  \n \n12.2 Prostration on account of a mistake  \n \n12.2a Adding to the prayer  \n \nAny time you inadvertently add something to the prayer \nyou should do two sajdas after saying the salam and then \ndo the tashahhud and say the salam again \n  \nThis is whenever the Imam, the one on his own or the one \nfollowing makes a mistake in one of the suras or in what is \nprescribed for him in the obligatory or nafila prayer, according to \nwhat is in the Mudawwana as opposed to the one who said that \nthere is no prostration in the nafila. Our evidence is in the words \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"There are two \nprostration‟s for every forgetfulness.\" The result is that the nafila \nis like the obligatory except in five questions, silent and out loud: \nthe sura is overlooked in the nafila rather than the obligatory. The \nfourth is when he raises his head from ruku', he completes it as a \nfourth in the nafila as opposed to the fard. The fifth is when he \nforgets a pillar of the nafila, and a long time has passed or he has \nbegun an obligatory prayer or nafila, and has bowed - he does not \nhave do anything, as opposed to the fard, which he must repeat.  \n \nIf you add something, whether outside the words of the prayer, \nlike speaking inadvertently, or an action of the prayer, like bowing \nand prostrating, you prostrate for the forgetfulness in the Sunnah \naccording to what is in the Mukhtasar and in at-Tiraz as the \nobligation of doing it afterwards. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that.  \n \n12.2b Only two prostration’s  \n \nHe does the two prostration‟s after the salam, even if there is more \nthan one oversight as long as it is not a lot. Otherwise the prayer \nwould be invalid whether it is from other than the words of the \nprayer, like speech out of forgetfulness and is lengthy. If it is part \nof the words of the prayer, there is not prostration for saying it \nforgetfully, as the prayer is not invalid if it is intentional, as when \nhe repeats the sura or adds a sura at the end of it, unless the \nwords are a fard. Then he would prostrate for forgetfulness. This \nis like when he repeats the Fatiha out of forgetfulness, even in the \nsame rak'at. There is disagreement about whether the prayer is \ninvalidated by deliberately reciting it. The accepted position is \nthat it is not invalid.  \n \nOr he may add something which is not one of the actions of the \nprayer, as when he forgets that he is praying and eats and drinks. \nThere is disagreement about that and it is said that all of them \ninvalidates the prayer, whether a lot or not. It is said that if it is a \nlot, it invalidates, and otherwise it does not and is put right by the \nprostration.  \n \nOr it can be one of the actions of the prayer when there is a lot of \nit in the four rak'ats, like the four actual rak'ats based on what is \nwell-known from Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nthose who follow him. The rak'at is considered to be rising from \nruku'. When he raises his head from the second in four, or the first \nin three or four in two, then the prayer is invalid. There are two \npositions about whether it is invalid by half of it. It is said that it \nis invalid, and it is said that it is not, and that is the accepted \nposition. He prostrates for forgetfulness.  \n \nA lot in two is like two rak'ats. It is not invalidated by adding one \nrak'at in the famous position, like the two of Subh and Jumu'a, \nbased on its being fard in its day. Opposite it is that it is only \ninvalid by adding four rak'ats. It is like the four while traveling. \nThey are not invalid except by adding four rak'ats. A lot in \nMaghrib is four rak'ats in the approved position that three is like \nfour and its not invalidated except by adding four complete \nrak'ats.  \n \n12.2c Missing out something  \n \nIf you miss something out of the prayer you should do two \nsajdas before saying the salam after having finished the \ntashahhud. You then do the tashahhud again and say the \nsalam.  \n \nThere is the case when the Imam or the one alone or the one \nfollowing omit something which is a confirmed Sunnah, or the two \nminor Sunnah‟s, whether it is an actual decrease or uncertain one. \nThe confirmed Sunnah‟s are those for which there are \nprostration‟s are eight:  \n \nRecitation of more than the Fatiha in the fard, and so he \nprostrates for omitting that in the fard, but not in a nafila.  \n \nReciting out loud in the prayers which are out loud, and he \nprostrates for omitting that in the fard, not the nafila since he can \ndo them silently.  \n \nDoing it silently in its place. When he recites out loud in the place \nof the silent, he prostrates before the salam. This is related from \nthe opinion of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), but it is \nweak. What is approved is that it is after the salam.  \n \nA takbir other than the takbir al-ihram. This is based on all of \nthem being one sunnah. As for the statement that each takbir is a \nsunnah, which is what the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of al-\nMukhtasar says and is stated in al-Mudawwana as well, he \nprostrates for omitting two takbirs.  \n \nThe words, \"Allah hears whoever praises Him.\" It is applies as \nwhat is before it does.  \n \nThe first tashahhud and sitting for it. It is one Sunnah, and its \nwords are one Sunnah, and the sitting for it is another Sunnah, \nand so it is composed of three Sunnah‟s.  \n \nThe final tashahhud.  \n \nThere is no prostration for other than these eight and the \nprostration before the salam is after the tashahhud. Then you \nfinish the two prostration‟s and do the tashahhud a second time in \nthe well-known position and then say the salam. It is preferred by \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and he stated that part \nof the sunnah of the salam is that it follows the tashahhud. His \nwords imply that he does not repeat the prayer on the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam). That is the case.]  \n \n12.2d Not repeating the tashahhud  \n \nSome people say that it is not necessary to repeat the \ntashahhud \n  \nThat is also related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nShaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred it because \nthe method of one sitting does not have the tashahhud repeated in \nit twice.  \n \n12.2e Both omitting and adding  \n \nIf you both leave something out and add something you do \nthe two sajdas before the salam \n  \nIf you leave out some of the confirmed sunnah‟s and add \nsomething insignificant which was already clarified, then the \nprostration is also done before the salam, for instance, if he omits \nthe tashahhud and sitting for it and adds a prostration. What the \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned about prostrating only for \nomission first with the increase after the salam and prostrating \nonly for increase after the salam is the position of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Imam Ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat he absolutely prostrates before the salam and Imam Abu \nHanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says absolutely after it. Our evidence \nfor the increase is that it is true that once he (SAW) prayed 'Asr \nand said the salam after two rak'ats. Dhu'l-Yadayn (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) stood up and said, \"Has the prayer been shortened, \nRasulullah? Or have you forgotten?\" The Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) stood up and did the rest of the prayer and then did two \nprostration‟s after the salam while sitting,  \n \nThe evidence for the omission is that it is confirmed that he (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) prayed Dhuhr and stood after the first two rak'ats \nwithout sitting. The people stood up with him. When he finished \nthe prayer, people waited for the salam, but he said the takbir \nwhile sitting. He did two prostration‟s before the salam and then \nsaid it. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"Decrease overcomes increase when they are together.\" The hadith \ncontains an indication of the prescription of the prostration for \nforgetfulness - it is two prostration‟s. The taslim done forgetfully \ndoes not invalidate the prayer. A slight gap after it does not \ninvalidate it. Words of no use by the Imam and the one following \ndo not invalidate the prayer.  \n \n12.2f Forgetting to do the prostration of forgetfulness \nbefore  \n \nIf you forget to do the two sajdas which should be done \nafter the salam you do them whenever you remember them \neven if a long time has elapsed \n  \nThe prostration of forgetfulness which are after the salam should \nbe done afterwards, even if it is a long time after the salam of the \nprayer, even after a month. The prostration afterwards is to spite \nShaitan. So it is appropriate that he prostrate, even later.  \n \n12.2g Forgetting to do the prostration of forgetfulness \nbefore  \n \nIf you forget to do the two sajdas which should be done \nbefore the salam \n  \nAs for the one before, it mends the omission in the prayer and \nshould be in it or close after it. His words in the Mudawwana is \nthat he does it, even if it is in the time which it is forbidden. If he \nremembers it in a prayer which is not obligatory in the time of \nprohibition, he delays it until the nafila. It is also clear that it if it \nis a consequence of the Jumu'a prayer, he does not return to the \nmasjid. The school, according to Shaikh at-Tadili (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), is that he returns to the masjid. The literal text of the \nMukhtasar is that it is particular to returning to the masjid for \nthe prostration before rather than the one after it. It is the \napproved position. This is the literal text of the Mukhtasar \nbecause he says, \"in the masjid in the Jumu'a\" in the context of \nthe words about the prostration before.  \n \nThe prostration before must be done in the masjid in which the \nJumu'a was performed if he misses the first rak'at of Jumu'a and \nrises to finish it and forgets the sura and leaves the masjid and a \nlong time has not passed. He returns to the masjid in which he \nprayed Jumu'a. As for the one afterwards, if when he speaks out of \nforgetfulness or adds a rak'at by forgetfulness and forgets to \nprostrate until he has left the masjid, he can prostrate in any \nmasjid.  \n \n12.2h Doing the two prostration’s later  \n \nthen you do them straight away so long as the prayer is not \nlong over \n  \nThis is when you remember them shortly after finishing the \nprayer - and this shortness is not defined according to the School. \nIt is the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). It \nis like that with length. One consults custom. Whatever the \ncustom is acted on in them. According to Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), it is defined by not having left the masjid. \n  \n12.2i After a long time  \n \nIf quite some time has elapsed, however, you have to do the \nprayer again  \n \nIf it is a long time, then he repeats the prayer. This is obligatory \nbecause it is invalid since it is a result of omitting three sunnah‟s. \nShaikh at-Tata‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is like forgetting the \nmiddle sitting, or three takbirs. This is if he omitted them by \nforgetfulness. If he left them deliberately, the prayer is invalid by \nsimply omitting them according to Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh as-Sanhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is \nonly invalid by length, even if he omits them deliberately.  \n \n12.2j Minor omissions  \n \nunless what you left out was not particularly critical such \nas only the sura which should follow the Fatiha or two \ntakbirs or saying the tashahhuds or similar things  \n \ni.e. it consists of two slight sunnah‟s like being silent or out loud, \ni.e. he prostrates for them, but when he omits that and a long time \npasses, his prayer is not invalid. This is when he comes to \nundertake it. Otherwise, it is invalid in this case because he \nomitted three sunnah‟s. It is said that it is not invalid. If he does \nnot do the standing for it. The words of Shaikh al-Jazuli \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) are useful in preferring the first. It is agreed \nthat it is invalid since he left a sura in more than one rak'at. \nWhen the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, \"only the sura which \nshould follow the Fatiha\", even after the Fatiha, it is clearer so \nthat it will not be imagined that the Fatiha is also omitted. \n\"Similar things\" are like the two praises. This is permitted as a \nmercy from Allah in the prevailing position, based on the fact that \nthe specific expression is desirable. If he omits the two \ntashahhuds and sits for them because in that case his prostration \nis only for two slight sunnah‟s.  \n \n12.2k When nothing is obliged  \n \nin which case you need not do anything \n  \ni.e. he does not have to repeat the prayer nor prostrate, i.e. even \nafter a period of time, since it is the subject of the question of the \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is known that the two slight \nsunnah‟s are prostrated for, but when a long time has passed, and \nhe does not prostrate, he is not asked to prostrate or to repeat the \nprayer since it is for two slight sunnah‟s. I know from what \npreceded that the prostration is prescribed to mend the gaps \nwhich occur in the prayer as if there is an extra ruku' or \nprostration through forgetfulness, or the omission of ruku' or \nprostration by forgetfulness, he repairs that omission before the \nsalam. If he omits a confirmed Sunnah or two slight sunnah‟s, he \nmust prostrate according to its circumstances, before or after to \nrepair those gaps. There are gaps which occur in the prayer which \nare not mended by prostration, i.e. the prostration does not \nreplace them - this is when he omits a pillar of the prayer.'  \n \n12.2l When they are not sufficient  \n \nThe two sajdas of forgetfulness are not sufficient to make \nup for missing out one full rak'at or sujud or failing to \nrecite the Fatiha in two rak'ats of any prayer (or, in case of \nSubh, one rak'at) \n  \ni.e. a full rak'at which he is certain that he omitted or is unsure of \nit during his tashahhud and before his salam. Then he must \nperform that rak'at. The manner in which he does is that he does \nit, building on the preceding rak'ats, even if that rak'at, is one of \ntwo, and he prostrates after that for the one before the salam \nbecause of moving one of the rak'ats since he is Imam or alone. If \nit is not one of two, then he prostrates after the salam after he \ndoes the rak'at for the increase, not the decrease.  \n \nIf he omits a prostration or ruku' or rising from them and \nremembers that while he is standing, for instance, or doing the \nfinal tashahhud when he realizes his omission or is unsure about \nit, and it is not possible to satisfy the fard in its place, then he \ndoes the unsure substitution and prostrates before the salam \nbecause the obligation in prostration is before. What is meant by \ndoubt is hesitation and so it includes supposition, doubt, and \nuncertainty. This is in respect of obligations because doubt in \ndecrease in them is like realizing it in the obligation of bringing \nthe unsure substitute as opposed to the sunnah‟s. He does not \nprostrate for omitting them except when he is certain of missing \nthem or it is equally balanced in his mind whether he did it or \nnote.  \n \nIn cases of failing to recite, he mentions that if someone misses \nout an obligation or pillar, he performs it, and what he mentioned \nof lack of mending by prostration for missing out a rak'at or \nprostration is agreed upon. What he mentioned of lack of mending \nby prostration for omitting the recitation of the Fatiha in the \nentire prayer is the position of the majority, and it is preferred. \nOpposite it is what Shaikh al-Waqidi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related \nfrom Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that when recitation is \nomitted in the entire prayer, his prayer is allowed.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that there are three \npositions about omitting recitation in half of the prayer, like one \nrak'at of a two rak'at prayer and two of a four rak'at prayer. The \nbest known is that he continues and prostates before the salam \nand it is desirable that he repeat his prayer in order to be careful. \nThe second is that he prostrates before the salam and it is enough \nfor him. The third is that what he omitted of the recitation \nnullifies and he does the like of it and prostrates after the salam. \nThis is what happens in the accepted position that it is obligatory \nin every rak'at. So it is accepted. Having clarified this point, he \nmoves on to its minimum omission:  \n \n12.2m Missing the Fatiha in one rak'at  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion about what you should do \nif you miss out the Fatiha in one rak'at in any prayer apart \nfrom Subh. Some people say that you only have to do the \ntwo sajdas before the salam; others say that the whole \nrak'at is invalidated and that you must do another rak'at to \nmake up for it; yet others say that you do the two sajdas \nbefore the salam without doing another rak'at but then \nrepeat the whole prayer to make sure of being correct \n  \nThis is like one rak'at of a three or four rak'at prayer. There are \nthree positions, all of which are in the Mudawwana. One is that \nthe forgetfulness in recitation is satisfied by the prostration as \nlong as it is not Subh. It does not invalidate it and satisfies it. \nShaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred this position \nbased on the fact that it is fard in the majority or based on the fact \nthat it is not obligation or that it is obligatory in one or half of the \nrak'ats.  \n \nThe second is that the rak'at from which the Fatiha was omitted is \ninvalid and he must do another rak'at to replace it. Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers this statement. This \nnecessitates that it is obligatory in every rak'at. It is the approved \nstatement. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it \nis sound. Shaikh ibn Shas (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is the \nfamous transmission.  \n \nThe third is two prostration‟s and no rak'at, but the prayer is \nrepeated to be follow the one who says that it is obligatory in \nevery rak'at. The third transmission is derived from the first. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that completing the first is \nobligatory and repeating the second is recommended for care, and \nit is only recommended.]  \n \n12.2n The best judgment  \n \nThis last judgment is the best if Allah wills \n  \nThis is because it complies with the other two positions. His \nprostration before the salam and the prayer is not invalid, \ncompiling with the position that it is obligatory in the majority, for \ninstance, and repeating the prayer compiles with the second.  \n \nTwo points from Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi): The \nfirst is that the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) does not mention the \njudgment of when he omits recitation from most of the prayer, say \nthree out of four or two of out Maghrib. There are two positions in \nthat. The best known is that he prostrates before the salam and \nrepeats the prayer out of caution, i.e. it is recommended. In short, \nit is that if he omits most and half it is not invalid and he \nprostrates before the salam and repeats the prayer out of caution.  \n \nThe second is the place of the prior dispute. All of it is about \nomitting recitation of the Fatiha when he misses the place where \nit is done. If he does not miss it in that he remembers before he \nraises his head from the ruku' he returns to his recitation.  \n \nThere are two positions about repeating the sura. Shaikh al-\nLakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) recommends that it be repeated, \nand it is the well-known position, as in at-Tawdih, either since it \nis sunnah after the Fatiha or since it is sunnah that it is only done \nafter the Fatiha. It is apparent that the second statement, which \nis that it is not repeated, is not seen by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) in the collections. He thought that the sunnah was \nobtained by reciting it either before or after the Fatiha. Allah \nknow best. Based on what Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \npreferred of repeating it, Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that he prostrates after the salam, i.e. for that increase in \nwords. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he does \nnot have to prostrate for it, i.e. he does not think a prostration is \nentailed for that increase in words. This is the predominant \nposition. The author of at-Tawdih said that Shaikh ibn Habib's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) statement is sounder because there is no \nprostration for additional recitation by evidence, even if he recites \ntwo suras or recites a sura in the last two, as it says in at-Tahqiq.  \n \n12.2o No prostration for omission of a slight sunnah or \nmeritorious action  \n \nIf you forget to say one takbir or to say 'Sami’allahu liman \nhamidah' once or to do the Qunut you do not have to do the \nsajdas of forgetfulness \n  \nExcept for the takbir al-ihram. As for not prostrating for one \ntakbir, that is well-known. On that basis, if he prostrates for it \nbefore the salam, his prayer is invalid, unless he is following \nsomeone who believes that there is prostration for omitting that. \nThen his prayer is not invalid as it is not invalid if he omits the \nprostration after it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that he prostrates for it, and what he mentioned of not \nprostrating for omitting the one praise is the School. There is no \nprostration for omitting the Qunut. If he prostrates for it before \nthe salam, his prayer is invalid.  \n \n12.2p Remembering omissions after finishing the prayer  \n \nIf you finish the prayer and then remember that you left \nout part of it, you should go back to it straight-away by \nsaying a new takbir al-ihram - provided that very little \ntime has passed since you finished it -  \n \nThis is if you finish with the salam, believing you have done the \nprayer in full, forgetting that you have omitted something. This is \nnot incompatible with saying the salam intentionally. If he says \nthe salam forgetting that he is in the prayer or that he is speaking \nthe salam, then he is in the position of the one who did not say the \nsalam, and so he catches what he omitted. If he finishes and then \nremembers with certainty or doubt, and what is meant is by \nuncertainty is supposition, doubt, or suspicion, and he remembers \nthat he owes one of the obligatory pillars of the prayer like the \nruku', prostration or sitting according to the salam. If he says the \nsalam forgetting when rising from prostration, he sits for the \namount of the salam and says the salam, and then goes back, i.e. \nintends to complete it if it is close to the time where he left. \nShaikh at-Tata‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that literal position of \nthe school demands that he prays where he is immediately. If he \ndoes not do so and prays in another place, his prayer is invalid.  \n \nWhen he resumes and intends to complete the prayer, he says the \ntakbir al-ihram, with his intention to resume accompanying the \ntakbir. His outward words, \"very little time has passed\" is the \ntransmission of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). This is the accepted position. \nOpposite is that it is that if very little time has passed, he does not \nsay the tahrim. The difference is about the takbir. There is \nagreement about the intention. When we said that he resumes \nwith the tahrim, if he remembers while he is sitting, he says the \ntahrim as he is and does not have to stand. This is when he has \nleft the prayer from the place of sitting. If he has left it in another \nplace, like ending after praying one rak'at or three, except for \nMaghrib, he returns to rising from prostration and says that \ntahrim for it and does not sit. If he remembers while he is \nstanding, there are two statements about his tahrim. In short, the \nearly companions of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) believed \nthat he says the tahrim from standing because of because of \nimmediacy. On that basis, there are two positions on whether he \nsits afterwards and then rise or not. Shaikh ibn Shiblun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) believed that he sits because it was the state \nin which he left the prayer. That is the accepted position. He does \nnot say the takbir for that sitting. He sits without a takbir. When \nhe sits, he says the takbir for ihram, and then he stands with the \ntakbir which is done by the one who leaves the prayer after two. \nThe place is that he sits is for ihram when he says the salam after \ntwo. As for the one who says the salam for one or three, he returns \nto the state of his rising from prostration and says the tahrim and \ndoes not sit since that is the place of his sitting. It is desirable for \nhim to raise his hands when the takbir is said.  \n \n12.2q Doing what was missed out  \n \nand then do whatever it was that you missed out \n  \nAfter the takbir al-ihram, he prays the rest of the prayer when he \nsays the salam with certainly that his prayer was complete. If he \nsaid it either knowing that his prayer was not complete or being \nunsure whether it is clear that it was complete or incomplete, then \nthe prayer is invalid. You know what happens if you remember \nafter you said the salam. When you remember it before the salam, \nand it is in the last rak'at, he is either in ruku' or not. If he is in \nruku' he does it standing. If he has come up from ruku', he does it \nfixed. If it is in prostration, he does from a sitting position, or from \ntwo, then he does them from standing. If he does them from \nsitting out of forgetfulness then he prostrates before the salam \nbecause of the lack of going down for them which is not obligatory. \nOtherwise, it would not be mended by the prostration of \nforgetfulness. It is disliked to do that deliberately as Shaikh \nZarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \nIf what is omitted is not in the last, he does it as we stated when it \nis in the last in sitting or standing or bending and he has not \ncompleted the rak'at after the rak'at which has an omission, when \nhe finishes it, he has misses it and puts what he has done in its \nplace when he is alone or an Imam. What we mentioned is that he \ndoes the omitted obligation if he can catch it. If what was omitted \nwas the intention and the takbir al-ihram, they cannot be caught \nbecause if they are forgotten, there is no prayer. If he forgets one \nof them, he starts the prayer from its beginning. Know that the \nunsure omission is like the definite one, What is meant by doubt is \nhesitation. As for in the sunnah‟s, he only considers certain \nomission or where the doubt is equally balanced, not suspicion. \n \n12.2r After a long lapse of time  \n \nIf, however, a long time has elapsed or you have left the \nmasjid, you must begin the whole prayer again \n  \nIf you remember after a long time has passes after finishing the \nprayer, which is defined by custom according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) or you leave the masjid according to Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), you must begin again because one of the \npreconditions of the prayer is that all of it is at the same time.  \n \n12.2s Forgetting the salam  \n \nThat is also the case if someone forgets the salam \n  \nHe returns to sitting if it is soon and says the takbir al-ihram \nwhile seated and says the tashahhud. He brings the salam and \nprostrates after the salam, even if that is has been a long time or \nhe has left the masjid where he began his prayer and his place. He \nsays the takbir al-ihram while seated and the tashahhud and \nbrings the salam when he remembers the salam after leaving the \nplace. If he remembers it soon while he is sitting facing qibla, he \nsays the salam where he is and does not need a takbir by which he \nsays the ihram and he does not say a tashahhud. If he turns from \nit, they prayer is not invalidated if he faces it and says the salam \nHe does not owe the takbir al-ihram, or the tashahhud and he \nmust prostrate after the salam for forgetfulness.  \n \n12.2t Uncertainty about the number of rak'ats  \n \nIf you do not know whether you have prayed three or four \nrak'ats you build on what you are certain of, repeating \nanything you are unsure about, in this case praying \nanother rak'at to make sure of having prayed four. You \nthen do the sajdas of forgetfulness after the salam.  \n \nHe prays until he is uncertain. So if he is certain about three, and \nunsure about the fourth, complete discharge of responsibility is \nonly obtained by four. That is what the author means, \"He repeats \nanything he is unsure about\". He prostrates after the salam in the \nfamous position. Shaikh ibn Lubaba (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat he prostrates before the salam, and it is the literal \ninterpretation of what is in the Muwatta' and Muslim where the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When one you is \nunsure about his prayer and does not know whether he has \nprayed three or four, he should remove the doubt and build on \nwhat he is certain about and then do two prostration‟s before the \nsalam.\" \n \n12.2u Speaking inadvertently in the prayer  \n \nIf you speak during the prayer inadvertently, you also do \nthe sajdas of forgetfulness after the salam \n  \nThis is if the Imam or the individual speaks a little in the prayer, \nforgetting he is in the prayer or that he is speaking. If he speaks \ndeliberately, his prayer is invalid unless it has no purpose and so \nit is not invalid unless it is a lot in himself. A lot is known by \ncustom. Then he prostrates after the salam because it is increase \nand is mended by the prostration. Forgetfulness excludes the \nintentional, ignorant and the one forced, and the one who is \nobliged to speak to rescue a blind person, for instance. Their \nprayer is invalid.  \n \n12.2v Uncertainty about having said the salam  \n \nIf you are not sure whether you said the salam or not, you \nsay it and do not do any sajdas of forgetfulness \n  \nHe does not rise from his place. If it is near the tashahhud, and \ndoes not prostrate for forgetfulness because he said the salam, and \nhis prayer is complete. The second salam occurs outside the prayer \nand so there is no reason for prostration. If he did not say the \nsalam, he says it now, and no forgetfulness occurs from him for \nwhich he prostrates. When it is near, but he has moved from his \nplace, i.e. has not turned from qibla, he says the takbir again, the \ntashahhud and the salam and prostrates after the salam because \nof the increase. If he has not moved but turned from qibla, he \nfaces it and says the salam and does not do the tashahhud or \ntahrim and prostrates after the salam.  \n \n12.3 Constant Doubts  \n \n12.3a The case of someone subject to constant doubts  \n \nAnyone who finds themselves thinking all the time that \nthey have made a mistake in the prayer should pay no \nattention to their doubts \n  \nIf this happens, it is obligatory to ignore it and he should rely on \nwhat he feels in himself about that because it is a test from \nShaitan. When it has power over the heart, no action ever \nsucceeds with it and so the useful remedy for this disease which \nbrings about confusion is to turn away and the most beneficial \nremedy is to remember Allah azza wa jall: \"As for those who are \ngodfearing, when they are bothered by visitors from Shaitan, they \nremember. \" (7:201) When he says to him, for instance, \"You have \nonly prayed three,\" so he says, \"I have only prayed four and my \nprayer is sound.\"  \n \n12.3b What he does  \n \nThey do not have to do anything in reparation but they \nshould do the two sajdas after the salam \n  \nIf he repairs and builds on what he is certain about, his prayer is \nnot invalid as Shaikh al-Khattabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. \nPerhaps his reason is that the basis is building on certainty. He \nignores the person with constant doubts to make things easier for \nhim. According to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), it is \nrecommended that he prostrate after the salam because is more \nlike an addition if someone is like this since when he is unsure \nabout whether he prayed three or four, he might well pray five.  \n \n12.3c General position about people with doubts  \n \nThis refers to people who find this happening a lot and \nwho are continually in doubt about whether they have \nadded something to the prayer or left something out and \nnever feel certain that they have prayed correctly \n  \ni.e. doubt occurs very frequently, and he is always unsure about \nwhether he omitted or forgot. The end of the excuse in it is that he \ndoes not have to prostrate by way of the sunnah. This does not \ncontradict the fact that it is recommended for him to prostrate.  \n \nKnow that a lot is considered to be when this occurs to him in \nevery prayer or every wudu', or once to twice every day, or when it \ncomes one day and stops, or two days and then stops in the third. \nThat is the person with frequent doubt. If it comes two days and \nthen stops on the third, that is not someone with continual doubt, \nas when it comes to him one day about wudu' and one day about \nthe prayer: he is not someone with continual doubt because the \ndoubt about the means, like wudu' does not include doubt about \naims, like the prayer.  \n \n12.3d What such people do  \n \nThey should only do the two sajdas after the salam. On the \nother hand if they are certain that they have made a \nmistake they should make the appropriate reparation and \ndo the sajdas of forgetfulness \n  \nHe only has to prostrate after the salam only. However, if someone \nis certain that he is omitted something which would invalidate a \nrak'at, i.e. he is certain that he had forgotten a prostration or \nruku' and failed to catch it, as when he remembers while he is in \nthe final tashahhud, for instance, he does a rak'at in place of that \nwhich was corrupted and then he prostrates. If the rak'at in which \nhe forgot is one of the first two, he prostrates before the salam, \nbecause he has both increase and decrease. The increase is the \nrak'at which he nullified and sitting in other than its proper place. \nthe decrease is by omitting the sura because he brings a dubious \nrak'at by building, i.e., with the Fatiha only. If it is one of the last \ntwo, he only has increase and so he prostrates after the salam.  \n \n12.3e Always making the same mistake  \n \nIf someone is always making a particular mistake in the \nprayer and this happens a lot, he should make the \nappropriate \nreparation \nbut \nnot \ndo \nthe \nsajdas \nof \nforgetfulness \n  \nIf he often forgets something, as when it becomes his habit to \nalways forget the first sitting, or to forget the prostration, he puts \nit right. The reparation of that has two aspects: one is that he \nmissed the place of catching it and the second that he did not. The \nexample of the first is the one is someone who habitually forgets \nthe second prostration of the second rak'at, for instance, without it \nbeing a two rak'at prayer and he only remembers after the salam \nor after starting the third. He does a rak'at in the first and does \nnot prostrate and the third becomes the second and he does not \nprostrate. The example of the second is when he remembers in the \nfard before he starts the third. These two aspects are included \nunder \"appropriate reparation\". He does not prostrate for his \nforgetfulness.  \n \n12.3f Standing up directly after prostration  \n \nIf you begin to stand up directly from sujud at the end of \ntwo rak'ats you should sit back down again as long as your \nhands and knees have not left the ground \n  \nMeaning you move to rise. We do not take it literally so that it \ndoes not contradict with his words \"after he goes back\" because it \nliterally means that he does not stand up after two of the \nobligatory prayer, omitting the sitting and whoever obliges that he \nomits the tashahhud. When he sits and stands up forgetting the \ntashahhud, he does not go back nor prostrate for it. It is agreed \nabout when his hands and knees have not left the ground, so it \napplies even more if only his hands or knees have left the ground. \nThen he does the tashahhud and completes the prayer and does \nnot have to prostrate because of the insignificance of that. If he \ncontinues to stand up deliberately, his prayer is invalid in the \nwell-known \nposition \nbecause \nhe \nomitted \nthree \nsunnah‟s \ndeliberately. If he continues out of forgetfulness, he prostrates \nbefore the salam. \n \n12.3g What is done in this case  \n \nIf they have you should continue on up and not go back \ndown and then do the sajdas of forgetfulness before the \nsalam \n  \nIf his hands and knees have left the ground, he continues. If the \ntime of omission has been a long time and he has not prostrated, \nhis prayer is invalid. This is true in two cases: one is when he \nleaves the earth with his hands and knees without standing up \nstraight and then remembers after he has left the earth. The \nsecond is that he has left the earth and stood up straight. The \njudgment in it is the same: he continues and does not go back and \nthen he prostrates before the salam. However if he differs and \nreturns to sitting in the first instance deliberately, forgetfully or \nby ignorance, his prayer is not invalid and he prostrates after the \nsalam for the addition.  \n \nIn the second case, if he deliberately returns to sitting, the Tawdih \nstates that is well-known that it is sound, and he prostrates for it \nafter the salam for the addition. If he returns by ignorance, \nShaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) is reported in an-Nawadir as \nsaying that his prayer is invalid. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related that he continues his prayer and \nthen prostrates. If he goes back, he does not rise until he does the \ntashahhud .  \n \nIf he abandoned the tashahhud deliberately after returning, then \nhis prayer is invalid according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), but not of Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Perhaps the words of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) are based on its being invalid by deliberately abandoning a \nsunnah which differs from Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nIt is like that in some commentaries on Shaikh Khalil \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). If he goes back inadvertently, there is \nagreement that his prayer is not invalid. He prostrates after the \nsalam.  \n \n12.4 Missing a Prayer  \n \n12.4a Missing a prayer  \n \nIf you have missed a prayer you should do it as soon as you \nremember in the same way that you would have done it if \nyou have done it at its right time  \n \nIf you remember a prayer which you forgot, or slept through or \ndeliberately omitted in the well-known position of the School, you \nmust make it up without any disagreement in the case of the \nforgotten prayer, and the recognized position of the School in the \ncase of the deliberately omitted prayer. The basis for that is what \nSahih Muslim related that Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"If anyone forgets a prayer or sleeps through it, its expiation \nis that he pray it when he remembers it.\"  \n \nWhen you remember is whether it is in night or day at the sunrise \nand sunset, i.e. whenever you are certain or think that you have \nomitted it. As for when you are unsure, and things are equally \nbalanced, it must be made up, but you avoid those times of the \nprohibition, as is obligatory in the forbidden times and desirable \nto forbid the disliked times. As for a suspicion of omission or \nlogical possibility, it is neither obliged nor desirable to make it up \nin such cases. It is clear from the words of the author that it is \nobligatory to make up missed prayers immediately, and it is not \npermitted to delay except for an excuse.  \n \nHe does the number of ruku' and prostration and its forms - silent \nor aloud and does the Qunut if it is Subh and does the iqama for \nevery prayer. If he forgets it on a journey, he makes it up as on a \njourney. If he forgets it while resident, he makes it up as resident. \nHe the time of making it up and missing it differ in respect of \nhealth or illness, he takes account of the time when he is making \nthem up. If he misses it while healthy and is ill when he makes it \nup and can only make the intention or indicate with gesture, he \nmakes it up with intention or gesture and does not defer it \nbecause he might die. If this is adequate in performing the prayer, \nit is even more proper that it be adequate when making up a \nprayer.  \n \n12.4b Repeating prayers done after the missed prayer  \n \nIf you have already done the prayer of the time you are in \nyou should do it again after making up the prayer you \nmissed \n  \nThen after making up the missed prayers, you repeat the current \nprayer when it is within its time. This applies equally to the \nImam, the one praying alone, and one following. It is desirable for \neach of them to do it if he remembers a small number of missed \nprayers - four or five - after he has prayed the current prayer and \nthere still remains enough time to repeat the current prayer after \nmaking up what he forgot of a small number of missed prayers. \nThe example of that is if he forgets Maghrib of the day before, for \ninstance, and remembers it after he has prayed Subh the following \nday and before the sun rises. He prays Maghrib and repeats Subh, \nbut does not repeat 'Isha' since its time has gone. If he remembers \nMaghrib after sunrise, he does it and does not repeat anything at \nall.  \n \nIf he has prayed the current one and then remembers several \nmissed prayers, six or five, he does not repeat the present prayer \nafter he makes up what he missed. \n  \n12.4c If there are a lot of prayers to make up  \n \nIf you have a lot of prayers to make up you can do them at \nany time of the day or night, including sunrise and sunset, \naccording to what is convenient in your particular \nsituation \n  \nIf he has forgotten them, or slept through them, or intentionally \nleft them, he makes them up at any time of the day or night, even \nat sunset and sunset. He first spoke about a few prayers and here \nabout many, and repeats his words about sunset and sunrise to \nindicate Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) who says that \nonly Subh of the day can be prayed at sunrise and at sunset only \n'Asr of the day. His evidence is the previous hadith. However he \nindicates that hardship is removed when they are made up \nwithout laxness. Then he indicates the second part:  \n \n12.4d Less than five prayers to make up  \n \nIf the number of prayers you have to make up is less than \nfive you should do them before doing the prayer of the \ntime you are in even if that means going over the time of \nthat prayer \n  \nIf the number of prayers is less than the prayers of a 24 hour day, \nthen he is obliged to do them before the present prayer. Included \nin this is the one who owes Dhuhr and 'Asr, or Maghrib and 'Isha', \nand only has enough time for the last. Nevertheless he must do \nthe first. If he does the present prayer first, then it is valid \nalthough it is a wrong action to do it intentionally rather than out \nof forgetfulness, and he does not have to repeat when the time has \ngone. Thus he does the missed prayers even if that entails missing \nthe current prayer. This is the well-known position. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he begins with the current \nprayer.  \n \n12.4e Several missed prayers  \n \nIf the numbers of prayers you have to make up is greater \nthan this and you are afraid that if you do them you will \nnot be able to do the prayer of the time you are in its time, \nyou should pray that prayer first \n  \nThen he begins to clarify the judgment of the order of several \nmissed prayers with the current prayer. It is if he misses, \naccording to what the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, five or \nmore, or according what Shaikh al-Maziri (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nstates, six or more. It is understood from his words that when he \ndoes not fear missing the current prayer, he begins with the \nomitted ones. This is the position of Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). The accepted is what Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related that he begins absolutely with the \ncurrent prayer, whether the time is narrow or wide, but it is \nobligatory when the time is short and recommended when it is \nwide. Then he moves to speak on the third category.  \n \n12.4f Remembering a missed prayer while praying  \n \nIf, while you are doing a prayer, you remember having \nmissed a previous prayer, the prayer you are doing \nbecomes invalid \n  \nIf he remembers a few prayers, which are those which must be in \norder with the current prayer while doing an obligatory prayer, \nthen the prayer becomes invalid and so he must stop it. It is not \nactually that it is invalid. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays that it means that it is obligatory to stop the prayer. This \nstatement is the literal position of the school as he said in at-\nTawdih. It is said that it is recommended. The famous position is \nwhat is in al-Mudawanna that he continues with the Imam and \nrepeats it, and there is disagreement about the obligation to \nrepeat the prayer, i.e. based on the fact the order between a few \nprayers and several ones is an obligation of the precondition. It is \nwell-known in al-Mukhtasar that he repeats it in the time, i.e. it is \nnot obligatory to repeat it in the time, but it is recommended.  \n \nIn short, when the Imam or the one praying alone remembers a \nfew missed prayers before performing one rak'at with its \nprostration‟s, he must stop. It is also said that it is desirable. If he \nhas performed one rak'at with its prostration‟s, it is recommended \nthat he make it double. It is said that it is obligatory. The one \nfollowing follows his Imam in that. There is no difference between \nfour and two, like Subh, Jumu'a, and the shortened prayer. The \nliteral meaning of the Mudawwana is that Maghrib is like the \nothers and he makes it double if he has done one rak'at. This is \nnot relied on. Rather he completes Maghrib. That is what Shaikh \nibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers. If he remembers it after \ncompleting two full rak'ats of Maghrib with their prostration, he \ncompletes it with the intention of the obligation. If the one \nfollowing remembers a few missed prayers, he continues with his \nImam. Then it is desirable for him to repeat it within the time. \nThere is no difference whether the repeated prayer is a Jumu'a or \nother and he repeats it as Jumu'a is possible. Otherwise it is \nDhuhr.  \n \n12.5 Invalidation of the Prayer in Certain Cases  \n \n12.5a Laughing  \n \nIf you laugh while doing a prayer you have to repeat the \nprayer  \n \nThis is laughing with sound. It is obligatory to repeat the prayer \nbecause it is invalid by agreement if it is deliberate, whether it be \nthe Imam, person following or individual. According to the well-\nknown position, it is the same if it is inadvertent or from being \novercome. Opposite it is the position that it does not impair it, \nbased on analogy with speech. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the literal meaning of his words would be even if \nhe laughs silently at what Allah azza wa jall promises the \nbelievers as when he reads an ayat which describes the people of \nthe Garden and laughs out of happiness.  \n \nBased on the well-known position about the inadvertent and being \novercome, the Imam should delegate someone and then become a \nfollower and then it is obligatory to repeat it after that within the \ntime. What is meant inadvertence forgetfulness, as when he \nforgets that he is doing the prayer.   \n \n12.5b Laughing does not break wudu'  \n \nbut you do not have to do wudu' again \n  \nThis differs from Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) who \nsays that laughing breaks wudu' as it invalidates the prayer \nexcept in the funeral prayer where it only invalidates the prayer. \nThe one following is different from the one alone and the Imam in \nsuch a case. \n  \n12.5c If you laugh behind an Imam  \n \nIf this happens when you are praying behind an Imam you \ncomplete the prayer with him but then do it again \nafterwards \n  \nIf someone laughs in a prayer behind an Imam, it is recommended \nthat he continue to observe the prayer. It is said that it is \nobligatory, and the one who follows continues limited by the first \nso he cannot leave while laughing, but is overcome. It is the same \nif he does it by forgetfulness. If he is able to leave, he does not \ncontinue. The second is that he did not laugh intentionally. \nOtherwise he does not continue in being overcome and \nforgetfulness afterwards. The third is that he does not fear by \ncontinuing that the will miss the time. Otherwise he stops. The \nfourth is that the laughter of those following, all or some, does not \noblige that it continue. Otherwise, he stops, even if he suspects \nthat. The fifth is that it is not Jumu'a. Otherwise he stops, even if \nthe time is ample.  \n \n12.5d Smiling  \n \nIf you merely smile no reparation is necessary \n  \nIf anyone praying only smiles while praying, he does not have to \nprostrate for forgetfulness nor does the prayer become invalid \nwhen it is intentional or done through ignorance, although it is \ndisliked to do it intentionally. If it is a lot, then the prayer is \ninvalidated, even if it is due to forgetfulness because the smile is \nthe movement of the lips and so it is like the movements of eyelids \nor feet. \n  \n12.5e Blowing  \n \nBlowing in the prayer incurs the same judgment as talking \n- if it is intentional it invalidates your prayer \n  \nIt invalidates it if it is deliberate and done by ignorance, but does \nnot when it is by a slight forgetfulness, and he prostrates after the \nsalam. It is not a precondition for the invalidation on account of \nblowing that two letters appear from him nor one letter. It is clear \nfrom that what is meant is blowing with the mouth. When it is \ndone with the nose, it does not invalidate the prayer, even if \nintentionally, and there is no prostration for its forgetfulness. The \nevidence for invalidation is what is related from Ibn 'Abbas \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) who said that blowing in the prayer is speech, \nand so it invalidates it.  \n \nIt is agreed that clearing the throat out of necessity does not \ninvalidate the prayer nor is there prostration for it. There are two \npositions about when it is not necessary by Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), which distinguish between the intentional \nand forgetful. The other statement is that it absolutely does not \ninvalidate it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes that \nposition and Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh \nal-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefer it since it is insignificant.  \n \nThe school is that the sigh on account of illness does not invalidate \nthe prayer, even though it is one of the sounds which are \nconnected to speech because it is the place of necessity. Shaikh \nBahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that. It is like that with weeping. When it is not \naccompanied with sound, it does not invalidate when it is used to \nhumility, i.e. it is a precondition that he be overcome. In short, \nwhat is connected to weeping is when it is without sound that it \ndoes not invalidate, whether it is by choice or being overcome by \nhumility or not unless there is a lot of volition in it. That which is \nhas sound invalidates, whether it is by humility or affliction if it is \nby choice. \n  \n12.5f Mistake about qibla  \n \nIf you make a mistake regarding the direction of qibla you \nshould do the prayer again if there is still time \n  \nThis refers to any of the people of ijtihad with evidence of the \ndirection of the Ka'ba. It includes the one who imitates someone \nelse of good reputation and knowledge, or a mihrab when he is \noutside of Makka or Madina and strives in the direction which he \nthinks is it since he has tokens of it. So he prays in that direction \nand then it becomes clear to him after he has finishes the prayer \nthat he was wrong about the direction of qibla, so that he had his \nback to qibla or deviated a lot from it. It is always recommended \nthat he repeat the prayer within the ikhtiyari time. If he prays \nwithout striving, then must repeat the prayer even if he gets it \nright.  \n \n12.5g If there is impurity on clothes or the place  \n \nThe same applies if you do the prayer in clothes with some \nimpurity on them or pray in an impure place \n  \nOr if there is impurity on the body and you then remember that \nimpurity after finishing the prayer, then the prayer is repeated in \nthe time. The time for Dhuhr is until yellowing and for Maghrib \nand 'Isha' it is the entire night.  \n \n12.5h Wudu' with unacceptable water  \n \nThe same also applies if you have done wudu' with water \nwhose color, taste, or smell has definitely changed, you \nmust do the prayer again however much time has elapsed \nand of course repeat your wudu' \n  \nIf he does this out of forgetfulness with impure water, which is \nthat which has changed, as a small amount of water into which \nsomething impure has fallen and not changed and he does not \nremember until he has finished his prayer. If he remembers it \nduring the prayer, then it is invalid simply by remembering it. \nThe recommendation is dependent on remembering it. His words \nare based on his school, which is that a little matter in which \nimpurity has fallen and has not changed is impure. The accepted \nposition is that it is not impure. On that basis, he does not have to \nrepeat it at all.  \n \n12.6 Joining prayers  \n \n12.6a Joining Maghrib and 'Isha'  \n \nYou are allowed to join Maghrib and 'Isha when there is \nheavy rain and also if the night is muddy and very dark \n  \nWhat he mentioned about joining on a rainy night is an \nindulgence upon which the author of the Mukhtasar proceeds, and \ndoes not make its judgment clear. Is it allowable, which is the \nliteral meaning of their words, but not the most appropriate which \nis the occurrence of the prayer in its time?  \n \nLinguistically allowance is to make easy. In the Shari‟ah it is to \npermit something forbidden when a preventative reason exists, i.e. \nif it were not for the existence of that difficulty, and the \npreventative reason here is that it can be done in its time. Part of \nwhat the author mentioned as a reason for joining is well-known, \nand it is rain. Rain is a reason for joining Maghrib and 'Isha' \naccording to the famous position provided that it is a lot of rain. It \nis that which causes average people to cover their heads, whether \nit falls or is about to fall which is known by the conditions. Snow \nand cold are similar to rain.  \n \nIt is agreed that another reason for joining is mud and darkness. \nWhat is meant is thick mud and darkness means a night without \nmoon. If the clouds cover the moon, then it is not darkness, and \nthe prayers are not joined for that. It is evident from the words of \nthe author that the prayers are not joined for darkness alone nor \nfor mud alone. That is the case. The people of the school agree that \nthe prayers are not joined for darkness alone. As for mud, Shaikh \nal-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that the well-known position \nthat they are not joined. To summarize, his position is that the \nallowance between Maghrib and 'Isha' is that only these two \nprayers can be joined. That is indeed the case. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that .  \n \n12.6b How joining is done: when it is done  \n \nWhen this is the case the adhan for Maghrib is called at the \nbeginning of the time outside the masjid. Then, according \nto Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), you should wait a \nlittle,  \n \nThe well-known position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is \nthat you wait a little. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) disagrees, but \nthis is the well-known position. Maghrib should be delayed a little \nso that those whose houses is far from the masjid can come to the \nmasjid.  \n \n12.6c The iqama for Maghrib of the joined prayers  \n \nthen call the iqama inside the masjid and do the prayer \n  \nAfter this short delay, it is sunnah to give the iqama for the \nprayer inside the masjid. It should not be long in the well-known \nposition because it should be shortened in other instances and so \nit is more appropriate here. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that joining should be intended in the first. There are \ntwo statements about when he delays it to the second, i.e. about \nwhether or not it is allowed. Both agree that the intention should \nbe with the first and the dispute is whether it is allowed when it is \nin the second, being obligatory that he intend it then. In short, its \nplace is the first and it is demanded of the Imam and the follower. \nIf the follower omits it, it is not invalid, and so it is obligatory, but \nnot a precondition. As for the intention of the Imam, it is \nnecessary. If the Imam omits the intention to be Imam, they are \ninvalid since it is omitted in them. If he leaves it in the second and \ndoes it in the first, the evident position is that it is sound and the \nsecond is invalid. He only prays it when the twilight vanishes. If \nhe omits it in the first and intends to join, it is invalid because its \nvalidity is dependent on the intention of being an Imam.   \n \n12.6d The adhan and iqama for 'Isha'  \n \nThen you call the adhan for 'Isha inside the masjid and do \nthe iqama and then do the prayer \n  \nThis is done after Maghrib is finished, without delay or \nglorification or praise or nafila. So there is no nafila between \nMaghrib and 'Isha' in the well-known position. The adhan for \n'Isha' is given after Maghrib. It is clear that this adhan is \nrecommended because it is not a group which needs another one. \nIt is inside the masjid so that people do not think that it is the \ntime of 'Isha' has come. After the adhan, the iqama is given and \nthe Imam leads the people in the prayer immediately. This is a \nprecondition for every joining, and it is not particular to joining on \na rainy night.  \n \n12.6e Leaving after the joining  \n \nThen everyone should leave while there is still some light \nleft in the sky \n  \nThey should leave after the prayer without delay. If they join and \ndo not leave until the twilight has gone, then they repeat 'Isha'. It \nis also said that they do not repeat it.  \n \n12.6f The second case of joining: 'Arafat  \n \nIt is an obligatory sunnah to join together Dhuhr and 'Asr \nat Arafat at midday with an adhan and an iqama for each \nprayer \n  \nThis is on the hajj. It is a confirmed sunnah. This question is dealt \nwith in the chapter on Hajj.  \n \n12.6g The third case of joining: at Muzdalifa  \n \nThe same applies to joining Maghrib and 'Isha on your \narrival at Muzdalifa \n  \ni.e. the same judgment as regards the sunnah and the adhan for \nMaghrib and 'Isha' applies at Muzdalifa. The author of the \nMukhtasar considered it to be recommended. The accepted \nposition is that it is sunnah. This is when it is possible to reach it. \nIf that is not possible due to illness or his mount, then he joins \nwhen the twilight departs when he stops with the Imam. The fiqh \nof the question is that the one going to Muzdalifa either stands \nwith the Imam or not. The obligation is that he stands with the \nImam. If he does not stand with the Imam as when he stands \nalone or does not stand at all, he prays every prayer in its proper \ntime.  \n \n12.6h The fourth case: joining when traveling  \n \nIf you are traveling hard you are permitted to join two \nprayers together; that is to pray Dhuhr at the end of its \ntime together with 'Asr at the beginning of its time and \nlikewise with Maghrib and 'Isha \n  \nThis is on an obligatory journey like the hajj and the commercial \njourney, whether the prayer is shortened in it or not. He is \npermitted to join two prayers whose time is shared, like Dhuhr \nand 'Asr, and Maghrib and 'Isha'. When midday catches him while \ntraveling and he intends to camp before sunset, he can join Dhuhr \nand 'Asr at the end the first time and the beginning of 'Asr.  \n \nThe description of joining Maghrib and 'Isha' the same as that of \njoining Dhuhr and 'Asr in that when sunset catches him and he \nintends to camp after dawn, he can join Maghrib and 'Isha' \nformally since he prays Maghrib near the vanishing of the twilight \nand prays 'Isha' at the beginning of its time because he will dawn \nhere is like sunset in respect of Dhuhr and 'Asr.  \n \n12.6i When starting out  \n \nIf you are starting your journey at the beginning of the \ntime of the first prayer you may also join the two prayers \ntogether then \n  \nAccording to the famous position, he can join before he sets out by \nputting the first of them at the beginning of the ikhtiyari time and \nthe other in its daruri time. This is the real joining. From this it is \nknown that the daruri time of 'Asr extends before and after it. The \nreal joining is not like this and is only done by someone with an \nexcuse in the form of a journey or something else. As for the \nformal joining, it is permitted for the one who has an excuse and \nothers. When he intends to camp before the sun yellows, he cannot \njoin. Rather he should pray Dhuhr before he travels and delay 'Asr \nuntil he stops, i.e. it is obligatory because he is able to put each \nprayer in its allotted time in the Shari‟ah. He can choose about the \n'Asr prayer. If he wishes he delays it until he stops. If he wishes, \nhe brings it forward if he intends to camp when the sun yellows.  \n \n12.6j Fifth case: sick people joining prayers  \n \nSick people are permitted to join the prayers if they are \nafraid, at the time or Dhuhr or Maghrib, that their sickness \nwill cause them to lose consciousness before the time of the \nnext prayer  \n \nThey can join prayers which share in the time in the well-known \nposition. Shaikh ibn Nafi' (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that each \nprayer should be prayed in its proper time. If they fear that they \nmight become unconscious at the second prayer, they can join. \nThis is at the beginning of the time of the first prayer according to \nthe well-known position. It is said that the first is at the end of its \ntime and the second at the beginning of its time. In the well-\nknown position, he joins Dhuhr and 'Asr at midday and Maghrib \nand 'Isha' at sunset. He joins at the beginning of the time because \nhe is afraid that he will become unconscious and that permits \njoining. It is like the fever which comes in fits, i.e. shakes, or \nvertigo which will come at the second time when he is sure of that.  \n \nNOTE: When he joins out of fear of being unconscious at the \nsecond time and then that is removed by being free of that, 'Isa \nsaid that he repeats the second prayer. Shaikh Sanad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he means within the time. The \nmost probable is that it is the daruri time. Shaikh ibn Sha'ban \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he does not repeat it, but that \nweak.  \n \n12.6j Second category Joining making it easier for the sick \nperson  \n \nIf joining the prayers makes things easier for someone \nsuffering from dysentery or a similar illness, he can do the \ntwo prayers together either in the middle of the time of \nDhuhr or when the redness in the sky fades after Maghrib  \n \nThis applies to all illnesses which make it difficult for him to rise \nfor every prayer. Then he can join two prayers whose time is \nshared, and so he joins Dhuhr and 'Asr in the middle of Dhuhr, \nand Maghrib and 'Isha' when the twilight fades. So Maghrib \noccurs at the end of its ikhtiyari time, based on its extending to \ntwilight and 'Isha' at the beginning of its ikhtiyari time.  \n \n \n12.7 Prayer missed because of an impediment  \n \n12.7a Prayers missed while unconscious  \n \nIf you faint you do not have to make up any prayers whose \ntime finishes while you are still unconscious. If you regain \nconsciousness, however, while there is still time to do at \nleast one rak’at you must make up that prayer \n  \nYou do not have to make up any prayers while you were \nunconscious. The same applies to the one who is intoxicated by \nsomething lawful, as when someone drinks wine thinking that it \nis milk or honey. The same applies to someone who is insane. This \nis while they are in that state, whether what he misses it is a lot \nor little, as opposed to Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nwho says that he makes up what is little, like five prayers or less. \nWhen you regain consciousness, you make up the prayer of the \ntime, meaning within the daruri time. It is sunset for Dhuhr and \n'Asr, and dawn for Maghrib and 'Isha' and sunrise for Subh.  \n \nHe clarifies the amount and says that the time in which he \nrecovers consciousness must be enough to perform one rak'at with \nits prostration‟s after obtaining what is necessary to perform the \nprayer, which is only purity from minor impurity in the accepted \nposition. When he faints and does not pray Dhuhr and 'Asr and \nthere remains enough of the day to pray five rak'ats after \npurification from impurity, he does not make it up because he was \nunconscious in their time. If he recovers consciousness and there \nremains enough of the day to pray five rak'ats after purification, \nhe makes them up because he was conscious in their time. If he \nfaints when he has not prayed Maghrib and 'Isha', and there \nremains of their time the amount of five rak'ats, he does not make \nthem up. If he becomes conscious for this amount, he makes them \nup. It is like that with the judgment in dropping and the making \nup when there remains four rakat‟s of Fajr because one considers \nthe excellence of one rak'at from the first. If there remains the \namount of three rak'ats of Fajr, 'Isha' falls and Maghrib remains \nhis responsibility.  \n \n12.7b When a menstruating woman becomes pure  \n \nThe same applies to a menstruating woman when she \nbecomes pure. If, after doing ghusl straight away, there is \nstill enough of the daytime left to do five rak'ats, she \nshould pray both Dhuhr and 'Asr \n  \nThen means when her period stops. The same applies to bleeding \nafter childbirth. She does not make up any prayer whose time has \npassed and performs a time sufficient for one rak'at or more \nremains after she has purified herself. The time in which she \npurifies herself is either day or night. In the day, it applies when \nshe becomes pure and after she has purified herself with water \nwhen tayammum is not obliged for her. Otherwise it is the \namount required for tayammum. In short purity is determined for \nher for more than what sufficient for a full rak'at with both \nprostration‟s. It is like all the excuses except for disbelief.  \n \n12.7c More about the menstruating woman  \n \nIf there is enough of the night left to do four rak'ats she \nshould pray both Maghrib and 'Isha. If there is less left of \nthe day or night than that she should only pray the second \nof the two prayers \n  \nThis is when she becomes pure at night. If, after she purifies \nherself, there is enough time for four rak'ats according to the \nposition of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) based on \nestimating Maghrib with three rak'ats and one rak'at for 'Isha'. \nThis is the determination for the woman at home and traveling \nwithout difference since there is no difference in the two night \nprayers between the resident and traveler.  \n \n12.7d When menstruation starts  \n \nIf a woman's period starts with these same amounts of time \nleft in the day or the night without her having done the \nprayers in question she does not have to make them up  \n \nThis is five rak'ats in the day and four in the night, whether she \ndelayed them out of forgetfulness or intentionally, and if she was \nrebellious in the deliberateness. If she menstruates and there \nremains of the day the amount of five rak'ats and she has not \nprayed Dhuhr and 'Asr, she does not make them up because she \nmenstruated in the time.  \n \n12.7e More about when menstruation starts  \n \nHowever, if it starts in the daytime when there is only time \nfor three rak'ats or less she should make up the first of the \ntwo prayers \n  \nIf it starts in the day when she has not prayed Dhuhr and 'Asr, or \nshe menstruates, and there still enough time for three rak'ats or \nless up to one, or she has not prayed Maghrib and 'Isha', she \nmakes up the first prayer which is Dhuhr in the first instance and \nMaghrib in the second because it came while she was pure and the \nsecond is omitted because she menstruated in its time. When the \ntime is short, then the last is singled out for being caught or \ndropped.  \n \n12.7f Another point on this  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion about the judgment if a \nwoman's period starts when there is enough of the night \nleft to pray four rak'ats. Some people say that the same \napplies and others say that since her period began in the \ntime of both prayers she does not have to make either of \nthem up \n  \nIt is said that the judgment is like when she menstruates when \nthere are three rak'ats of the night left: she makes up only the \nfirst prayer. That is stated by Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others, based on the calculating the \nsecond. Its reason is that when the time is short so that there is \nonly enough for one of the two prayers, then the obligation is the \nlast one. The other is that she does not make them up, and it is \nthe position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. It is the school since they \nbelieve that calculation in two prayers with a shared time is by \nthe first. Its reason is that the first of the two prayers must be \nadvanced before the other and that actually obliges calculation of \nit. Then he discusses things which oblige wudu'. \n \n12.8 Defects in wudu'  \n \n12.8a Certainty about wudu' but not about breaking it  \n \nIf you are sure that you have done wudu' but not sure \nwhether you have broken it or not since, you should make \nwudu' again \n  \nIt is obliged according the well-known position. The literal words \nof the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) are when doubt accompanies \ncertainty at the same time, which is impossible. So it is better to \nassume the \"then\" means \"and\" so he knows that the doubt is later \nthan certainty. What is meant is something which breaks wudu' in \ngeneral, whether that doubt is during the prayer or outside it, \nunless it arises in it after he has begun it feeling certain about \npurity. In such a case, he must continue in it and after he \ncompletes it is clear to him that he is still in purity he does not \nrepeat it. If it clear that he broke purity or he still has doubts, he \nis obliged to repeat it.   \n \n12.8b Miss out a fard aspect of wudu'  \n \nIf you remember missing out any fard aspect of wudu' soon \nafter finishing it, you do the thing you missed out and \nwhatever comes after it \n  \nThen he speaks about the judgment of someone who omits any \nfard aspect of the wudu' or one of its sunnah‟s. The first has four \ncategories because he either omits it intentionally or forgetfully, \nand each of them either remembers soon after or a long time after. \nThe second is also like that and so there are eight categories .  \n \nThe first is when he remembers that he did not wash a fard part, \nlike the face, hands to elbows, feet to the ankles, or wipe the head, \nand it is soon after, it is an obligation that he repeat that with the \nintention of completing wudu' because the fard is not removed by \nforgetfulness He must intend to complete wudu' in the well-known \nposition. Otherwise it is not adequate as Shaikh at-Tata'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) clearly states. When he does what he left \nout, it is recommended that he repeat what followed it to the end \nof wudu' for the sake of the proper order. Some commentaries say \nit is sunnah.  \n \nThere is disagreement about the definition of nearness. Shaikh \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) refers to custom in all that is \nnot defined by the Lawgiver. He says that its limit is as long as \nthe limbs have not dried within the normal time and the normal \nlimb and normal place. It is well-known.  \n \n12.8c Second category: if it is after a long time  \n \nIf some time has elapsed you just do the thing you missed \nout  \n \nWhen he remembers the forgotten things after the washed place is \ndry, he only does it three times with the intention immediately at \nthe time when he remembers. If he delays it a long time after he \nremembers it, his wudu' is invalid, even if he forgets, because he \ndoes not have the excuse of forgetting the second time in the \naccepted position. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat he repeats it.  \n \n12.8d Third category: Deliberate  \n \nexcept if you missed it out deliberately in which case you \nmust do the whole wudu' again \n  \ni.e. you deliberately missed out one of the fards of wudu', then it is \nobligatory to begin again if it is a long time since omitting \nwashing the washed limb or wiping the wiped limb. This is based \non the fact that doing it immediately is obligatory. It is to do \nwudu' in the same time without significant separation with \nremembrance and ability. It is the well-known position.   \n \n12.8e Fourth category: deliberate but not long  \n \nThe fourth category is when he intentionally omits that and not \nlong has passed: he repeats it and what is after it for the sake of \norder. There is no difference between the deliberate and forgetful \nwhen it is soon, but they differ after a long time. The forgetter \nbuilds, even if it is a long time, as opposed to when it is deliberate. \nIf a long time has passed, he starts wudu' .  \n \n12.8f If you have done the prayer  \n \nIf, in any of the above situations, you have already done \nthe prayer you must do it over again no matter how much \ntime has gone by having put right wudu' as necessary \n  \nIf he omits any fard element of his wudu' and then prays with that \nwudu', whether deliberate or by forgetfulness, soon or after a long \ntime, then he must always repeat the prayer because he prayed it \nwithout wudu'. But repeating wudu' is in the one category and it is \nwhen it is intentional and a long time has passed. \n \n12.8g Fifth category: omitting a sunnah element  \n \nIf you remember missing out something like rinsing out \nthe mouth or snuffing up water or wiping the ears and \nonly a short time has elapsed you should do the thing you \nmissed on its own \n  \nHe does not repeat what is after it in the school because the order \nbetween sunnah and fard is not obligatory.  \n \n12.8h The sixth: after a long time  \n \nIf a long time has passed you must do the thing you missed \nbefore doing any other prayers \n  \nIf he remembers what he forgot of the sunnah‟s of his wudu' after \na long time, he only does that which he forgot before any other \nprayers. As when he remembers after he has prayed Dhuhr, he \ndoes it for 'Asr if he is still in wudu'. So if he wants to pray 'Asr \nwith it, it is sunnah for him to do that omitted sunnah. Tawaf is \nlike the prayer. In short, if it is near, he does the omitted sunnah \nwhen he wants to remain in purity. If he does not want to pray or \ndo anything else and it is a long time, it is sunnah to do when he \nwants to pray or do tawaf. Length means that he has prayed with \nthat wudu' and its absence is that he has not prayed with it. That \nis explicitly stated by Shaikh ibn al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n12.8i Prayers already done  \n \nYou do not have to repeat any prayer you have already \ndone \n  \nWhen you pray with a wudu' in which a sunnah is forgotten, \nbecause it was done with certainty of purity and because the \nprayer is not invalidated by omitting one of the sunan of wudu', \neven if all of them are omitted. It is like that with the sunnah‟s of \nghusl. There is strong disagreement about the sunnah‟s of the \nprayer so that if he intentionally omits a sunnah intentionally, it \nis said that the prayer is invalid. It is said that it is because of the \nabsence of the sunnah element because the obligation is applied to \nits sunnah‟s, i.e. the prayer by the words of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam), \"Pray as you saw me pray.\" That is weak \nin respect of wudu' by the Holy Prophet‟s (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwords, \"Do wudu' as Allah has commanded you,\" i.e. He only \ncommanded four.  \n \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not speak about reversals, as \nwhen he puts the hands before the face, for instance. In short, the \none who reverses repeats only that part if he reverses by \nforgetfulness. Otherwise it is always desirable to repeat wudu' and \nthe prayer within the time and elsewhere. When time is short, \nthere is no difference between it being deliberate or forgetful. He \nrepeats what was reversed three times by the sunnah in following \nit in the Shari‟ah, one each times is not desirable. \n  \n12.8j Impurity on the mat  \n \nIf a mat has some impurity on it but you do the prayer on a \npart which is pure your prayer is valid \n  \nIf whatever you pray on has an impurity, wet or dry, whether or \nnot it moves when he moves, he does not have to repeat the prayer \nbecause it is not invalid so that it would need to be repeated. He is \nasked to purify the place which his limbs touch. This is opposed to \nthe turban whose end hangs on the ground where there is \nimpurity: his prayer is invalid by agreement if the impurity moves \nwith it.  \n \n12.8k A dispensation  \n \nThere is no harm in a sick man putting down a thick cloth \nwhich is pure over his bedding which has impurity on it \nand then doing the prayer on that \n  \nIt is a precondition that the garment on which he reclines is \nseparate from the place of prayer. Otherwise the prayer is invalid. \nIt is also a precondition that it be thick and not thin. It clear from \nthis that the healthy person has no excuse to do that, and that is \nexplicit in the  text of the Mudawwana. It is said that that is \ngeneral to the sick and healthy person and Shaikh ibn Yunus \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is correct.  \n \n12.9 The Prayer of a sick person  \n \n12.9a If he is unable to stand  \n \nIf a sick man cannot pray standing up  \n \nIf a person cannot stand upright to recite all of the Fatiha on his \nown or leaning on someone else other than someone in janaba or \nmenstruating or it will entail great hardship. If he is ill, then he is \neither unable to stand at all, or fears he will become ill, or it will \nincrease, or there will be great hardship with the precondition \nthat he is ill, not that he is healthy. If he is healthy, the hardship \nmentioned does not permit him not to stand and make it \npermissible for him to pray sitting. The obligation to stand \nindependently is in the state of doing obligatory elements, like \nruku', tahrim and reciting the Fatiha for other than the one \nfollowing, and not for the one following. If the one following leans \non a pillar while it is recited such that if it were to be removed, he \nwould fall, is prayer is still valid as is the case absolutely in the \nreciting the sura, i.e. for one praying alone, an Imam or one \nfollowing, as is confirmed by the one who knows and does not pay \nattention to what was said other than that. Some commentators \nare mislead by the literal expression.  \n \n12.9b The sick person prays as best he can  \n \nhe should pray sitting down, cross-legged if possible; if not \nthen to the best of his ability \n  \nOn his own in the well-known position, i.e. it is not valid for him \nto be Imam either for those ill or healthy, even those like him. \nThat is what some of them state, but that is weak. The accepted \nposition is that the Imam should be healthy for those who are \nhealthy. It is best that he sit cross-legged in the place of standing, \nif he is able to do so. This is on the basis that sitting is a \nsubstitute for standing. It is said that he sits as he sits for the \ntashahhud, and the later people prefer that. According to the first, \nhe alters his sitting between the two prostration‟s, as in the \ntashahhud. Similarly, it is the best in respect of nafila prayers to \nsit cross-legged since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nthat. Otherwise he sits as best he can, and it is desirable but not \nobligatory that there be an order between it and being cross-\nlegged.  \n \n12.9c Gestures for prostration and bowing  \n \nIf he is not able to go into sujud he should make a gesture \nof going into ruku' and sujud, making what he does for \nsujud lower than what he does for ruku' \n  \nIf the sick person cannot sit, he indicates prostration by bowing. If \nhe is unable to it altogether or there will be great hardship in \ngoing so, he indicates by his head and back, i.e. must indicate with \nthem. If he cannot do it with his back, he indicates with his head, \nIf he cannot do that, then he indicates as he can, and places his \nhand on his knees when he indicates bowing. When he rises, he \nraises them. When he indicates prostration, he places his hands \non the earth and when he rises from it, he places them on his \nknees. It is recommended that his prostration be lower than his \nbowing. Some say that it is obligatory. It is understood from the \nwords of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the Mudawwana. It \nis also understood from some of the commentators on Shaikh \nKhalil (rahmatullahi alaihi). When you know that, then the \njudgment that it is recommended is weak. It is disliked for the one \nwho gestures to lift anything on which he prostrates. If he does \nthat he does not repeat his prayer, whether he does that \nintentionally or out of ignorance. This is when he intends the \nearth by his indication. If he intends that what he lifts is not the \nearth, it is not permitted, as Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said.  \n \n12.9d If he is unable to sit  \n \nIf he cannot sit he should pray lying on his right side \nmaking gestures to indicate the various positions \n  \nIf he cannot sit on his own or supported or cross-legged or \notherwise, he prays on side with his face towards qibla as he \nwould be in the grave. If he cannot go on his right side, then on his \nleft side.  \n \n12.9e If he can only lie on his back  \n \nIf he is unable to do anything but lie on his back he should \npray in that position \n  \nIf he can only pray on his back, he gestures with his feet to qibla. \nIf he is unable to pray on his back, he prays lying on his stomach \nwith his face to qibla and his feet behind him. The judgment about \nfacing qibla in those states is that it is obligatory when he has the \nability to do so. If he prays to other than the qibla when he is able \nto face it, the prayer is invalid. The ability is when there is \nsomeone who is able to move him. If he finds someone to move him \nafter the prayer, it is recommended that he repeat it within the \ntime.  \n \nThe one who prays lying down indicates with his head. If he is \nunable to indicate with his head, he indicates with his eyes and \neyebrows. If he cannot do this, then it is with his finger. The \nliteral text as Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said is that \nthe order in the gesture using these three is obligatory.  \n \n12.9f The prayer should not be delayed  \n \nAs long as he is in his right mind he should not delay the \nprayer and do it as best as he is able  \n \nThis means he does not omit it, and he should pray as best he can, \nstanding, sitting, indicating and lying down. The sick person prays \naccording to his ability, even only with the intention of its actions, \nif he is unable to indicate with a limb or something else. He \nintends its pillars with his heart so that he intends tahrim, \nrecitation, bowing, rising and prostration, etc. of the actions of the \nprayer.  \n \n12.9g Tayammum  \n \nIf a sick man cannot use water because doing so would be \nharmful to him or because he cannot get anyone to bring \nhim any, he should do tayammum. If he cannot find anyone \nto bring him earth, he should do tayammum using the wall \nat his side provided that it is made of clay or covered with \nclay. However if the wall is covered with plaster or \nwhitewash it cannot be used for tayammum \n  \nWhen the one who must perform the prayer is unable to use \nwater, then he does tayammum. If no one brings him earth, he can \nuse the wall if it clay, or covered with clay. So he can do \ntayammum with earth brought to him. It is also understood that \nhe only uses the wall for tayammum when there is no earth. That \nis different from the School. The School is that it is permitted to do \ntayammum with the wall when there is earth, but it is desirable \nthat he not do tayammum with it except when there are is no \nearth. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar said \nthat it is like earth, and it is best. In short, the sick person or \nhealthy person is permitted to do tayammum on the unbaked \nbrick wall and the stone wall, even if he finds earth when there is \nno barrier to prevent him touching it. If the wall is covered with \nsomething manufactured, it is not used. Shaikh az-Zabidi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it.  \n \n12.10 The prayer while mounted  \n \n12.10a In case of mud which prevents prostration  \n \nIf the prayer becomes due while you are traveling and you \ncannot find anywhere to pray because of mud, you should \nget off your riding animal and do the prayer standing up, \nmaking the motion you do for sajda lower than the one for \nruku' \n  \n When you are traveling and the ikhtiyari time is short, as it says \nsome of the commentaries on Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand the commentary of Shaikh at-Tata‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe best time is that in which it is ikhtiyari or daruri. If it is light \nmud, and he despairs of getting out of it in the ikhtiyari or daruri \ntime and he is able to dismount, but cannot find any place to pray \nbecause of soiling his clothes or flood on the road, then he \ndismounts and prays standing, bowing for ruku' and prostration. \nHe indicates ruku' by partially bowing his chest. If he touches his \nknees, for instance, which is a full ruku', then he bows in fact and \nhis indication of prostration is lower than ruku'. When he \nindicates ruku', he places his hands on his knees and when he \nrises he lifts them from them. When he indicates prostration, he \nindicates the earth with his hands and intends to sit between the \ntwo prostration‟s standing, and the same with the sitting of the \ntashahhud. While standing, he separates the standing and sitting \nwith an intention. As for the one who thinks it probable that he \nwill get out of it before the end of the time, he delays it to the end \nof the time.  \n \n12.10b The necessity of praying mounted  \n \nIf there is so much mud that you cannot even dismount you \nshould do the prayer on your riding animal facing qibla \n  \ni.e. the place where he would alight from his mount. He prays by \nindication, but if he cannot dismount out of fear of sinking, he \nprays on his mount towards qibla. The prayer on the animal is \nonly permitted by fear of sinking. Fear of getting his clothes dirty \ndoes not oblige the validity of the prayer on the animal. It is \npermitted to pray by indication on land. It is the same, for \ninstance, if he prays on the animal facing qibla when there is no \nmud and he fears to dismount because of thieves or wild animals. \nThen he can pray on his animal and indicate ruku' and prostration \nthe earth and he lifts his turban from his forehead when he \nindicates prostration. He does not prostrate on the saddle or \nanything else. He sits cross-legged if he can. The judgment of the \nresident is like the traveler when the time finds him in deep mud.  \n \n12.10c Nafila prayers while on the move  \n \nA traveler can do nafila prayers on the move while seated \non his riding animal no matter what direction the animal \nis going in,  \n \nIf he is riding on his back or in a sedan or something else. But he \nmust be riding normally. The literal words of the author would \nmean whether or not he is facing qibla when he begins the prayer, \nas opposed to the text of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthat he turns his animal to qibla first and then says the ihram \nand then prays wherever it turns. The school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) permits that at night and day as opposed to \nibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), who does not allow the traveler to \ndo nafila in the day.  \n \nHe should be seated cross-legged if possible and lift his turban \nfrom his forehead in prostration He can hit and kick the animals, \nbut should not speak nor look around. The traveler rather than \nthe resident is mentioned. The walker does not do nafila in his \njourney walking. He said, \"No matter what observe direction the \nanimal is going\" excludes someone on a ship, He does not do nafila \non it except towards qibla, and turns with it wherever it turns if \nhe can do that. The basis in what he mentioned is that is \nconfirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed on \na camel in any direction it turned, and did the witr on it, i.e. nafila \nand not the obligatory prayers. \n \n12.10d Proviso about the journey  \n \nprovided that he is on a journey for which the prayer can \nbe shortened \n  \ni.e. the precondition of the traveler doing nafila on the animal \nwherever it turns is that the journey is one in which the prayer \ncan be shortened. If it is a less shorter than that or a journey \nwhich involves disobeying Allah azza wa jall, that is not the case.  \n \n12.10e Praying the witr mounted  \n \nHe can also do the witr mounted if he wants \n  \nWith the previous preconditions. If he wants, he performs the witr \non the ground, which is preferable.  \n \n12.10f Fard prayers while traveling  \n \nHowever fard prayers, even in the case of illness, should \nonly be done on the ground unless the illness is such that \ngetting off the animal would mean that the sick person was \nforced by his illness to do the prayer sitting down using \ngestures. In this case he should pray on his animal after it \nhas been brought to a halt and made to face qibla \n  \nEven if the traveler is ill he can only pray on the earth by the \nevidence of the precious hadith. However, if he is so ill he can only \nperform prostration and bowing with gestures, then he can pray \non the animal. In the Mukhtasar there is permission without \ndislike. In the Mudawwana it is disliked. It is limited by the \ndirection he faces with his animal. If he stops and faces qibla and \nprays, there is no dislike. This qualification is transmitted by \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) from the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He said that what is in the Risala qualifies \nwhat is in the Mudawwana.  \n \n12.11 Nosebleeds  \n \n12.11a Stopping for a nosebleed \n  \nIf you have a nosebleed when you are praying behind an \nImam you should go out and wash off the blood  \n \nYou leave to wash off the blood from the nose, holding the nose \nfrom the top if you does not suspect that it will last to the need of \nthe preferred time. If you think that it will last to the end of the \npreferred time, you complete the prayer and do not go out, even if \nthe blood is flowing if you are not in a masjid, or in a masjid if you \nhave spread out something to catch the blood, or it is pebbles or \nearth with no mat on it because that is due to necessity. You wash \naway the blood when you finish. If he is in a carpeted or tiled \nmasjid, and you fear you will soil it, even less than a dirham, you \nmust stop.   \n \n12.11b Resuming the prayer  \n \nand then return and complete the prayer as long as you \nhave not spoken or stepped on any impurity \n  \nAfter washing the blood off, you complete the prayer because the \nfaqih speaks about independent judgments and the prayer is not \nstopped \nin \nthe \nfamous \nposition. \nShaikh \nibn \nal-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the best is to stop. The basis of the \nfamous position is the action of the majority of the Companions \nand Tabi'un. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \nprayer is invalid based an emergence of impurity which breaks \nwudu'. We said that it there is building on what was done. That \nhas six preconditions of which two are indicated when he \nmentioned not speaking or stepping on impurity.  \n \n12.11c Preconditions: 1. Not speaking  \n \nIt is clear that speaking invalidates it if he speaks at all: \ndeliberately, out of ignorance or forgetfulness.  \n \n12.11d Preconditions: 2. Not stepping on impurity  \n \nThe second precondition is clear because it is evident that it \ninvalidates if he steps on impurity at all, whether wet or dry. If it \nis wet it is agreed that it invalidates. If it is dry, like a skin, it is \nlike that according to Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi). As for \nthe droppings and urine of animals, he continues when he steps on \nthem by agreement because roads are not free of that in general. \nShaikh al-Hattab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He must qualify \nwhat he steps on forgetfully or by necessity for that is by its \ngenerality and spread over the road. As for walking on it \ndeliberately without excuse when the road is wide and it is not \nuniversal and there is a possibility of stepping over it, then it \nmust invalidate his prayer by the negation of the cause which is \nnecessary.  \n  \n12.11e Preconditions: 3. Proximity of water  \n \nThe third precondition is that he does not go pass water which is \nnear to other water.   \n \n12.11f Preconditions: 4. Not turning one's back on qibla  \n \nThe fourth is that he does not turn his back on qibla for other than \nseeking water. As for the seeking water, that does invalidate.   \n \n12.11g Preconditions: 5. The blood drips or flows  \n \nThe fifth is that the blood drips or flows and does not splatter. If it \nonly leaks without flowing or dripping, he does not leave to wash \nit.  \n \n12.11h Precondition: 6. It is in a group prayer  \n \nThe sixth is that the nosebleed occurs in the group prayer, \nwhether he is an Imam or follower. As for the one on his own, \nthere are two famous statements about building on it, which \nderive from whether the allowance of building is for the respect of \nthe prayer, which prevents its invalidation, or is to obtain the \nbenefit of the group.  \n \n12.11i Discounting partially completed rak'ats  \n \nYou should discount any partial rak'at you have already \nprayed unless you completed its two sajdas \n  \nIt is not counted as a rak'at if it has not been completed with its \ntwo sajdas according to what is transmitted from Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that he builds on it, be it a little or a lot. That is in the \nfirst rak'at or others. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) deduced that according to the transmission of Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), if he has a nosebleed after ruku' \nand before prostration or after one prostration, that is void and he \nbegins with the recitation.  \n \n12.11j When the bleeding is slight  \n \nIf there is only a little blood you should not leave the \nprayer but staunch the blood with your fingers except if it \nis pouring out or dripping \n  \nYou staunch it with the ends of the fingers of the left hand, and \nthe manner of staunching it is to first with the end of the thumb \nand the little finger, then the finger next to the little finger, then \nthe middle finger and then the index finger. This is unless it is \npouring out or dripping. In such a case, he does not staunch it, but \ngoes for water.   \n \n12.11k Breaking off a prayer because of vomiting or \nbreaking wudu'  \n \nYou may not, however, complete a prayer in this way if you \nhave to leave it because of vomiting or breaking wudu' \n  \n Absolutely, whether intentional or inadvertent, i.e. vomiting \nsomething impure which leaves him in the state of the prayer, \neven if a little, and the same holds true for vomiting a lot of what \nis pure. The upshot is that the prayer is not invalidated by the \npure provided that it a little and comes out usually. When it is \nimpure, even if a little, or a lot of the pure, or vomited \ndeliberately, then the prayer is invalid. The same holds true if he \nintentionally swallows it. The case is that it comes out usually. If \nhe swallows it usually in that case, there are two equal statements \nabout his prayer being invalid neither of which are preferred. That \nis not the case in the inadvertent.  \n \n12.11l When the nosebleed coincides with the salam  \n \nIf your nosebleed starts after the Imam has said the salam, \nyou say the salam and then leave the prayer-line, but if it \nstarts just before the Imam says the salam you should go \nout, wash off the blood, come back, sit down, and then say \nthe salam \n  \nIt is permitted for him to say the salam while he has the impurity \nbecause it is easier than going for water. If it is before the salam of \nthe Imam, he goes for water because if he does not leave, he \ndeliberately carries impurity in his prayer while some of it still \nremains. Then he returns and sits and repeats the tashahhud if he \nhas said it in the well-known position. If he has not said it, there \nis no dispute that he says it. His words would seem to mean that \nhe leaves to wash off the blood, even if the salam of the Imam was \nafter his nosebleed. That is not the case, If the salam of the Imam \nwas close to his nose-bleed, he says the salam and goes and his \nprayer is allowed, as in the question before it. He no longer owes \nany actions of the prayer which would have to be restored. Then \nhe goes on to make clear where the one with a nosebleed ends his \nprayer after washing off the blood with the previous preconditions.  \n \n12.11m Where to finish the prayer  \n \nIf there is no chance of catching the end of the prayer with \nthe Imam, you can complete the prayer in your house  \n \nIf he is in a group, he can complete it in his house where he \nwashed off he blood if he can or the nearest place in which he can \npray if he despairs - or thinks it probable that he will not catch the \nprayer. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said if he hopes to \ncatch any of the prayer with the Imam, even the salam, he returns \nto it. It is like that also in Mudawwana and elsewhere. Shaikh ibn \nSha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi) said if he does not hope to catch a \nrak'at, he complete the place. What was said about completing the \nprayer in any place is general to all prayers except one: Jumu'a.  \n \n12.11n If it happens in Jumu'a  \n \nexcept in the case of Jumu'a when you must complete it in \nthe masjid \n  \nThis is when he catches one rak'at with the Imam with its \nprostration‟s. He must also return if he thinks that he will catch a \nrak'at with the Imam after he returns, even if he did not catch a \nrak'at with him before the nosebleed. If he does not catch a rak'at \nbefore the nosebleed nor think that he will catch it after he \nreturns to the Imam, he does not return. He begins Dhuhr with \nihram. If he builds on his ihram, and prays four, then it is evident \nthat it is sound as Shaikh al-Hattab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \nHe must complete it in the masjid in which he began it, even if he \nthinks that the Imam has finished because the masjid is a \nprecondition for the validity of Jumu'a and it is not complete in its \ncourtyard, even if he begins there because of lack of space or \njoining the rows, as Shaikh al-Hattab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nconcludes. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat it is valid to complete it in the courtyard. Those who oblige \ncompleting it in the masjid in which he began it does not oblige \nthe exact place in which he prayed with the Imam. It is enough \nthat it is any place in it because otherwise would lead to a lot of \naction and a lot of it invalidates the prayer. If he prays in a masjid \nother than the one in which he prayed, his prayer is invalid, even \nif it is closer to him. It is clear from his words that he only \ncompletes it in the masjid, whether there is an impediment or not \nbetween him and returning to it. That is the well-known position, \nand accordingly, if something comes between him and the masjid \nin which he began it before he completes the prayer, then his \nJumu'a is invalid  \n \nAfter speaking on the nosebleed, he speaks on an earlier question \nin the chapter of purity because it is appropriate to this question.  \n \n12.12 Purity after a Nosebleed  \n \n12.12a A small amount of blood on clothes  \n \nIf there is a small amount of blood on your clothes you \nshould wash it off but you do not have to repeat the prayer \n  \nIt is a recommendation which is the agreed position since it is \nstated that blood is overlooked. Washing it refers to also to the \nbody and the place. Shaikh ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat the author meant the recommendation and so it means that \nthis is desirable and not obligatory. This is the school of the \nMudawwana , i.e. about washing off a small amount of blood, not \na large amount is recommended in the school of the Mudawwana, \ni.e. it is confirmed. This is known that the school of the \nMudawwana recommends washing off a little, not a lot. It is \ndiffers from what Shaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said about \nthe school of the Mudawwana being that it is obligatory to wash \noff a small amount of blood.  \n \n12.12b A large amount of blood  \n \nYou only have to repeat the prayer if there is a large \namount of blood \n  \nThere is a well-known disagreement about its definition and the \ndefinition of a lot. It is said that a lot in according to custom, and \nit is said that it is not. The well-known position is that a lot is the \nsize of the Baghli dirham. So whatever covers the area of the \nBaghli dirham is a lot. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nindicated that in al-'Utbiya. Shaikh ibn Sabiq (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said a that a small amount is less than a dirham and a lot \nis more than it. The position of the author is that he does not \nrepeat it, meaning within the time if he prays forgetting about it. \nIf he prays with it deliberately, he always repeats it according to \nthe position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). That is \nbecause Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is \nobligatory to remove impurities, and blood is one of them. This is \ncontrary to what is transmitted by the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) of the Bayan that the well-known position is the \ntransmission of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that removing the impurity is \nsunnah. Impurities other than blood have a different judgment \naccording to the disagreement between a little, which is \noverlooked and a lot, which is not. Fearing that someone might \nimagine otherwise, he says:  \n \n12.12c Other impurities  \n \nWith any other impurity it is immaterial whether the \namount is small or large, you have to repeat the prayer in \nany case \n  \nA small amount of any other impurity must be removed and the \nprayer always repeated when he prays it deliberately wearing an \nimpure garment, and in the time if he prays it forgetfully or by \ninability. The difference between blood and other impurities is \nthat blood cannot be guarded against because the body of man is \nlike a vessel filled with blood as opposed to other impurities which \ncan generally be avoided.  \n \n12.12d Blood from insect bites  \n \nYou do not have to wash off the blood which comes from \ninsects bites except if it is excessive \n  \nBecause washing it is great hardship and extra imposition since \nman is almost never without a little blood, which is overlooked. \nExcessive means more than normal: then it is recommended to \nwash it. It is said that it is obligatory and the definition of \nexcessive is that when it reaches a point at which he would be \nembarrassed by among people.  \n \n \n \nChapter Thirteen: On the sajdas of the Holy \nQur'an \n \n \nThe prostration‟s of the Holy Qur'an are sunnah. The decision of \nShaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) is the preferred. It is said \nthat they are meritorious. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and others said that it is well-known for the reciter and the \none who intends to listen, not the one who hears it. \n  \n13.1 Preconditions  \n \nThere are three preconditions for the prostration of the listener.  \n \nThe reciter is fit to be Imam, i.e. he is a sane, adult male in wudu'. \nHe does not prostrate when he hears an ayat of prostration recited \nby a hermaphrodite, woman, child, or someone not in wudu'. \n  \nThe listener is sitting to learn from the reciter what he needs of \nrecitation in idgham or memorization of what is recited.  \n \nThe reciter has not sat so that people can listen to the excellence \nof his recitation. He has sat to recite the words of Allah azza wa \njall or intends to let people listen for the sake of admonition and \npreventing acts of disobedience.  \n \nWhen these preconditions exist, and the reciter does not prostrate, \nthe one who intends to listen prostrates according to the well-\nknown position.  \n \n13.2 Verses where prostration is made  \n \nThere are eleven sajdas in the Holy Qur'an, these being the \nplaces where you are commanded to go into sujud. None of \nthese are in the Mufassal .  \n \nThey are called 'aza'im in Arabic to encourage that it be done out \nof fear of abandoning them which is disliked. The Mufassal are \nthose frequently separated by the basmala, the first of which is al-\nHujurat (Holy Qur‟an 49), according to some. So there is no \nprostration in an-Najm, al-Inshiqaq (Holy Qur‟an 84), and al-\nQalam (Holy Qur‟an 68).  \n \nThe first is:  \n \n1. In Surat al-A'raf, (Holy Qur’an 7:206) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (And they glorify Him and to Him they \nprostrate) which is the end of the sura.  \nIf you are doing the prayer you should go into sujud when \nyou reach this point and then recite what is easy for you \nfrom Surat al-Anfal or some other sura and then go into \nruku' and sujud.  \n \nIf you are doing a prayer, whether nafila or obligatory and recite \nit, then you prostrate for it at the moment of respect because it is \nsubject to the prayer. It is disliked to intentionally recite an ayat \nof prostration in an obligatory prayer. After prostrating, it is \nrecommended that you stand and recite some of al-Anfal or \nanother which is easy, then do ruku' as normal so that it is not \nimmediately after prostration.  \n \nThe rest are:  \n \n2. In Surat ar-Ra'd (Holy Qur’an 13:15) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (...and their shadows in the morning and the \nafternoon).  \n \n3. In Surat an-Nahl (Holy Qur’an 16:50) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (They fear their Lord above them and do what \nthey are ordered to do.)  \n \n4. In Surat al-Isra (Holy Qur’an 17:109) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (They fall on their faces weeping and it \nincreases them in humility.)  \n \n5. In Surat Maryam (Holy Qur’an 19:58) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (When the signs of the Rahman are recited to \nthem they fall down prostrating and weeping.)  \n \n6. In Surat al-Hajj (Holy Qur’an 22:18) where Allah azza wa \njall says: (Whomever Allah abases no one can ennoble. \nSurely Allah does what He wills.)  \n \n7. In Surat al-Furqan (Holy Qur’an 25:60) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (Should we prostrate to what you order us to \nprostrate to? And it makes them run even further away.)  \n \n8. In Surat an-Naml (Holy Qur’an 27:26) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (There is no god except Him, the Lord of the \nMighty Throne.)  \n \n9. In Surat as-Sajda (Holy Qur’an 32:15) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (They glorify their Lord with praise and they \nare not proud.)  \n \n10. In Surat Sad (Holy Qur’an 38:24) where Allah azza wa \njall says: (He sought forgiveness from His Lord and fell \ndown bowing and turned to His Lord in repentance.) It is \nalso said that this sajda is done after the words. (...an \nexalted place with Us and an excellent return.) (Holy \nQur’an 38:25)  \n \n11. In Surat Fusillat (Holy Qur’an 41:37) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (And prostrate to Allah who created them if it \nis indeed Him you worship.)  \n \n13.3 How the prostration is done  \n \n13.3a You must be in wudu'  \n \nYou do not do these sajdas in the Holy Qur'an unless you \nare in wudu'.  \n \nA Precondition for it is what is preconditional for the other \nprayers: purity from both major and minor impurity and facing \nqibla.  \n \n13.3b The takbir  \n \nYou say a takbir for them  \n \nIn going down and coming up by agreement if that is while he is in \nthe prayer, and in the well-known statement, if he is not in the \nprayer. It is said that it is disliked and it is said that he can \nchoose between the takbir or not doing it. Then there are three \npositions. He does not raise his hands, which is disliked in going \ndown and rising. There is no tashahhud in the well-known \nposition. It is also said that there is a tashahhud.  \n \n13.3c No salam  \n \nbut do not say the salam  \n \nThere is no salam, i.e. it is disliked unless he intends to remove \nany dispute.  \n \n13.3d The takbir on rising \n  \nThere is leeway as to whether you say 'Allahu Akbar' as \nyou come up from the sajda although we consider it \npreferable to do so.  \n \nIt a fourth position in the question in which Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) relates three positions, i.e. he has a choice \nwhen he rises, but not when he does down, as Shaikh ibn Naji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) pointed out. Do his words, 'Whether you say \n'Allahu Akbar' although we consider it preferable' refer to the \ntakbir when rising? i.e. does it mean that he says the takbir when \nrising as he does when going down so that it is the same as the \nfirst of the three positions, or does the takbir refer to rising and \ngoing down which is also the first? So in any case he chooses the \nwell-known position.  \n \n13.4 When to do or omit the prostration  \n \n13.4a In the prayers  \n \nYou should do these sajdas, if you recite the ayats where \nthey come, in both fard and nafila prayers \n  \nThese prostration‟s are done in the fard and nafila prayers, \nwhether you are the Imam or praying alone, even if it is disliked \nto recite them intentionally in the fard prayer in the well-known \nposition. It is disliked for the Imam and someone praying alone to \nrecite the prostration ayat deliberately in the fard because if he \ndoes not prostrate, he enters into the threat, and if he prostrates, \nhe increases the prostration over the obligation and that might \nlead to confusing those following. As for the nafila, it is not \ndisliked to intentionally recite the prostration ayat in them alone \nor in a group, out loud or secretly, resident or on a journey, at \nnight or day, confirmed or not confirmed, fearing to confuse the \none behind him or not.  \n \nNOTE ONE: Part of what he says about the fard and nafila is \nthat if he recites them in a khutba he does not prostrate. It is said \nthat is since there is no space in it in the order of the khutba and \nthe judgment is that reciting it is disliked. If it occurs that he \nprostrates in the khutba, it is not invalid, even if he is forbidden to \nprostrate.  \n \nNOTE TWO: If an Imam recites a prostration ayat and does not \nprostrate, then the follower leaves it. If the follower prostrates \nwhen his Imam has not done so, his prayer is invalid when that is \ndeliberate rather than inadvertent, as the prayer of the follower is \nnot invalid by not prostrating with the Imam who prostrates, even \nif he leaves it deliberately - but he has behaved badly. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that it is not disliked to recite \nit in the fard. Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn \nYunus (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn Bashir (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and others say that is correct since it is confirmed that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) continued to recite the \nprostration ayat in the first rak'at of the Subh prayer on Jumu'a. \nShaikh ibn Bashir (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Our excellent \nShaikhs and theirs used to persevere on that, and it is done at any \ntime of day or night except the Friday khutba, sunrise, when it \nbecomes yellow and daybreak. It is disliked to do it at these times. \nThere is disagreement about doing it at daybreak and yellowing \nafter praying Subh and after praying 'Asr. In the Muwatta' it is \nabsolutely not allowed after them, either in yellowing or daybreak. \nIn the Mudawwana, it is the accepted position that he can \nprostrate after it after them as long as it is not yellow or \ndaybreak. This is what the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) says.  \n \n13.4b At times when prayer is forbidden  \n \nYou should also do them if you recite any of these ayats \nafter praying Subh, provided the light is not yet bright, \nand after 'Asr provided the sun has not turned yellow \n  \nThis is a confirmed sunnah. Thus it resembles funerals. and there \nis a difference between the one who does them in the two times \nbecause of it being confirmed sunnah because the simple nafila \nare not done after 'Asr and after Subh.  \n \n \n \nChapter Fourteen: On Traveling Prayers \n \n \nIts judgment is that it is sunnah. Its reason is the journey and its \nplace is the four rak'ats prayer. One of its preconditions, which are \nfour, is the distance. It deals with of what invalidates shortening \nand questions connected to it. He indicated the first five which are \nthe description of the travel prayer and its judgment, reason, \nplace and some of its preconditions. \n  \n14.1 Travel which requires shortening the prayer  \n \n14.1a The distance  \n \nIf you travel a distance of four mail stages which is forty-\neight miles, you should shorten the prayer  \n \nThis is when you intend to make a land or sea journey which is \nobligatory, like the obligatory hajj, or desirable, like voluntary \nhajj, or permitted, like for commerce, of at least four mail stages. \nThis definition indicates the distance, and in terms of time, the \nprayer is only shortened in a journey of a day and a night by \nanimals carrying normal burdens. If he shortens before that, it is \nsaid that if it is 35 miles, he always repeats it, and in 40 he does \nnot repeat. There is some disagreement about whether he repeats \nit within the time or not. Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid in at-Tawdih that he always repeats for shortening the \nprayer in 36 miles in the school. The prayer which is shortened is \nthe obligatory prayer and the prayer which is being made up.  \n \n14.1b The number of rak'ats  \n \ndoing only two rak’ats for each except in the case of \nMaghrib which is not shortened \n \nMaghrib is odd and cannot be divided. It is also because it makes \nthe number of prayers in the day odd. Subh is not shortened \nbecause it is not established in the Shari‟ah that it is shortened, \nwhich would make it one rak'at. He is silent about Subh because it \nis not shortened. So there is consensus that Subh and Maghrib are \nnot shortened and so the journey has no effect on them.  \n \n14.1c Its preconditions  \n \nThere are preconditions for shortening:  \n \n1. The distance intended is in one go. If it is not intended, as when \nhe goes for a need which he thinks is close but ends up going a \nfurther distance. Indeed, that is the case if he is sure that it is but \nhe does not know exactly where. He does not shorten, even if he \ngoes four mail stages. Similarly he does not shorten when he stays \nin the middle of distance for the time in which it is obliged to do \nthe full prayer, like four days. To sum up, the first precondition \ncontains two things: one is the intention and the second is that it \nis in one go.  \n \nThe journey is a permissible one.  \n \nAccording to what is in ad-Dakhira, a traveler does not follow a \nresident. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said in the \nbook that he does it in full if he catches a rak'at with him. If he \ncatches less than a rak'at, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat he does not do the full prayer. The fiqh of the question is that \nif the follower is a traveler behind a resident sometimes he will \nintend the full prayer behind him and he will make his ihram like \nthat of the Imam. Sometimes he will intend the travel prayer. In \nall of this, he either catches one rak'at or not. In the first case, he \nfollows him absolutely. In the second if he catches a rak'at with \nhim, then his prayer is invalid. Otherwise it is valid and he prays \ntwo rak'ats.  \n \nHe does not turn a short journey into a long one without excuse. \n  \nHe does not shorten the prayers until he leaves the houses of the \ntown behind him.  \n \n14.1d When you can start shortening  \n \nYou are not permitted to shorten the prayer until you have \npassed beyond the houses of the town you are in so they \nare all behind you, leaving none in front of you or level \nwith you \n  \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is whether it is \na place where Jumu'a is held or not. That is the case in the well-\nknown \nposition. \nOpposite \nit \nis \nwhat \nShaikh \nMutarrif \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) related from the Imam that if the town from which the \njourney begins is a Jumu'a town, the prayer is not shortened until \nhe has gone three miles beyond its walls. Otherwise, it is from the \nend of its buildings. The place of the dispute is about adding the \ngardens when it happens that he passes the gardens. If the houses \nare separate, he must leave them all when they are united under \nthe name of 'quarter' and 'abode' or the name 'abode alone or the \nname 'quarter' when share together. Otherwise he shortens as \nsoon as he leaves his house. It is clear that they are behind him.  \n \n14.1e When you stop shortening  \n \nYou do not leave off shortening the prayers until you \nreturn to the place you set out from or come within a mile \nof it \n  \nUntil he returns to the houses or less than a mile. Shaikh ibn \n'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) is unsure of the words here. This \nphrase is unclear because at the beginning of his words he made it \nless than a mile while traveling and the last words he made him \nresident. This is not sound. Some say that the contradiction when \nhe says, \"until he returns to it.\" with \"or is near to it\" as another \nstatement means until he returns to it means until he is near \nthem. Then his words, \"or near\" mean the same. The upshot of \nthis interpretation is that if he is less than a mile, he must do the \nfull prayer, whether he is at its gardens or not. A little means a \nthird of a mile, or more.  \n \n14.1f If a traveler stays in a place for four days  \n \nIf a traveler intends to stay in a place for four days or \ntwenty prayers he should do the complete prayer until he \nmoves from that place \n  \n This is based on Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi). There are \ntwo positions. Shortening ends when he has the intention of \nstaying four full days or more if it reaches twenty prayers, and it \nis that on whose basis Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nproceeded. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) considers \nthat stopping the judgment of the journey is four full days and 20 \nprayers. So he considers that the stop which ends the judgment of \nthe journey is that he stays until the fourth 'Isha'. If someone \narrives before Fajr on a day and intends to leave after sunset on \nthe fourth, he shortens because he will not be there for the period \nof 20 prayers. Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if the intention of \nwhat he will pray in it is 20 prayers, that ends the judgment of the \njourney. The point of the dispute appears when the time of Dhuhr \ncomes. If he is able to perform the prayers according to Dhuhr of \nits day and 'Asr and he does Dhuhr and 'Asr in full. If he counts \nthe days, he voids the day in which he entered, meaning he does \nnot count it among the four days which he abides. If someone \nintends to remain for four full days, he prays in full from the time \nhe enters the place in which he intends to remain. If he enters at \nDhuhr, he does it in full and completes 'Asr and 'Isha' and the day \nhe enters is not counted among the days which he abides.  \n \nThey make an exception to the intention of remaining four days or \nmore invalidating the principle of travel is the intention of an \narmy to stop in the Abode of War. What is meant by the Abode of \nWar is the place where the army settles, even in the Abode of \nIslam when it is not secure. Another things which stops \nshortening is the knowledge of abiding by custom like the custom \nof the hajji when he enters Makka to abide for four days.  \n \n14.2 Leaving and arriving towards the end of the time of \nDhuhr and 'Asr  \n \n14.2a Leaving before praying Dhuhr and 'Asr  \n \nIf you leave a place before you have prayed Dhuhr and 'Asr \nand there is still enough daytime left to pray three rak’ats \nyou should pray them both as traveling prayers. If there is \nonly enough time to pray two rak’ats or one you should \npray Dhuhr in full and 'Asr as a traveling prayer.  \n \nIf you start to travel in this case there is agreement if he omitted \nthem by forgetfulness. The same applies is that if he left them \nintentionally but he is a sinner. If he is like that, he prays them as \ntravel prayers because he travels in their time when Dhuhr is \nestimated as two rak'ats and one rak'at of 'Asr remains. There is \ndisagreement about this estimation and whether or not one takes \npurification into account in it he is not in a state of purity. Shaikh \nal-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. \nOthers said that it, and that is the position of Shaikh ibn 'Arafa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nIf there is only enough time for two rak'ats, you pray Dhuhr in full \nbecause you became responsible for it while resident. 'Asr is \nprayed with a traveling prayer, because he was traveling in its \ntime. He begins with Dhuhr according to Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim(rahmatullahi alaihi) , which is the preferred position. He \nbegins with 'Asr according to Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) so that he does not miss it in its time, while Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he begins with whichever he \nwishes because of the disagreement of the people of knowledge on \nthat. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn Shihab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) both say that he begins with the first while \nShaikh Sa‟id ibn al-Musayyab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he \nbegins with the last.  \n \n14.2b Arriving before having prayed them  \n \nIf you return from a journey without having prayed these \ntwo prayers and there is still time for five rak’ats you do \nthem both as full prayers  \n \nIf you return from a journey and there is time for five rak'ats in \nthe day, and you have forgotten to pray Dhuhr and 'Asr, you pray \nthem as resident because you have caught their time with four of \nDhuhr and one of 'Asr. The judgment of the deliberate is the same \nas the forgetful.  \n \n14.2c When there is still time for four rak'ats  \n \nbut if there is time for four rak’ats or less down to one \nrak’at you do Dhuhr as a traveling prayer and 'Asr in full \n  \nBecause the time for Dhuhr went when you were responsible for it \nwhile traveling. 'Asr is prayed in full because he caught it while \nresident.  \n \n14.3 Arriving at the end of the time of Maghrib and 'Isha'  \n \n14.3a When you arrive and there is time for one or more \nrak'ats  \n \nIf you return during the night without having prayed \nMaghrib and 'Isha and there is still time enough before \nFajr for one or more rak’ats you pray both Maghrib and \n'Isha in full \n  \nThis is estimated, and applies whether he omitted them out of \nforgetfulness or intentionally. They are prayed in full because \nthere remains enough time to catch Isha' and so he is obliged to \npray it as a resident. As for Maghrib, there is no disagreement \nthat it is always three, either at home or on a journey.  \n \n14.3b Setting out on a journey  \n \nIf you set out on a journey and there is enough of the night \nleft to pray one rak’at or more you do Maghrib in full and \npray 'Isha as a traveling prayer \n  \nBecause he catches its time in the journey. The rule of this \nchapter in relation to the two night prayers is that it considers one \nrak'at on arrival and leaving, while in relation to the day prayers \nor one of them, on leaving if there is what is enough for three \nrak'ats, he prays the two travel prayers and two or one. The \nsecond is a travel prayer. In respect of the day prayers, if he \narrives when there remains enough of the day to pray five rak'ats, \nthen he prays them as resident. If there are four or less to one, he \nprays Dhuhr as a travel prayer. Allah knows best.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Fifteen: On the Jumu'a (Friday) \nPrayer \n \n \nIt is obligatory. He clarifies the time of its obligation and the place \nin which it must be performed and for whom it is obligatory and \nother topics connected to it. It is derived from jama' (to gather) \nsince people gather in it and the first to call it Jumu'a was Qusayy \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu). He gathered Quraysh on that day and said, \n\"This is the Day of Jumu'a.\"  \n \n15.1 It is obligatory  \n \nGoing to Jumu'a is obligatory \n  \nIt is clear that what he goes to is obligatory. The Friday prayer \nand going to it are obligatory by the Book, sunnah and consensus. \nIn the Holy Qur'an, it is the words of the Almighty, \"O you who \nbelieve! When the prayer is called on the Day of Jumu'a, rush to \nthe remembrance of Allah.\" (Holy Qur‟an 62:9) Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"Going in the Book of Allah is action. Action and doing are \nsynonyms,\" i.e. it means that rushing to remembrance means \ngoing in general, whether it is on foot or not. Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) used as evidence for that the recitation, \"go \nto the remembrance of Allah.\" What is meant by remembrance is \nthe khutba or the prayer or both as stated by the commentator of \nthe Muwatta'.  \n \nAs for the sunnah, it is what is in Sahih Muslim from what the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said about some people who \nrefrained from going to Jumu'a: \"I seriously thought about \nordering a man to lead the people in prayer and then burning \ndown the houses of certain men who failed to attend Jumu'a.\"  \n \nAs for the consensus on that, Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) stated that there is no disagreement between the Imams \nthat Jumu'a is an individual obligation. Going to it is obliged \nwhen there is no impediment. If there is an impediment, then it is \nnot obligatory. The impediment can consist of various things: \nillness which makes it hard for him to do it, when one of his \nparents is ill or near death, or he fears loss. This also applies to \nclose relative, like child or wife. Another reason is when he fears \nfor his property from a ruler, thief or arsonists. Another reason is \nsevere rain and mud, etc.  \n \n15.1a When it becomes obligatory  \n \nIt becomes obligatory when the Imam sits on the minbar \nand the mu'adhdhins begins the adhan  \n \nThe obligation to go to the Jumu'a prayer begins when the \nmu'adhdhins begin the adhan if their house is near. As for \nsomeone whose house is far, it is according to what it takes to \nreach the place where Jumu'a is held at midday. These are the \ndetails for others than those by which the Jumu'a is held. As for \nthose who make up the number by which Jumu'a is held, they are \nobliged to go so that he will hears the khutba from its beginning. \nThose in the city and a distance of three miles or less from it are \nobliged to go to it.  \n \nThe two adhans were already mentioned. Jumu'a has two adhans: \none did not exist in the time of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam), and the other did. He explains the early one.  \n \n15.2 The Sunnah of the adhan  \n \nThe early sunnah was for the mu'adhdhins to climb the \nminaret  \n \nThe desirable method is to ascend when the Imam sits on the \nminbar. This was the sunnah of the Companions since there was \nno minaret in the time of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). They used to give the adhan at the door of the masjid. \nShaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. So there was one \nadhan in the time of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwhich was done at the door of the masjid while the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was sitting on the minbar. Then 'Uthman \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) introduced another adhan which was done \nbefore that on the minbar while the Imam was also sitting on the \nminbar. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"When the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) entered the masjid, he ascended \nthe minbar and sat. Then the mu‟adhdhins gave the adhan. There \nwere three who gave the adhan on the minaret one after the other. \nWhen the third finished, the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nstood up to give the khutba. It was like that in the time of Abu \nBakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu). Then \nwhen there were a lot of people, 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \ncommanded the introduction of an earlier adhan before that which \nwas done on the minaret and it was done at midday at az-Zawra', \na place in the market, so that people could gather and leave the \nmarket. When he went out and sat on the minbar, then the \nmu'adhdhin gave the adhan on the minbar. When Hisham ibn \n'Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) was khalif, he moved the \nadhan at az-Zawra' and put it on the minaret at midday. When he \nsat on the minbar, then an adhan was given in front of him. When \nthe mu'adhdhin finished, he gave the khutba. The adhan which \n'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) introduced is done first but was the \nsecond to be prescribed, and it happens now on the minaret. That \nwhich happens before the Khatib is done second but was first to be \nprescribed because that which is now done before the Khatib was \ndone at the door of the masjid in the time of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and Hisham (rahmatullahi alaihi) changed \nit.\" What is meant by the minaret in what Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said is the place where the adhan was given \nbecause there was no minaret in the time of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and the place of the adhan was at the door \nof the masjid.  \n \n15.2b Consequences of the adhan for Jumu'a  \n \nat that point when selling or doing anything else which \nmight distract you from going to Jumu'a becomes haram \n  \nWhen the adhan is given before the imam, then selling becomes \nunlawful for everyone for whom Jumu'a is obligatory except the \none who is compelled to it as when it happens that the call for \nJumu'a is given and he cannot find water with which to purify \nhimself except by buying it. So both are allowed to buy and sell \nbecause this is part of mutual help to worship. Other distracting \nthings are forbidden: like eating, sewing, traveling, the gift, \nsadaqa and taking by a pre-preemption.  \n \n15.2c Giving an earlier adhan  \n \nThe calling of an earlier adhan is a practice which was \nintroduced by the Banu Umayya \n  \nIt was introduced by 'Uthman ibn „Affan (radhi‟Allahu anhu).  \n \n15.3 Preconditions for Jumu'a  \n \nKnow that Jumu'a has preconditions for its being obligatory, and \npreconditions for its performance. The difference between them is \nthat the preconditions for obligation are those by which \nresponsibility arises and the legally responsible person is not \nrequired to achieve them. The preconditions for performance are \nthose by which responsibility is removed and it is obligatory for \nthe responsible person to obtain them.   \n \n15.3a Preconditions for its being obligatory  \n \nThey are ten:  \n \nAnnouncement of the time  \n \nIslam  \n \nAdulthood  \n \nSanity  \n \nMaleness  \n \nBeing free  \n \nResidence  \n \nHealth  \n \nNearness so that he is not more than three miles away - or \nquarter or a third of a mile more.  \n \nThat it be a settled place.  \n \n15.3b Preconditions for performance  \n \nThey are four:  \n \nThe Imam \n  \nThe group  \n \nThe masjid  \n \nThe khutba.  \n \nThe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned some of these \nconditions and he did not distinguish them from one another.  \n \n15.3c The required size of the town  \n \nJumu'a is obligatory if there is a large enough town and a \nlarge enough group of people in it \n  \n It is clear from the school of Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the Jumu'a is only held in the city. Some of his \ncompanions added that it should be in a city in which the Imam \nhas established the hudud. The school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is held in the city and in the town \nwhere buildings are connected, even if their connection is only be \nbenefit in that they help one another, even the hudud are not \nestablished there. On this basis, the words of the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) must be interpreted that it is said that he \nmeant by town of connected buildings the category of towns.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it should be in the \noldest masjid of the locality.  \n \n15.3d The group  \n \nThe second is a precondition for validity, i.e. for establishing the \nJumu'a there must be a group. They do not give the number with \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), but what is meant is the \nexistence of those who are independent in terms of defense and \nmutual help in things necessary for life. When they can remain \nindefinitely with security and the power to defend themselves, \nthen the Jumu'a is valid, even if there are only twelve men \nremaining to complete the prayer with the Imam. There is no \ndifference between the first Jumu'a and others.  \n \n15.3e The khutba  \n \nThere must be a khutba before the prayer \n  \nIt is obligatory in the famous position, and it is said that it is \nsunnah. They are both related in the preferences. It is a \nprecondition of validity because it is not transmitted that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed Jumu'a without a khutba. \nIf they pray without a khutba, then they repeat it within the time. \nIf they do not repeat until the time has gone, they repeat it as \nDhuhr.  \n \n15.4 Preconditions for the khutba  \n \n15.4a Khutba before the prayer  \n \nThere are preconditions for the validity of the khutba. The author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) indicates them, beginning with the khutba \nbefore the prayer since the Almighty says, \"Then when the prayer \nis finished spread through the earth.\" (Holy Qur‟an 62:10) The fa' \nis for the order and consequence. It does not deny that people \ndisperse after the prayer and it is not incompatible with its being \nafter the khutba if the khutba is after the prayer. \"Afterness' is a \nwide preposition. That is what was done by him (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) and the Rightly-guided khalifs after him. Whoever is \nignorant and prays before the khutba repeats the prayer only. One \nprecondition is that it is after midday. One of them is that it is in \nthe presence of the group by whom the Jumu'a is constituted. One \nof them is that it is two khutbahs. If there is one khutba and then \nhe prays, the Jumu'a is repeated after the second khutba. The \nseparation between the two khutbahs by the prayer is slight, and \nso it does not oblige the invalidation of the first khutba.  \n \nThe least of what satisfies the khutba in the well-known position \nis that to which khutba is applied to by the Arabs. It is a form of \nrhymed words different from poetry or prose. For it to be done not \nin Arabic is null. If no one can be found who knows Arabic, then it \nis canceled. It is said that its minimum is \"Alhamdulillah\" and the \n“prayer on the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) \" and cautioning \nand good news. This is weak since the accepted position is that \nthey are recommended in the two khutbahs. Another precondition \nit is that it is out loud. If it is silent it is null. There are two well-\nknown positions about whether purification is a precondition for \nits validity. One of them if that purification is not a precondition \nand it is disliked without it.  \n \n15.4b Leaning on a bow or staff and sitting in the middle  \n \nDuring the khutba the Imam should lean on a bow shaft or \na staff. He should sit before the start of the khutba and in \nthe middle of it \n  \nWhile he is giving his khutba, it is recommended that he lean on a \nbow shaft or staff. He sits at the beginning of the khutba and in \nthe middle. There is disagreement about this and in standing for \nit. Shaikh al-Maziri (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that standing for it \nis obligatory and a precondition, It is said that it is a sunnah. If he \ngives the khutba sitting it is valid, but he behaves badly. So both \nof the first and second sitting are sunnah in the well-known \nposition. The length of the middle sitting is that of the sitting \nbetween the two prostration‟s. The basis in what he mentioned is \nthat it continues to be the action in all cities and times from the \ntime of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) until now.  \n \n15.4c After the khutba  \n \nThe prayer is performed when the khutba is over \n  \nIt is a precondition to connect the prayer to the khutba, and a \nshort gap is overlooked as opposed to a large one. It is obliged as a \nprecondition that the Imam of the prayer is the Khatib. If \nsomething prevents his Imamate, like breaking wudu', or a \nnosebleed, and water is near, the prayer must wait for him. If it is \nfar, he delegates someone, and it is desirable that he delegates \nsomeone who was at the khutba.   \n \n15.5The Rak'ats of Jumu'a  \n \n15.5a Two rak'ats done out loud  \n \nThe prayer consists of two rak’ats in which the Imam \nrecites out loud \n  \nThere is agreement that the prayer is two rak'ats. If it is \ndeliberately more, it is invalid. If he adds out of oversight, then he \nproceeds on the basis of having added something to the prayer. \nThe Imam must intend to be the Imam. Otherwise the intention is \nnot adequate. It is recommended to perform the prayer at the \nbeginning of the time. Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat there is no one disagrees that the beginning of its time is \nmidday. The well-known position is that it extends until sunset.  \n \n15.5b Recitation in it  \n \nIn the first rak’at he should recite Surat al-Jumu'a (Holy \nQur’an 62) or something similar and in the second Surat al-\nGhashiya (Holy Qur’an 88) or something similar \n  \nThere is consensus that recitation in it is out loud. In the first \nrak'at after the Fatiha he recites Surat al-Jumu'a (Holy Qur‟an \n62). Shaikh ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) objects to \"or \nsomething similar\" since it is recommended to recite Surat al-\nJumu'a (Holy Qur‟an 62) in it since it contains the rules of Jumu'a \nand because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to \nrecite it at the first rak'at. The answer to that objection is that he \nmeans to refute the one who said that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) only recited it in Jumu'a. In Sahih Muslim we \nread that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) recited al-A'la \n(Holy Qur‟an 87) in the first rak'at., There is no objection to the \nfact that in the second rak'at it is recommended that he recite \nSurat al-Ghashiya (Holy Qur‟an 88) or its like.  \n \n15.6 The obligation of Jumu'a  \n \n15.6a Its obligatory nature  \n \nGoing to Jumu'a is obligatory for anyone in the town or \nwithin three miles of it \n  \nIt is agreed that it is obligatory if he meets the preconditions of \nthe Jumu'a and has no legitimate impediment, as it is obligatory \nfor those outside the city within three miles. That is the position of \nShaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn \nal-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated it. Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others say that the distance begins from \nthe masjid. That is the position of the author of al-'Umda. He \ndeduced that because the definition of three miles is by hearing, \nand hearing related to the minaret. If it is said that it is not \nobliged if it is more, that is the position of Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). What is relied on is the transmission of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), that three miles is \napproximate and so it is obliged for those a little beyond it, like a \nthird or quarter of a mile. Then he indicates the preconditions of \nJumu'a:  \n \n15.6b Those for whom it is not obligatory  \n \nIt is not obligatory for travelers nor is it obligatory for the \npeople at Mina nor for slaves, women or children \n  \nIt is agreed that it is not obligatory for the traveler, nor for the \npeople of Mina other than its inhabitants. It is obligatory for its \ninhabitants when they have a sufficient number for Jumu'a, \nwhether they are Hajjis or not. Nor is it obligatory for women or \nchildren by agreement. The basis in what was mentioned is what \nShaikh at-Tabarani (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in al-Kabir from \nthe words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"Jumu'a is \nobligatory for every Muslim except four - a owned slave, a woman, \na child, and someone who is ill.\" If those for whom it is not \nobligatory he attends it and prays, it suffices for Dhuhr.  \n \n15.6c When a slave or woman is present  \n \nIf a slave or a woman does attend they should do the \nJumu'a prayer \n  \nMeaning it is sufficient for Dhuhr. In the case of the traveler, it is \nsufficient for Dhuhr according to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it \nis not sufficient for him because he is not responsible for it. The \nnafila does not satisfy the fard.   \n \n15.6d Where women stand  \n \nWomen should be behind the rows of the men. Young \nwomen should not go to Jumu'a \n  \n15.6e The obligation to listen to the Imam  \n \nIt is obligatory to listen to the Imam while he is giving the \nkhutba \n  \nIt is obligatory for everyone who attends the Jumu'a to be silent \nand listen to the Imam while he is giving the first and second \nkhutbahs and in the sitting between them, whether he can hear \nthe khutba or whether the Imam abuses someone he is not \npermitted to abuse or praises someone he is not permitted to \npraise. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that words \nare permitted if the Imam says something which is not permitted. \nShaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that is correct. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar confines himself to \nit. One does bless the sneezer and he says “Praise be to Allah\" \nsilently in himself. One does not greet nor return a greeting, even \nby indication. One does not drink water. In short, he is forbidden \nanything incompatible with the obligation of being silent, even for \nthe one who is not listening. The basis for that is the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) in the two Sahih collections: \n\"Even saying, 'Be quiet!' to your companion while the Imam is \nspeaking on the Day of Jumu'a constitutes foolish chatter.\" If \ncommanding to the correct is called foolish talk, so that applies \neven more to other things. 'Foolish talk' is speech in which there is \nno good.  \n \nAmong the times when speech is permitted is the time when he \nasks for blessing for the Companions and supplication for the \nruler. It is permitted to speak during the khutba for certain \nmatters which include a little dhikr when there reason for it, \nsaying 'Amin' with listening to forgiveness or rescue from the Fire, \nseeking refuge when hearing the Fire and Shaitan mentioned, and \nthe prayer on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) when he  is \nmentioned. All that is silent and disliked out loud.  \n \n15.6f Sitting facing the Imam  \n \nand you should sit facing him  \n \nThe people face the Imam while he is giving the khutba, and all \nrows are the same in this. What Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says about the first row not having to do that is weak.  \n \n15.7 Other points related to Jumu'a  \n \n15.7a Ghusl  \n \nIt is also necessary to do a ghusl before going to Jumu'a \n  \nGhusl for the Jumu'a prayer is obligatory, not for the day. It is \npart of the adab of the prayer. It is obligatory as a confirmed \nsunnah. Its time is before the Jumu'a prayer. It must be connected \nto going out to the Jumu'a in the well-known position. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if he washes after Fajr, that \nis enough, even if it is not connected to going out. It is performed \nthe same as the ghusl on account on janaba.  \n \n15.7b Going early to the masjid  \n \nIt is recommended to get to the masjid early but not right \nat the beginning of the day \n  \nOne of the adab of Jumu'a is to go early. It is recommended \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and the \nCompanions used to do that, i.e. they went to the masjid at this \ntime. The first of what satisfies it is the sixth meant where the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) says, \"Whoever washes on \nthe Day of Jumu'a and then goes in the first hour, it is as if he \noffered a camel.\" It is not at the beginning of the day for that is \ndisliked because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did not \ndo it and none of the Companions did it.  \n \n15.7c Perfume and best clothes  \n \nIt is also good to put on perfume and dress in your best \nclothes \n  \nIt is recommended that perfume be put on for it. One of the adab \nof the Jumu'a is to use perfume for the one who attends it - men \nbut not women. It is perfume whose color is hidden and scent is \ndiscerned, like musk. By it he intends to obey the sunnah and does \nnot intend boasting and showing off.  \n \nOne of the adab is to deck oneself in one's best lawful clothes. It is \nthat which the people of the Shari‟ah consider good on this day, \nFriday: it is white. The basis is in what Abu Dawud (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) related from the hadith of Abu Hurayra (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nwhere the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"\"If anyone \nbathes on Jumu'a, puts on his best clothes, applies on scent in his \nhouse if he has any, then comes to Jumu'a, and takes care not to \nstep over the necks of people, then prays what was prescribed for \nhim and then keeps silent when the Imam comes out until he \nfinishes his prayer, it will expiate for what happened in the \nprevious week.\" Abu Hurayra (radhi‟Allahu anhu) says \"And three \ndays more.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) says, \"The good actions is \nmultiplied ten times.\"  \n \n15.7d Leaving without doing nafila  \n \nWith us it is preferred that you should leave after finishing \nthe prayer without doing any nafila rak’ats in the masjid \n  \nThe Malikis prefer that one who prays Jumu'a leave after \nfinishing the tasbih and the like connected to it and not do any \nnafila in the masjid, whether Imam or follower. It is like that by \nagreement about the Imam. According to one statement about the \nfollower, i.e. it is part of the adab that the one who prays Jumu'a \nleave after the prayer and not do any nafila is based it being is \nrelated that Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) prayed \nJumu'a and left and prayed two rak'ats in his house. Then he said, \n'The Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) used to do this with nafila \nafter them.\" As for before, it is permitted for the follower rather \nthan the Imam, i.e. desirable.  \n \n15.7e Nafila before Jumu'a  \n \nYou can do nafila rak’ats before Jumu'a \n  \nThe one who is a follower in the masjid can do nafila before \nJumu'a if he wishes as long as the Imam has not sat on the \nminbar. If he sits, then there is no nafila. When he comes out for \nthe khutba, he does not do nafila. When he enters while he is \ndoing nafila, he makes it quick.  \n \n15.7f The Imam does not do nafila  \n \nThe Imam should not do any nafila rak’ats before the \nprayer but should go straight to the minbar when he comes \nin \n  \nThe Imam does not do nafila before Jumu'a in the masjid, i.e. it is \ndisliked for the Imam since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did not pray before Jumu'a at all. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that that is the same whether there is \nample time or not.  \n \nThe recommended adab include trimming the mustache and nails, \nplucking the armpits, shaving the pubes when that is needed, \nusing the tooth-stick and walking to the prayer based on what is \nreported about that in traditions.  \n \n \n \nChapter Sixteen: On the Fear Prayer \n \n \n16.1 Its Judgment  \n \nShaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is possible to \ndefine it as doing one of the five fard prayers. Its judgment is \nobligatory, i.e. obligatory as a sunnah. Shaikh ibn al-Mawwaz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is an allowance and the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar confines himself to the \ntruth of the allowance for it, a which is the legal principle of the \nexcuse which allows what is forbidden, like eating carrion. It is \nprescribed by an excuse, which is necessity while confirming the \nexistence of the forbidden, which is foulness in carrion. By analogy \nhe says here that it is prescribed for an excuse, which is fear, with \nthe establishment of the forbidden, which is altering the \nprescribed prayer.  \n \nThere is no contradiction between its being sunnah and its being \nan allowance because the allowance can become an obligation: like \neating carrion for one so compelled. The evidence for the \nconfirmation of its judgment and that it is not abrogated is the \nBook, the sunnah and consensus. Shaikh al-Muzani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) claims that it is abrogated, but that is rejected. As for its \nevidence in the Book, it is the words of the Almighty, \"When you \nare with them\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:102) In the sunnah, part of it is \nwhat Yazid ibn Ruman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) related with his isnad \nthat a group prayed with the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  \nwhile a group faced the enemy. He (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed \none rak'at with them and then remained standing and they led \nthemselves. Then they went and faced the enemy and the other \ngroup came and he led them in the remaining rak'at and then \nremained sitting and they led themselves. Then he said the salam \nwith them. As for consensus, a group of the Companions prayed it \nafter the death of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nincluding 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (radhi‟Allahu anhu), Abu Hurayra \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu), and Abu Musa (radhi‟Allahu anhu), and none \nof the Companions objected to it. It was done on journeys and \nwhile resident, singly and in groups.  \n \n16.2 When it is done on a journey  \n \nThe fear prayer is done when traveling if there is fear of \ntrouble from an enemy \n  \nThe fear prayer is done when the Muslims fear the enemy, i.e. \nthey believe or think that there is harm from the enemy. What is \nmeant are the unbelievers because fighting them allowed, and \nthere is an analogy made to include revels.  \n \n16.2a Beginning the Fear Prayer  \n \nThe Imam steps forward with one group leaving the other \ngroup to face the enemy \n  \nAs in al-Mukhtasar, whether the enemy is in qibla or not. It is like \nthat as opposed to Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) who said \nthat if the enemy is in the direction of the qibla, they all pray with \nthe Imam without any division since they see the enemy. It is not \na precondition that the two groups be equally divided as opposed \nto the one who makes that a precondition. The sound version is \nthat each group should have power to resist the enemy. If the \nenemy can be resisted by half, they are divided in two halves. If \nthey can be resisted with a third, he prays with a third the first \nrak'at, and with two-thirds in the second. According to the Imam \nhe informs people how it will be done they begin the prayer to \navoid confusions since most people are not familiar with it.  \n \n16.2bThe first group  \n \nHe prays one rak’at with this group and then remains \nstanding while they pray a second rak’at by themselves. \nThey then say the salam and go and stand where their \ncompanions were standing \n  \nHe leads the group in prayer and remains on his own and then \nthey leave him. If that happens deliberately before he is on his \nown, then their prayer is invalid. When he is on his own, he can \nchose between standing between recitation, supplication or \nsilence. Then they pray a rak'at on their own, say the salam and \ngo to replace the second group in facing the enemy.  \n \n16.2c The second group  \n \nThis second group then come and do the takbir al-ihram. \nThe Imam prays his second rak’at with them and then does \nthe tashahhud and says the salam whereupon they pray \ntheir second rak’at and finish their prayer \n  \nThen the second group say the ihram and stand behind the Imam \nwho prays the second rak'at. The Imam says the tashahhud and \nsalam in the well-known position. A counter view it is that he does \nnot say the salam, but indicates to the second group to stand for \nthe second rak'at which they owe and pray it, and he says the \nsalam for it. So they catch the salam with him as the first group \ncaught the ihram. The well-known position is that the Imam says \nthe salam and does not wait for the second group who pray with \nhim one rak'at and left the Imam. They make up the rak'at they \nmissed with him and finish.  \n \n16.2d The case of Maghrib  \n \nThis is what is done for all the fard prayers except \nMaghrib when the Imam prays two rak’ats with the first \ngroup and one with the second \n  \nIn Maghrib, the Imam prays two rak'ats and says the tashahhud. \nAfter he has said the tashahhud, he stands and remains so \naccording to the well-known position and indicates to the first \ngroup to stand. Then they stand and complete their prayer on \ntheir own. They say the tashahhud and the salam and leave and \ntake the place of their companions. Then the second group come \nand say the ihram behind him and he leads them in praying a \nrak'at and then says the tashahhud and salam. Then they finish \nthe two rak'ats they missed with the Fatiha and sura and then \nthey go. This description which the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentions is the well-known one from the position of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and he considers it sound that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it.  \n \nIt was two preconditions: the first is that the fighting is permitted, \ni.e. allowed, and it includes the obligatory, like fighting the people \nof shirk and rebellion, and the permitted, like fighting those who \ndesire property and that those who pray with Imam can leave. If \nthe enemy is such that they cannot resist the ambush, then the \nsecond is not permitted when the fear ends in the course of the \nprayer. They complete it with the quality of security. If there is \nsecurity after the prayer, it is not repeated. This is the description \nof the fear prayer when traveling.  \n \n16.3 When it is done while Resident  \n \n16.3aWhen there is danger  \n \nIf an Imam is leading the prayer in a situation of great \ndanger for a group of people who are not traveling, he \nprays two rak’ats with each group for Dhuhr, 'Asr, and \n'Isha \n  \nWhen they are resident, the Imam can lead them in the fear \nprayer. The expression of Shaikh al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi) is \nclearer than this: \"When there is fear in the resident prayer, it is \nnot permitted to shorten the prayer, but it is permitted to divide \nthe people. So the Imam leads one of the two groups in two rak'ats \nand sits and does the tashahhud and then indicates them to stand \nto complete it. It is said that he stands when he finishes his \ntashahhud and waits for them to finish and go and the others to \ncome, standing, silent or making supplication, not reciting. Then \nhe prays the remaining two rak'ats with the second group. Then \nhe says the salam and they finishes what they misses after the \nsalam, It is said that he waits for them to make up what they \nmissed and then says the salam, and they say the salam with his \nsalam, but the first is the well-known.  \n \n16.3b The adhan and iqama  \n \nThe adhan and the iqama are done for each prayer \n  \nTraveling and when resident in a group. This is because every \nprayer is an obligation absolutely in the journey, and when \nresident.   \n \n16.4 The Fear Prayer done alone  \n \nIf the situation is too dangerous for even this, then \neveryone should pray individually as best they can, either \non foot or horseback, walking or running, and whether \nfacing the qibla or not \n  \nIf it is too dangerous for a group prayer, then they pray \nindividually as best they can in ruku' and prostration. If they \ncannot do that, they use gestures to indicate prostration lower \nthan bowing. They can be on foot or mounted on horses or camels, \nwalking or running, facing qibla or not. Then they do not have to \nrepeat it when they are safe, wither in the time or after it. The \nbasis for what he mentioned is the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"If \nyou fear an enemy, then pray on foot or riding,\" (Holy Qur‟an \n2:239) and His words, \"Remember Allah standing and sitting and \nlying on your sides. When you are safe again do the prayer in the \nnormal way.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:103) So Allah Almighty commands \nthat you pray the prayer in its time according to the situation. In \nthe Muwatta', Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"When fear is intense, then pray, standing, and on foot or riding, \nfacing qibla or not.\" Nafi' (radhi‟Allahu anhu) ) said, \"I do not \nthink 'Abdullah (radhi‟Allahu anhu) mentioned that except from \nthe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam).\"  \n \nNOTE: It is permitted in a state of intense fear to walk a lot and \nto rush, which is to move the foot, jab with the spear, and shoot \nthe arrow and speech, even if it is a lot if he needs to do that in \nwhat is connected to them, like warning someone about someone \nwho is aiming at him, telling him to kill him, glorification and \nboasting when shooting, or rajaz poetry if he prepares that to \nweaken the enemy. Otherwise there is no need for it.  \n \n \n \nChapter Seventeen: On the two ‘Id prayers and \nthe takbirs on the days of Mina \n \n \nThis is Fitr and Adha. He clarifies the time for going out to them \nand how they are done, and clarifies the path by which one \nreturns from them and what he does and what he says when he \ngoes out to them. He also explains the takbirs in the days of Mina \nand the time in which the takbir occurs on the days of Mina and \nclarifies what it is recommended to do on the day of the „Id. He \nbegins with their judgment. \n  \n17.1 Its judgment  \n \nPraying the two ‘Id prayers is an obligatory sunnah \n  \nWhat is meant is that both of them are confirmed sunnah‟s. So it \nis a confirmed sunnah and is an individual sunnah in respect of \nthe one obliges to go to Jumu'a: a legally responsible free man, etc. \nIt is not sunnah for a slave, child, madman, women or traveler. \nThe traveler is the one who is more than three miles outside the \nland of Jumu'a, but it is recommended for the one who is not \ncommanded to it to pray it. So it is desirable for the slave, woman, \nchild and the one a residing outside the land of Jumu'a although \nthere is an exception for the hajji traveler at Mina. They are not \ncommanded to establish it nor is it desirable or sunnah because \nthe standing at the Mash'ar takes the place of his praying Jumu'a. \nAs for the people of Mina, their praying for it in a group is a \nblameworthy innovation. There is no harm in a man praying it for \nhimself. It is recommended for someone who misses the „Id prayer \nwith the Imam to pray it alone. If a woman goes to it, she does not \nwear clothes meant to attract people's attention nor does she put \non perfume out of fear of sedition, i.e. doing that is unlawful is the \nfear is probable, and it is disliked if it is uncertain. The old woman \nand others are equal in this.   \n \n17.2 How to do the prayer  \n \n17.2a The time of setting out  \n \nThe Imam and the people should leave for the prayer early \nin the morning so that by the time they arrive at the \nprayer place the time for the prayer has come \n  \nThe time for setting out for the „Id prayer for the Imam and people \nis after sunrise so when they reach the place of prayer, it is time \nfor the prayer. This is for the one whose house is near. As for the \none whose house is far, he leaves before that so that he can catch \nthe prayer with the Imam. This is the clarification of the time of \nsetting out, not the time of the prayer which he mentions: when he \narrives, it is the time of the prayer.  \n \nIts time is when the sun is the height of one or two Arab spears, \nwhich is 12 spans, by the medium span. This is relation to what \nthe eye sees. In actual terms, it is when the sun traverses the \ndistance which only Allah azza wa jall knows. It is recommended \nto go out for it to the place of prayer. Makka and other places are \nthe same in that. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \npeople of Makka prayed in the Masjid al-Haram, i.e. in sight of the \nKa'ba. It is an act of worship lacking elsewhere. It is reported that \nevery day 120 mercies descend on this House, 60 for those doing \ntawaf, 40 for those praying, and 20 for those looking at it.  \n \nIt is recommended to walk when going to the „Id prayers rather \nthan returning because he has finished an act of nearness. It is \nrecommended to eat before going to the prayer on the „Id al-Fitr \nbut not the „Id al-Adha.  \n \n17.2b No adhan or iqama  \n \nThere is no adhan or iqama for the ‘Id prayers \n  \nIn the well-known position there is no call for the prayer to gather \nbased on what is found in Sahih Muslim from 'Ata' (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu). Jabir (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  reported that there is no adhan \non the Day of Fitr before the Imam goes out nor after he goes out \nand there is no iqama or call in the masjid of the prayer and \nnothing is done to announce the prayer, like beating a drum, for \ninstance. When there time comes, there is no adhan or iqama or \ncall. The Imam simply begins the prayer. \n \n17.2c Two rak'ats recited out loud  \n \nThe Imam leads the prayer in two rak’ats, reciting out loud \nin each of them \n  \nHe leads the people by reaching the place of prayer or the masjid \nafter the nafila when the people are gathered. He prays two \nrak'ats based on what is in the two Sahih collections that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed it as two rak'ats. It was \nlike that with the khalifs after them. There is no disagreement \nthat he recites out loud.  \n \n17.2d What is recited  \n \nIn both he recites the Fatiha and a sura such as Surat al-\nA'la (Holy Qur’an 87) or Surat ash-Shams (Holy Qur’an 91) \n  \nAccording to what is in the Muwatta and Sahih Muslim the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) used to recite Qaf (Holy Qur‟an \n87) and al-Qamar (Holy Qur‟an 54) in Adha and Fitr.   \n \n17.2e The takbirs  \n \nIn the first rak’at he says seven takbirs including the \ntakbir al-ihram. In the second he says five takbirs not \nincluding the takbir for standing up from sajda \n  \nHe does not raise his hands in any takbir, either in the first or \nsecond except the takbir al-Ihram in the well-known position. It is \nreported from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he \nrecommended it in every takbir. The takbirs are connected to each \nother except for the amount of the takbir of those following. It is \ndesirable for him to separate them by that amount. If the Imam \nsays the takbir more than seven in the first or more than five in \nthe second, the follower does not follow him, even if that is the \nschool of the Imam. He says the takbir before recitation, even if \nthe school of the Imam is to delay, as the literal evidence of the \npeople of the School indicates. If the Imam forgets a takbir of the \n„Id prayer, he goes back as long as he has not moved into ruku'. \nWhen he places his hands on his knees, he does not go back. If he \ngoes back, some of them deduce that it is not invalid and others \ndeduce that it is invalid. The reason for that is he returns from a \nfard to a Sunnah.  \n \nIf he places his hands on his knees having missed a takbir \ninadvertently, he continues and prostrates before the salam. \nAnyone who comes after the Imam has finished the takbirs and \nfinds him reciting, says that the takbir in the well-known position \nas opposed to Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi). He said it is \nbecause he becomes someone who is making up in the judgment of \nthe Imam. The opinion of the one with the well-known position is \nthat he is not making up by the insignificance of the matter.  \n \nIt is like that when he catches of the takbirs. He says the takbir \nwith him for what he caught of it and then completes what \nremains of the Imam beginning the recitation. He does not say \nthat takbir for what he has missed in the takbirs of the Imam. If \nhe finds him in the ruku', he says the takbir al-ihram and owes \nnothing. If he catches the recitation in the second rak'at, he says \nfive takbirs since the takbir of standing is canceled for him. When \nhe makes up the first, he says the takbir seven times counting the \ntakbir of standing in them since he missed the takbir al-ihram.  \n \n17.2f Tashahhud  \n \nThere are two sajdas in each rak’at and the prayer is \ncompleted with the tashahhud followed the salam \n  \nAfter the two prostration‟s comes the tashahhud, i.e. the prayer on \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and supplication. He \nincludes all of it. There is the salam after the tashahhud.  \n \n17.2g The khutba  \n \nThe Imam then gets up onto the minbar and gives a \nkhutba. He sits before it begins and again in the middle \n  \nAfter finishing the salam, the Imam goes up the minbar. So the \nkhutba is after the prayer. The khutba of the „Id is not like that of \nJumu'a in respect to time. This is after the prayer and the other is \nbefore the prayer. Nor in respect of beginning. This begins with \ntakbir and that with praise and the prayer on the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). It is like it inasmuch as they are both in \nArabic and out loud: that is necessary in both. The text of the \nMukhtasar states that it is recommended that the khutba be after \nthe prayer based on what is in the Sahih that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) used to begin with the prayer before the \nkhutba and this was the action of the Rightly-guided khalifs after \nhim. He sits at the beginning and middle of it because they are \ntwo khutbahs within the whole khutba according to the judgments \nof the „Id and what is prescribed it in is obligatory and \nrecommended.  \n \n17.2h After the khutba  \n \nWhen it is finished he leaves \n  \nThe Imam then leaves without sitting down after he finishes the \nkhutba if he wishes. He can stay where he is. It is disliked for him \nand those following him to do nafila before it and after it if it is \ndone in the desert based on what is in the two Sahih collections \nthat the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) went out on the Day of \nal-Adha and prayed two rak'ats without not praying before or \nafter them. If it is performed in a masjid, it is not disliked either \nfor him or those following to do nafila before or after it according \nto Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) because the hadith \nhas described the desert.  \n \n17.2i How to return home  \n \nIt is recommended for him to return by a different route \nfrom the one he came by and this applies to everyone else \nas well \n  \nThe Imam should return by a different route since it is affirmed \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to do that. This \nis true for people because they are the same in this. As the Imam \nshould return by a different route, so those who follow do so since \nthe wisdom applies to all.  \n \n17.3 On ‘Id al-Adha  \n \nIf it is the ‘Id al-Adha (sacrifice) the Imam should bring his \nsacrificial animal to the prayer-place and slaughter it \nthere so that everyone else can slaughter their animals \nafter him \n  \nWhen the Imam goes to the „Id prayer on the Day of Sacrifice, he \nshould bring his animal to the prayer-place and slaughter it so \nthat people will know and they can go and slaughter after him \nsince they are not be permitted to slaughter before him. If \nsomeone slaughters before him, it is agreed that he must repeat it. \nIf the Imam does not bring his animal to the prayer-place, they \nslaughter after he returns to his home and that it enough for \nthem, even if they err and actually slaughter before him.  \n \n17.4 Dhikr on the Way to the Prayer  \n \nOn both the ‘Id al-Fitr and the ‘Id al-Adha the Imam should \ndo dhikr Allah out loud from the time he leaves his house \nuntil he arrives at the prayer-place. Everyone else does the \nsame continuing until the arrival of the Imam when they \nstop \n  \nIt is recommended for the Imam or others to say the takbir when \nthey leave the house. It is understood from his words that he does \nnot say the takbir before he leaves. It is the well-known position. \nThere is the position that the beginning of the time of takbir \nbegins from sunset on the night of the „Id. That is for the „Id al-\nFitr and „Id al-Adha. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat he does not say the takbir for the „Id al-Fitr. His evidence is \nwhat ad-Daraqutni (radhi‟Allahu anhu) related that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to say the takbir of the Day \nof Fitr when he (alaihi salat wa salam) left his house until he \ncomes to prayer place. That was the action of the people of Madina \nas opposed to the Salaf. It is clear that the words of the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he says the takbir whether he leaves \nbefore or after sunrise. It is stated by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) in al-Mabsut. Some of them transmit that that which \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says in al-Mabsut is that the \ntakbir is from the time of leaving the Subh prayer. Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi), who has most appropriate \nposition, said that that especially applies to Adha to achieve \nresemblance with the people of the Mash'ar. This takbir is out \nloud according to most scholars so that he hears himself as do \nthose near him and a little beyond that. Shaikh al-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) went out on the Day of Fitr and Adha, raising his voice in \nthe takbir and that continued to be the action of the Salaf. When \nhe reaches the prayer-place, that is the end of the takbir of the \nImam.  \n \nWhat is meant by the people doing it is that they do the same as \nthe Imam in beginning the takbir and its description. In the end, \nthey differ from him because they stop the takbir when he reaches \nits place.  \n \n17.4a When the Imam says that takbir in the khutba  \n \nEvery time the Imam says the takbir during his khutba \neveryone else should repeat it to themselves. Otherwise \nthey should remain silent and pay attention \n  \nSilently. According to the School, a group of the Companions did \nthat. They are silent for other than the takbir according to Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi), in the transmission of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), because they must listen and it \nresembles Jumu'a.  \n \n17.5 Saying \"Allahu Akbar\" on the Days of Mina  \n \n17.5a Takbirs after the prayers  \n \nDuring the 'days of sacrifice' you should do the takbir \nstraight after each fard prayer starting with Dhuhr on the \nday on the ‘Id and ending with Subh on the fourth day, this \nbeing the last of the days of Mina \n  \nIt is recommended for the people to say the takbirs after the fard \nprayers before the tasbih, praise and takbirs. It is evident from his \nwords that the Imam, the followers, and the one on his own, male \nand female, are all equal in that. He mentions the fard rather \nthan the nafila, and the present rather than the missed prayer. \nThe takbirs begin at Dhuhr and end with Subh on the fourth day \nafter the sacrifice  \n \n17.5b Form of takbir  \n \nThe form of this takbir which is done after the prayers is: \n'Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.'  \n \nIf you do tahlil and tahmid as well that is good. If you want \nto do that you say,  \n \n'Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar la ilaha ill’Allah wa’Allahu \nAkbar Allahu Akbar wa lillahi'l-hamd.'  \n \nThis has been related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Both the first formula and the fuller version are \nequally acceptable.  \n \nThere are two descriptions of it. One is: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu \nAkbar, Allahu Akbar,' and the second is recommended and given. \nIf you wish, you can combine them. This is related from Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) via Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrecommended it. The first is also related from 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) and Qadi „Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated that it is well-\nknown. Both are permitted because it is not established that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) specified either of these two. \nWhen the command to do dhikr when leaving for the „Id prayer \nwas mentioned, what is meant by is the dhikr commanded in the \nwords of the Almighty: \"Mention Allah's name on particular days,\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 22:28) and His words, \"Remember Allah on the \ndesignated days\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:203) is appropriate to mention on \nthese days.  \n \n17.5c \"Particular days\"  \n \nThe 'particular days' [These are mentioned in the Holy \nQur'an.] are the three days of sacrifice. The designated \ndays' are the days of Mina, namely the three days after the \n‘Id \n  \nThe designated are for the stoning mentioned in the ayat. They \nare the second and third days of the Day of Sacrifice. The first of \nthe day of sacrifice is particular and not designated. The fourth is \ndesignated and not particular. The two middle days are both \nparticular and designated.  \n \n17.6 Preparing for the prayer  \n \n17.6a A ghusl  \n \nIt is good to do ghusl for both the ‘Ids but it is not \nnecessary \n  \nIt is recommended to have a ghusl, in the same form as the ghusl \nfor janaba. It is asked of every one with discrimination, even if not \nlegally responsible nor intending to go to the prayer. It is not \nnecessary as sunnah. The best time is after the Subh prayer. It is \nenough if he washes before Fajr.  \n \n17.6b Perfume and best clothes  \n \nand it is recommended to use perfume and to wear your \nbest clothes \n  \nPerfume is recommended for men whether or not they go to the \nprayer. If women go to the prayer, it is not permitted for them to \nuse perfume, and there is no difference between old woman and \nothers. There is no harm if they do not go out. It is recommended \nfor men to wear their best clothes, which means new, even if they \nare black. All the evidence for that is in the sunnah. In the hadith \nof Ibn 'Abbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \"The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) used to bathe on the Day of Fitr and Adha and put on \nperfume and encouraged that, and he ordered us when we went to \nthe place of prayer to wear the best clothes we had.\"  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Eighteen: On the eclipse prayer \n \n \nClarification of its general description in the solar and lunar \neclipses. The terms kusuf and khusuf are synonyms and both used \nfor the sun and moon. It is said that there is a difference between \nthem: kusuf is when the light changes and khusuf is when the \nlight goes entirely. The moon loses all its light, but the sun is not \nlike that, and so khusuf is used of the moon and kusuf of the sun. \nTheir evidence is in the sunnah where the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"The sun and moon are not eclipsed for the \ndeath or life of anyone. When you see that, remember Allah azza \nwa jall.\" One variant has, \"then pray.\" The eclipse prayer is \nSunnah.  \n \n18.1The Solar Eclipse  \n \n18.1a Its judgment  \n \nThe eclipse prayer is an obligatory sunnah whenever there \nis an eclipse of the sun \n  \nIt is agreed that the Solar Eclipse prayer is a confirmed Sunnah. \nThere is disagreement about the lunar eclipse. The two famous \npositions are that the lunar eclipse prayer is recommended as \nShaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated. The solar eclipse \nprayer is done in a group or singly. It is better in a group.  \n \n18.1b How it is done: first recitation  \n \nThe Imam goes to the masjid and begins to lead the people \nin prayer without either an adhan or an iqama. He recites \nsilently a very long piece of the Holy Qur'an such as Surat \nal-Baqara. Then he goes into ruku' for the same amount of \ntime. Then he stands upright again saying Sami ’Allahu \nliman hamidah'  \n \nWhen the sun is eclipsed, wholly or partly, the Imam goes to the \nmasjid, and when he arrives, he leads the people in prayer. There \nis no precondition of number in it, like Jumu'a. There is no adhan \nor iqama or statement, \"The prayer is gathered\" based on what is \ntransmitted of the action of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). He says the takbir to begin as in all prayers. Then he \nbegins to recite silently the Fatiha and then a long bit of the Holy \nQur'an because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. \nIt is defined as being like Surat al-Baqara. The School is that it is \nrecommended to recite al-Baqara in the first standing of the first \nrak'at after the Fatiha. Opposite is the School that \"like\" indicates \nthat it is desirable and this sura is not particular. What it is \nmeant is the length. Then he does ruku' for the same length of \ntime, and then comes up. The Imam says \"Allah hears whoever \npraises Him\" and the follower says \"Our Lord, and praise is \nYours.\"  \n \n18.1c How it is done: second recitation  \n \nThen he recites another piece of the Holy Qur'an slightly \nshorter than the first. Then he goes into ruku' again for the \nsame amount of time as he spent reciting. Then he once \nmore stands upright saying, 'Sami Allahu liman hamidah'  \n \nThen, in the well-known position, he recites the Fatiha, which \ndiffers from Shaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi alaihi) who says \nthat he does not recite. The reason for that is that it is two rak'ats \nand the Fatiha is not repeated twice in the same rak'at. He recites \nless than he did in the first standing. It is recommended that it be \nal-'Imran. In his second ruku' he says the tashbih and does not \nrecite or make supplication.  \n \n18.1d How it is done: two sajdas \n  \nThen he does two full sajdas \n  \nHe does them with tranquillity. There are two positions about \nwhether they are long like the ruku'. The most well-known is the \nfirst. The second is in the Mukhtasar of Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). It seems probable.  \n \n18.1e How it is done: second rak'at  \n \nAfter this he stands up again and recites another piece of \nthe Holy Qur'an slightly shorter than the previous one and \nthen goes into ruku' for the same length of time. Then as \nbefore he stands upright again and recites one more \nslightly shorter piece of the Holy Qur'an which is followed \nby ruku' for the same amount of time as the recitation. He \nstands back upright again and then does two sajdas as \nbefore \n  \nHe recites the Fatiha and then a shorter piece, and it is \nrecommended that it be Surat an-Nisa'. Then after the third \nstanding, he goes into ruku' in which he glorifies and does not \nrecite or make supplication. Then he comes up and then recites \nthe Fatiha in the well-known position and then a shorter sura \nthan the third, and it is recommended that it be Surat al-Ma‟ida.  \n \n18.1f How it is done: tashahhud  \n \nFinally he says the tashahhud and then the salam \n  \nThis is the description which the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentioned. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is our \nSchool and the school of the majority. Its evidence are sound \nexplicit hadiths on this previous manner which our author \ndescribed. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he \nprays two rak'ats like other nafila prayers.  \n \n18.1g Can be done at home  \n \nIf you like the prayer can be done in this way in your own \nhouse \n  \nThe eclipse prayer can be done at home when that does not lead to \nabandoning it in the group. If doing that leading to not doing in \nthe group, then it is disliked to pray it at home. He then goes on to \nthe lunar eclipse.  \n \n18.2 The Lunar Eclipse  \n \n18.2a No group prayer  \n \nIf there is an eclipse of the moon there is no group prayer \n  \nThis is in the well-known position. It is transmitted from Shaikh \nal-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the prohibition is one of the \nnature of the haram. As for the group, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) forbid it \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did not gather a \ngroup for the lunar eclipse. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) allow it.  \n \n18.2b How it is done  \n \nWhen it happens people should pray individually, reciting \nout loud as for any other nafila prayer at night \n  \nPeople pray in their own in their houses in the well-known \nposition of the School. An opposite position is found in the report \nthat in al-Majmu'a that Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat they pray individually in the masjid. Recitation is out loud as \nfor other nafila, since it might be imagined that people pray in the \nform of the nafila without specific intention. It is possible that it \nhas the form of the solar eclipse. We read in at-Tahqiq, \"The \napparent meaning of the words of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) is that it does not need a specific intention like other \nnafilas as opposed to the solar eclipse which needs a particular \nintention. What is desired is obtained by two rak'ats only although \nit is desirable to pray groups of two rak'ats until it is finished. It's \ntime is the entire night. Its is not done when dawn comes.  \n \n18.3 The khutba after the prayer for the solar eclipse  \n \n18.3a No formal khutba  \n \nThere is no formal khutba after the prayer for the eclipse \nof the sun \n  \nThere is no khutba before or after the eclipse prayer because a \ngroup of the Companions transmitted the description of the \nEclipse prayer and none of them mentioned that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) gave a khutba in it. As for what is related \nfrom 'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) prayed the eclipse prayer and then went and \naddressed the people and praised and lauded Allah azza wa jall, it \nmeans that he spoke some words which contained the praise of \nAllah azza wa jall and the prayer on the Prophets (may Allah azza \nwa jall bless them all) and admonition as would be found in a \nkhutba.  \n \n18.3b Informal admonition  \n \nbut there is no harm in the Imam taking the opportunity to \nadmonish and remind people \n  \nHe reminds people about the calamities which happen in this \nworld because of disobeying Allah azza wa jall. It differs from \nwhat is before it because the khutba has no meaning except this. \nIt is not the particular form of the khutba. The Mukhtasar says \nthat reminding is only recommended.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Nineteen: On the Rain Prayer \n \n \nClarification of the time when it is done, which is in the early \nmorning until the sun declines. He clarifies the place where it is \ndone, which is the desert. Its name, istisqa' linguistically means to \nask for drink and in the Shari‟ah it is to ask Allah azza wa jall for \nwater because of drought which has occurred.  \n \n19.1 Its judgment  \n \nThe rain prayer is a sunnah which is acted upon \n  \nThe Rain prayer is a sunnah which it is confirmed should be \nprayed, and is not abandoned. This differs from Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) who says it is not prescribed. The evidence \nfor its being prescribed is what is in the two Sahih collections: that \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) went out to the place of \nprayer and prayed for rain from Allah azza wa jall. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) faced the qibla and reversed his cloak and prayed \ntwo rak'ats in which the recitation was out loud. There is no \ndisagreement that the supplication is after changing the cloak and \nafter facing the qibla and after the prayer.  \n \n19.2 Who performs it  \n \nThe Imam goes out for the prayer  \n \nOne variant has the \"Imam and the people\". It appears to be \ngeneral, but that it not the case. They are divided into those who \ngo out for it and those who do not go out for into three groups. One \ngroup go out to it by agreement: they are the legally responsible \nMuslims, even if they are slaves or women who normally go out \nand children with understanding. One group do not go out for it by \nagreement: young women and menstruating women. There is a \ngroup about whom there is disagreement: they are the children \nwho do not understand, young women who are not tempting and \nthe people of the dhimma. The well-known position for other than \nthe people of the dhimma is that they do not go out. The well-\nknown position for the people of the dhimma is that they go out \nwith the people, not before or after them. They do not mix with the \npeople, but are to one side.  \n \nIt is recommended that the Imam command the people to repent \nand avoid injustices. That is before they go to the place of prayer \nbecause sins are a cause for misfortunes. Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Whatever strikes you of an affliction is by what your hands \nearned.\" (Holy Qur‟an 42:30) The reason for denying the answer, \nas has come in hadith was made clear by Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) when he says, \"The dusty disheveled slave \nstretches out his hands to the heaven, 'O Lord, O Lord' while his \nfood is haram, his clothing is haram and he is nourished by the \nharam, so how can he be answered like that?\" He commanded \nthem to give sadaqa and charity. It is recommended to fast thee \ndays before the rain prayer and they go out in ragged clothes and \nhumility with tranquillity and gravity. The well-known position is \nthat the Imam says the takbir when they go out to it.  \n \n19.3 Its time  \n \nin the early morning as for the ‘Id prayers \n  \nIt is probable that the resemblance is in the prayer-place, i.e. the \nImam goes out to the prayer place as he goes out for the „Id, for \nother than the people of Makka. They pray for rain in the Masjid \nal-Haram as they pray in it. Then he says, \"morning\" to clarify the \ntime of going out.  \n \n19.4 How it is done  \n \n19.4a Two rak'ats  \n \nHe leads the people in two rak’ats  \n \nWhen the Imam reaches the prayer-place, he leads the people in \nonly two rak'ats by agreement of those who say that it is \nprescribed. It is permitted to do nafila before and after it. Shaikh \nibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted that that it disliked \nfrom Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) by analogy with the \n„Id prayer. The one who says that it is permitted distinguishes the \nrain prayer as being intended to seek nearness by good actions to \nremove punishment, which is not like the „Id prayer.  \n \n19.4b Recitation  \n \nin which the recitation is out loud. He recites Surat al-A'la \nin the first rak’at and Surat ash-Shams in the second. He \ndoes two sajdas and one ruku' in each rak’at and finishes \nwith the tashahhud and the salam \n  \nIt is agreed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) recited \nout loud in them. In the first rak'at he recites the Fatiha and Al-\nA'la (Holy Qur‟an 87) in it, and the like of that in the second with \nthe Fatiha and ash-Shams (Holy Qur‟an 91). These two suras are \nmentioned because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nrecited them in it. There are two prostration‟s in each rak'at. \nThere is one ruku' is avoid being like the eclipse prayer. When he \nfinishes the final prostration, he does the tashahhud and salam.  \n \n19.5 The khutba  \n \nHe then turns and faces the people. When everyone is quiet \nhe stands and, leaning on a bow-shaft or staff, gives two \nkhutbahs sitting down between them \n  \nIt is desirable while he is sitting on the earth. He does not ascend \na minbar because this situation demands humility. When they are \nstill in their places, it is recommended that he stand and begin to \nspeak. The two khutbahs in the Rain Prayer resembles that on the \ntwo „Ids in that they are after the prayer and he sits in them at \nthe beginning and second. That is what the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did.  \n \n19.6 Changing the cloak  \n \nWhen he finishes he faces the qibla and then turns his \ncloak inside out, putting what was on his right shoulder on \nhis left shoulder and vice versa. He does not turn it upside \ndown. Everyone else does the same except that he is \nstanding and they remain seated \n  \nWhen he finishes the khutba, he faces the qibla where he is and \nchanges his cloak, for luck, to indicate the change of their state \nfrom hardship to ease. This is what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did. He does not turn his cloak upside down. Shaikh \nSanad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that because that is not recorded \nfrom him nor from anyone after him. The description of turning is \nto put the lower edge on the top and the top on the bottom, based \non what is in that of bad luck in respect for His words, \"We turned \nthe place completely upside down.\" (Holy Qur‟an 15:74) As for \nchanging what is on the right to the left, it is only possible by \nturning it inside out. Then the men but not the women do the like \nof that of the Imam, if they have cloaks and change their cloaks \nwhile seated. The Imam changes it while standing.  \n \n19.7 Supplication  \n \nThen, while like this, the Imam makes du'a after which he \nand everyone else leave \n  \nThis is done while he is standing facing qibla. It is done out loud \nand the supplication is of medium length, neither long nor short. \nPart of the Holy Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) supplication \nwas, \"O Allah, give water to Your slaves and animals and spread \nyour mercy and give life to your dead land.\" It is recommended for \nthe one who is near to the Imam to say \"Amin\" after his \nsupplication and to raise his hands with the palms towards the \nearth, looking at the sky. Then according to the well-known \nposition they leave. It is said that he returns facing the people, \nreminding them and supplicating, and they say Amin to his \nsupplication and then go.  \n \n19.7a No takbirs  \n \nThere are no special takbirs in this prayer or in the eclipse \nprayer. There is just the takbir al-ihram and the normal \ntakbirs for going into ruku' and for going into sujud and \ncoming back out of it. There is no adhan or iqama for the \nrain prayer \n  \nThere is no takbir in the khutba. Takbir is replaced with asking \nforgiveness. He says, \"I ask the forgiveness of Allah the Immense. \nThere is no god but Him, the Living, the Self-Subsistent, and I \nturn to Him.\" In the two khutbahs, he often says, \"Ask for the \nforgiveness of Your Lord. He is Forgiving and will send the rain on \nyou in torrents, support you with wealth and sons, appoint \ngardens for you, and make rivers flow for you.\"  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty \nOn what to do when someone is at the point of \ndeath and on washing the dead, shrouding \nthem, embalming them, carrying them and \nburying them \n \n \n20.1 Attendance at death  \n \n20.1a Turning the person towards qibla  \n \nWhen someone is at the point of death, it is recommended \nto turn them so that they face qibla and to close their eyes \nafter they have died \n  \nWhen the signs of death appear in a person and it is certain that \nhe will die, he is turned: that is when the eyes become fixed. It is \ndisliked to do that before. What is meant by facing qibla is to put \nhim on his right side with his chest towards the qibla. It is said \nthat that at that point one says, \"In the name of Allah and on the \nSunnah of the Rasulullah and peace be upon the Messengers and \npraise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Let those who \nwork, work for the like of this (i.e. death) The like of this is not \ndenied.\" It is also recommended to tie the jaw with a bandage, \nbind the limbs gently, lift him from the earth, cover him with a \ncloth, place something heavy on his abdomen like a sword, and to \nrecount the shahadah to him.  \n \n20.1b Saying the shahadah  \n \nThe shahadah should be said in the presence of the dying \nperson so they will be reminded of it \n  \nThis is done before he actually dies. The previous things are for \nthe person who has died. This instruction is that someone sitting \nwith him says so that he can hear, \"La ilaha ill‟Allah. \nMuhammadun Rasulullah.\" This is done when the signs of death \nappear. He is taught so that he will remember them in his mind \nand die acknowledging them in his consciousness. When the dying \nperson says them, they are not repeated to him unless he is \nspeaking a foreign language and then they are repeated to him so \nthat that will be the last of his words and he will enter the Garden \nby what is related: \"If the last words of a person are 'la ilaha \nill‟Allah,' he will enter the Garden.\" One does not say, \"Say: 'la \nilaha ill‟Allah' because he might be in a conflict with Shaitan who \nsays, 'Die on the din of the Jews or Christians,' and he says 'No,' \nand then people will have a bad opinion of him.]  \n \n20.1c Purity of the body  \n \nIt is better that the body and what it is on are free of \nimpurity. It is better that menstruating women or anyone \nin a state of janaba do not come near someone who is dying \n  \nIt is desirable that what is on and under the body and the body \nitself be pure, if that is possible. The reason is that the angels will \nbe present with him. It is recommended that menstruating women \nor those in janaba do not come near the dying person because the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said that the angels do not \nenter a house in which there is a menstruating woman or someone \nin janaba. It is desirable that no dogs or images or anything that \nangels dislike be brought near him.  \n \n20.1d Reading Sura Yasin  \n \nSome of the 'ulama' recommend reading Surat Yasin at the \nbedside of the dying person although according to Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) this was not the usual practice \n  \n'Some' means Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is read at \nhis head or feet or elsewhere. Surat Yasin is read because it is \nrelated that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There \nis no one who dies who has Surat Yasin read at his head but that \nAllah makes it easy for him.\" This recitation is not mentioned by \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). He considers it disliked, and \nthat Surat Yasin is not singled out. He considers it disliked to \nrecite Surat Yasin or any other sura when a person is dying, after \nhis death or at his grave. It is also disliked to instruct him after he \nhas been placed in the grave.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is disliked to recite the \nHoly Qur'an beside a dying person and to recite it beside the dead \nperson or at his burial. It is also disliked to burn aromatic \nsubstances.  \n \n20.1e Weeping  \n \nThere is no harm in weeping when someone dies although \nself-control and patient endurance are better if that is \npossible \n  \nThere is no harm in weeping when the person is dying or after his \ndeath. Self-control in what has happened is good and better if \npossible. He is helped in that by looking at the reward for \nafflictions in ayats and hadiths which are related about that. One \nis them is the words of the Almighty, \"But give good news to the \nsteadfast: those who, when disaster strikes them, say, 'We belong \nto Allah and will return to Him.' Those are the ones who will have \nblessings and mercy from their Lord.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:155-156) \nThe blessings and mercy of Allah azza wa jall are not equal to any \nof the things connected to this world. In hadith: \"Whoever says \nthat and says with it, 'O Allah, reward me for my loss and replace \nit with better than it,' Allah will do that for him.\"  \n \n20.1f Wailing is forbidden  \n \nand crying out and wailing are forbidden \n  \nBased on the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \n\"The one beats his cheek and tears his garments and calls out \nwith the call of the Jahiliyya is not one of us.\" In a variant of \nMuslim, \"When the wailer does not repent before she dies, she will \nbe raised up on the Day of Rising with trousers of pitch and a shirt \nof mange.  \n \n20.2 Washing the body  \n \n20.2a Number of times  \n \nThere is no fixed limit to the number of times you wash a \ndead body. The body should be thoroughly cleaned and the \nnumber of times it is washed should be odd \n  \nExcept for the martyr in battle according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), but what is desired is that the body be clear \nand that it be washed an odd number of times. The reply is that \nthe limit is that which should not be exceeded or decreased, and \nthe odd is three, five or seven. In short, the cleaning defined by \nthe number three does not have the limitation of a particular \nnumber since it is known that the odd contains three, five, etc. It \nis recommended that the washing be odd except not only one time, \nwhich is not desirable. The principle of the Sunnah washing is \nbased on what is well-known and it does not need an intention. It \nis also said that it is obligatory and confirmed, i.e. on society as a \nwhole, which is preferred, and it is done as an act of worship, not \nfor cleanness in the well-known position. It is said that it is for \ncleanness. It is clear that the result of the dispute is that when a \nMuslim man dies, and there is no Muslim with him but there is a \nDhimmi with him, according to the statement that it is worship, \nthe Dhimmi does not wash him because he is not one of the people \nof worship. According to the second one, that it is for cleanness, \nthe Dhimmi washes him.  \n \n20.2b What is used for washing  \n \nIt should be washed with water and Sidr (Lote tree leaves) \nand in the last washing camphor should be added to the \nwater \n  \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it means that \nall of the scholars say that crushed Lote leaves should be dissolved \nin water and then the body of the corpse rubbed with it. It is like \nthat in every washing except the first. In it there must be clear \nwater for the obligatory ghusl. In the last washing it is \nrecommended to add camphor because the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) commanded that if there is no camphor, then \nanother perfume takes its place. When there is no Lote, then \nsaltwort and the like is used instead.  \n \n20.2c Covering the private parts  \n \nDuring the washing the body's private parts should be kept \ncovered \n  \nWhen the dead person is stripped to be washed, the private parts \nshould be covered. What Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nunderstands from the Mudawwana are the actual private parts in \nparticular. The accepted position is that it is what is between the \nwaist and the knees, as is transmitted from Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ntransmitted from Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the \nchest and face are covered, fearing change which could give rise to \nbad opinion.  \n \n20.2d Cutting nails and hair \n \nThe nails should not be cut nor should the hair be shaved \noff \n  \nIf it is done, it is disliked to do this and they are included with him \nin his shroud.  \n \n20.2e Squeezing the stomach  \n \nThe stomach should be gently squeezed \n  \nIt is recommended to do this before washing if it is needed. It is \ndone gently lest any thing of it come out and soil the shroud.  \n \n20.2f Wudu'  \n \nIt is good if wudu' is done for the dead person although \nthis is not obligatory \n \nIt is recommended and does not require an intention because he is \ndoing it for someone else. It is not obligatory, which indicates that \nthere are two positions in the question. It indicated the first when \nhe says it is good, and he rejected the second by saying that it is \nnot obligatory, even if something impure issues from him after \nwashing. It is removed and he is not washed again nor is wudu' \ndone for him. Only the place is washed.  \n \n20.2g Position of the corpse  \n \nIt is better if the body is turned on its side for washing \nalthough it is acceptable to wash it in a sitting position \n  \nIt is better than sitting it up because it is easier to clean and \nkinder to the corpse. He first puts him on his left side and then \nwashes the right side, and then turns him on the right side and \nwashes the left side. This is recommended although sitting is \nallowed. Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers it \nbecause he more able to wash thoroughly.  \n \n20.2h It is good for a spouse to wash  \n \nIt is good for a husband or wife to wash their dead partner \nalthough it does not necessarily have to be them that do it \n  \nThere is no harm here if another is chosen. Either of the couple \nhas priority in the washing of the one who has died over other \nrelatives so that he is adjudged to be able to do it if the relatives \ndispute about it. The basis for it is what is mentioned about 'Ali \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) washing Fatima (radhi‟Allahu anha) and Abu \nBakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) being washed by his wife.  \n \n20.2i Who washes a woman without relatives or other \nwomen  \n \nIf a woman dies on a journey and there are no other \nwomen present nor any men of mahram status then a man \nshould do tayammum for her, wiping her face and hands \n  \nIf a Muslim woman dies and there are no Muslim women or male \nrelatives present, but there are unrelated men, a man does \ntayammum for her, wiping the hands only to the wrists because \nthey are not part of 'awra and so it is permitted to look at them \nwithout lust. Shaikh az-Zurqani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It is \npermitted for a unrelated man to wipe her when she is lifeless \nbecause of the rarity of pleasure here. The one who prays only \ndoes tayammum after finishing the tayammum of the corpse \nbecause it is the time of the prayer.\"  \n \n20.2j Who washes such a man  \n \nSimilarly if the dead person is a man and there are no \nother men present nor a woman of mahram status, then a \nwoman should do tayammum for him, wiping his face and \nhis hands and arms to the elbows. If there is a woman of \nmahram status present she should wash his body, keeping \nhis 'awra covered \n  \nWhen there is a woman who is a relative present, she washes him, \ncovering the 'awra according to one of two interpretations in the \nMudawwana. It is sound because his body is not forbidden for \nthem to see. So it is permitted for her to look at a male relative \nexcept for what is between the waist and knees. Touching is \nanalogous with looking by necessity. The other interpretation is \nthat his entire body is veiled.  \n \n20.2k When a woman's mahram is present  \n \nIf a woman has died and there is a man of mahram status \npresent he should wash her through a cloth covering her \nwhole body \n  \nWhen there is no woman with her, a relative or in-law washes her \naccording to what is in the Mudawwana. Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he does not wash her, but performs \ntayammum. The form of washing is that water is poured on her \nand he does not touch her body with his hand either above or \nunder the cloth.  \n \n20.3 Shrouding  \n \n20.3a Number  \n \nIt is recommended for the body to be shrouded in an odd \nnumber of lengths of cloth, either three, five or seven. Any \nwaist-wrapper, shirt or turban that is put on the body is \ncounted as one piece of cloth. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) was shrouded in three lengths of white sahuli \ncloth, each layer being well wrapped round him. \n  \nThis is with the exception of the martyr in battle. He is silent \nabout what is obligatory, which is a garment which covers the \nentire body. It is clear from his words that seven is recommended \nfor both men and women. It is in al-Mukhtasar and it is what is \naccepted. Seven is recommended especially for woman, and more \nthan five for a man is disliked. Since he feared that that would be \nlimited to what is used to wrap the body, he removed the possible \nmisconception by saying that that includes garments. Then he \nindicates the recommendation of the odd number based on the \nHoly Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) example. \"Sahuli\" refers to \na type of cotton which is washed or it refers to a town in Yemen.  \n \n20.3b Just a shirt and turban  \n \nThere is no harm in a dead man being dressed in a shirt \nand a turban \n  \nNo harm here means it is better to do it. There is a text in the \nMukhtasar that it is recommended, i.e. each of them is \nrecommended, not that it is one recommendation. The turban is \nrecommended for a man, and one leaves the end of it an arm's \nlength to put over his face. A woman has no turban. A head \ncovering is put on her head and the end of it left to put on her face. \nThe best shroud is white cotton or linen. But cotton is better \nbecause it is more concealing and because the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) was shrouded in it. It is disliked to use yellow or \ngreen scent and every color except white. The place of dislike is \nwhen it is possible to have white. Otherwise it is not. Shrouding, \nthe perfume and preparing it is advanced before the debt - except \nfor the pawn and bequest. However, if there is a pledge against \nthe debt, it is permitted to the pledgee. The pledged debt is \nadvanced over the cost of preparation.  \n \n20.3c Use of perfume  \n \nThe body should be perfumed, with the perfume being put \nbetween the layers of cloth that make up the shroud and \nalso directly on the body and the places which touch the \nground in sujud \n  \nIt is recommended to perfume the corpse with perfume, which is \nnot forbidden and is customary. It is recommended to dry the body \nwith a clean rag before it is perfumed, and it is recommended that \nits clothes be fumigated an odd number of times, three, five, or \nseven and the like. Hanut, which is perfume like musk, amber or \ncamphor is put between the shrouds, i.e. on each layer except the \ntop, and on the body, like the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and nostrils \nby spreading it on cotton and putting it on his eyes, ears, nose and \norifices without putting it in, and also on the places of prostration: \nbrow, neck, knees, hands and toes of the feet.  \n \n20.4 Martyrs, suicides and executed criminals  \n \n20.4a Martyrs  \n \nA shahid on the battlefield is not washed nor is the prayer \ndone for him, he is buried in his clothes \n  \nA martyr is anyone who dies by weapons in battle against the \nunbelievers when there is a battle. Similar to being killed by \nactual weapons is dying because of being trampled by a horse, \nfalling from a camel, or attacking the enemy and falling into a \nwell or falling from a precipice. The apparent meaning of his \nwords is that he is not prayed over if he is killed by the enemy in \nthe land of Islam. That is the well-known position. Opposite it is \nthat he says if he is in the land of Islam, he is washed and prayed \nover because his degree is less than that of the martyr who has \nentered enemy territory. If he is carried live from the battle and \nthen dies, the well-known position is that he washed and prayed \nover, even if the fighter is wounded when he is removed, unless he \nis on the point of death and does not eat or drink. This is the \nsummary of the words of some of the commentaries of Shaikh \nKhalil (rahmatullahi alaihi). But the School is that the one who is \nwounded is not washed whether he is removed unconscious or not, \nexcept the one who has fainted.  \n \nAs he is not washed or prayed over, he is buried in his clothes with \nleather socks and a cap and a belt of little value and it is \npermitted, or a ring of little value. But not the armor and \nweapons: they are taken from him. He does not have anything \nelse. If his clothes are not enough to cover him, they are increased \nso that he is will covered as obligatory. Similarly it is obligatory to \nshroud him when he is found naked. The martyr is not washed by \nthe words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"Wrap them \nin their garments. The color is the color of blood and the scent is \nthe scent of musk,\" meaning that with Allah azza wa jall the smell \nof blood is pleasing like the smell of musk. For that reason, he is \nnot washed and the blood is not removed from him. He is not \nprayed over by what was said to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \"Do you convey that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) prayed over Hamza (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and said 50 \ntakbirs?\" He replied, \"No, and he (alaihi salat wa salam) did not \npray over any of the martyrs.\" It was in the Muwatta' that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) led the people in prayer over \nhim as individuals and did not lead anyone in the prayer. Qadi \n„Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said the sound position which the \nmajority hold is that the prayer of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) was a real prayer, not only supplication. It is said that \nwhat is meant by the prayer over him is supplication only. Shaikh \nal-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said its reason is that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) was better than every martyr \nwhose excellence dispenses with the prayer over him. The martyr \ncannot be washed since that would remove the blood which must \nremain because of its goodness and because it is a token of his \nmartyrdom in the Next World.  \n \n20.4b Suicides  \n \nIf someone kills himself, the prayer is done for him \n  \nThis is whether it is suicide or an accident. His wrong action is \nhis. The people of virtue pray over him when it is accidental, but \nnot when it is deliberate.   \n \n20.4c Those who have been executed  \n \nThe prayer is also done for someone killed by the Imam as \na hadd punishment or because they have killed someone. \nThe Imam himself does not participate in the prayer \n  \nWhen someone has been killed by obligation, as for abandoning \nthe prayer on account laziness and the highwayman, and those \nwho have to be stoned for sodomy or adultery, or whom the Imam \nhas killed for a hadd or in retaliation, neither the Imam nor the \npeople of virtue pray over him. The Imam and the people of virtue \ndo not pray over him so that that will be a deterrent to others \nagainst doing the like of what he did when they see the Imams \nand people of virtue refuse to pray over him.  \n \n20.5 Bringing the dead to the grave  \n \n20.5a No incense and walking in front  \n \nIncense should not be burned during funeral processions \nand it is better to walk in front of the bier \n  \nIncense is not used because it involves fire and the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) forbade that. It is better for men to walk in \nfront than to walk behind. If they ride, it is recommended for them \nto go behind the bier. The evidence for the first is what is related \nby the people of the Sunan from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) who said, \"I saw the Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) walk in front of the bier.\" The evidence for the second is \nwhat Abu Dawud (radhi‟Allahu anhu) related that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The rider travels behind the \nfuneral.\"  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): It should not be too slow. \nWomen go at the very end. The bier should not be brought into the \nmasjid.  \n \n20.5b The body is placed on its right side  \n \nThe body should be placed in the grave on its right side \n  \nIt is recommended that the corpse be placed on its right side \nfacing qibla because it is the noblest of positions. The right hand is \nextended over his body and the head put level with earth. Earth is \nput behind and in front of it so that it does not move. The binding \nof the shroud is undone. If he cannot be put on his right side, then \nhe is put on his back with his face towards qibla. If that is not \npossible, then however is possible, If his direction shifts in the \nburial, as when it is put not to qibla or on the left side and not too \nlong has passed, that is remedied and he is moved. A long time \nmeans when the burial is complete.  \n \n20.5c Clay and straw placed over the corpse  \n \nand slabs made of clay and straw should be laid over it \n  \nAfter the dead person is placed in the grave, then bricks are put \nover him. That is based on the transmission that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) made the grave of his son Ibrahim \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and put bricks on the grave. It is \nrecommended to plug the gaps since he (alaihi salat wa salam) \ncommanded that about his son.  \n \n20.5d What is said  \n \nWhen this is done you should say, \"O Allah, our companion \nis now with You. He has left this world behind him and is \nin need of what is with You. O Allah, make his speech firm \nwhen he is questioned and do not test him in his grave \nbeyond what he can bear. Grant that he may be in the \ncompany of the Holy Prophet, Muhammad (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \n  \nWhen the corpse is in the grave or those present have buried him, \nand the bricks are in place then this is said.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that those who are next \nto the grave throw in handfuls of earth \n  \n20.6 Monuments  \n \nIt is disliked to build anything on graves or to whitewash \nthem \n  \nIt appears that this is absolute, but that is not the case. There are \ndetails about this. In short, what is disliked is when it is in \nwasteland or owed so that the people of corruption cannot resort \nto it nor is pride intended by it and so distinction is intended by it. \nIt is also unlawful in waqf land absolutely, like al-Qarafa. He said \nin at-Tahqiq, \"It is obligatory for the governor to command that it \nbe demolished.\" Whitewashing is also disliked because it is found \nin Sahih Muslim that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade that the grave be whitewashed and that it be built on or \nsat on.   \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): the tumulus should not be \nraised more than one hand above the trench and should be shaped \nlike a camel's back although some dislike this and say it should be \nflat. There should be no fence around the grave. A tombstone is \npermitted as a market or a piece of wood, but this must not have \nany writing with the name, date or death, qualities of the person, \netc.  \n \n20.7 Burying an unbelieving father  \n \nA Muslim should not wash his father if he is not a Muslim \nnor should he put him in his grave unless he is afraid that \nhis body will remain unburied in which case he should \ncover the body and then bury it \n  \nBecause washing is only done for the one over whom the prayer is \nsaid. An unbeliever is not prayed over and so there is no point in \nwashing him. The prohibition is one of forbidding, and applies \neven more so to others than his father. Nor does he put him in his \ngrave because his filial duty is removed with the death of his \nfather. This is unless he fears that he will be left unburied. Then \nit is a duty to bury the body, and there is no difference between a \nunbeliever with whom we are at war and others. This does not \nonly apply to the father, but the obligation is general, extending \neven to the stranger. He is not made to face qibla because he is not \none of its people.  \n \n20.8 Niche in the grave  \n \nAccording to the people of knowledge the lahd-type (niche) \ngrave is better than the Shaqq-type (a simple trench). A \nlahd-type grave is one in which, after you have dug the \nbasic trench, you dig out a place for the body at the bottom \nof the side which faces qibla so that the body is protected \nby an overhang. This should be done provided that the \nearth is firm enough and will not crumble or cave in. This \nwas how the grave of the Holy Prophet  (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) was dug. \n  \nThis is based on the tradition, \"The lahd is for us and the Shaqq \nfor others\" and because Allah azza wa jall chose it for His Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). If the ground is too soft or sandy, then the \nShaqq is better.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): Graves should not be too \ndeep, not more than a cubit.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-One: On the Funeral Prayer \nand the Supplication for the Dead \n \n \nShaikh ibn 'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the position of \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that janaza is the bier and \njanaza is the dead person. Shaikh ibn al-Asma'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said the opposite. Shaikh al-Farra' (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that they mean the same. Shaikh ibn Qutayba (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said janaza is the corpse. Shaikh al-A'rabi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that janaza is the bier. It is derived from janaza, when \nsomething becomes heavy, or from covering something and so it is \nappropriate.  \n \nThe chapter also clarifies the judgment of the prayer on the dead \nperson which is fard kifayah. He can be prayed over at any time, \nday or night, except sunrise and sunset: it is forbidden at those \ntimes. It is disliked in the disliked time. In the first case it is \nrepeated as long as he has not been buried. It is not repeated in \nthe second at all. The place of that is when change is not feared for \nhim. Otherwise the prayer is permitted without dispute.  \n \nEvery dead Muslim is prayed for who was not a martyr in battle. \nThere is no prayer over someone who has already been prayed \nover already. The prayer over him is led by the one he commanded \nto do it. Such a person is preferred to the local authority if he is \nknown to be good and the blessing of his supplication is hoped for \nunless it is know that there was enmity between him and the \ndeceased. Then it is not permitted to designate him.  \n \n21.1 The Pillars of the Funeral Prayer  \n \nThe pillars of the janaza prayer are five:  \n \nStanding. If they pray sitting, it is not allowed except on account \nof a valid excuse (like illness). This is according to the position \nthat it is obligatory. The evidence for the obligation is understood \nfrom His words, \"Do not ever pray over any of them who die\" (Holy \nQur‟an 9:84) based on the understanding which is opposite the \njudgment of what is said: it is that the obligation of praying over \nthe believers is not contrary to the judgment articulated, which is \nlack of respect of the prayer over the believers.  \n \nThe ihram, i.e. the intention  \n \nThe salam.  \n \nSupplication.  \n \nThe takbirs.  \n \n21.2 How to do the prayer  \n \n21.2a Four takbirs  \n \nThe janaza (funeral) prayer contains four takbirs \n  \nSince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. That is \nsince it was confirmed that in the last prayer that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed, he said four takbirs. If he \nsays the salam after three out of forgetfulness and then \nremembers soon after, he returns with only the intention, and he \ndoes not say that takbir since that would increase the number. He \nsays that the takbir and count it as one of the four. Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. If the Imam does \nan extra fifth, the followers says the salam and do not wait for \nhim. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that. \nShaikh ibn Harun (rahmatullahi alaihi) opposed that, saying that \nwhen the Imam stands for the fifth out of forgetfulness, they wait \nfor him so that they say the salam with his salam. Shaikh al-\nMawwaq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he heard Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) say that if the Imam is one of those \nwho say the takbir five times, the followers stop after the fourth \nand do not follow him in the fifth. It is understood that if he is one \nof those who do not say five takbirs, but he says a fifth \ninadvertently, then the follower does not stop, but he remains \nstill. When the Imam says the salam, the follower says his salam. \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that in al-Wadiha as does \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n21.2b Lifting the hands for the first takbir  \n \nYou lift your hands for the first takbir and there is no \nharm in doing so for each of the others \n  \nThis is one of four statements and it is made by Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He said that he raises his hands in the first \nand can choose in the rest. If he wishes, he raises them. If he \nwishes, he does not raise them. The second position is that he \nraises them in every takbir. This is in the Mudawwana and \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred it. The third, \nwhich is also in the Mudawwana, is that he raises them only in \nthe first takbir, and raising them in the others is contrary to the \nfirst. Shaikh at-Tunisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred it. The \nfourth is that he only raises them in the first and not others. It is \nmore well-known than raising them in all.  \n \nIt was already stated that the supplication is one of the pillars of \nthe prayer, and so the prayer is repeated if it is omitted. There is \ndisagreement about the supplication after the fourth. Shaikh \nSahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) affirmed it by analogy with the rest \nof the takbirs. The rest of the people opposed him by making an \nanalogy with lack of recitation after the fourth rak'at because the \nfour takbirs take the place of the four rak'ats, i.e. the social form \nof the four takbirs with what they contain of supplication takes \nthe place of the four rak'ats, and as there is no recitation after the \nfourth rak'at, so there is no supplication after the fourth takbir. It \ndoes not mean that each takbir is in the position of a rak'at, which \nit observed alone or with the supplication. The probable meaning \nof the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that he can choose.  \n \n21.2c Supplication after the fourth rak'at  \n \nIf you like you can make a du'a after the fourth takbir \nbefore the salam or if you like, you can say the salam \ndirectly after the takbir \n  \n A third position.  \n \nNOTE: The Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not speak about the \nintention, which is one of the pillars. It is that he intends with his \nheart to pray over this deceased person while remembering that it \nis a fard kifayah. There is no harm that he neglects the final point. \nIt is valid as it is valid if he prays over him believing that it is \npraises and there is remembrance, and the reverse. That is also \nthe case if he thinks it is someone and then it becomes evident \nthat it is someone else because his intention was the person \npresent before him. This is not the case when there are two or \nmore on the bier and believes that there is only one. It is repeated \nby all since the one was not specific. Otherwise, it is repeated over \nthe one who was not specified whom he intended. If he intends one \nparticular one and then it becomes clear it is two or more, and the \none he named was not of them the one, then it is repeated over all. \nIf he intends the prayer on whoever is in bier while he believes it \nto be a group and then it is clear that it is one or two, it is sound \nbecause one or two are part of a group.  \n \n21.2d Where the Imam stands  \n \nThe Imam stands opposite the middle of the body if the \ndead person is a man and opposite the shoulders if it is a \nwoman \n  \nIt is recommended that the Imam stand here, and it is the same \nfor the one alone. These details are known in the Maliki School. \nShaikh ibn Sha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that for a man and \nwoman he stands wherever he likes.  \n \n21.2e The salam  \n \nThe salam for this prayer is said once quietly both by the \nImam and those following him \n  \nIn the well-known position. One position has 'quietly\" and so one \ncombines and says it quietly. This is for both the Imam and \nfollower. This differs from what is in the Mudawwana that the \nImam says the salam of the janaza so that the one next to him can \nhear it. The one following says the salam so that only he can hear. \nIf the one next to him hears it, there is no harm.  \n \n21.3 Reward for the prayer and attendance  \n \nThere is a great reward to be gained from doing the prayer \nand for being present at the burial. This reward is \nequivalent in size to Mount Uhud \n  \nThis is clarified in the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) in the Sahih, \"Whoever follows a janaza of a Muslim in \nbelief and expectation, and remains with it until he prays over it \nand leaves after it is buried returns with a reward of two qirats. \nEach qirat is like Uhud. Whoever prays over it and then returns \nbefore he is buried he returns with a qirat.\"  \n \n21.4 The first three supplications  \n \n21.4a No specific formula  \n \nThere is no specific formula for the du'a to be made when \ndoing the funeral prayer \n  \nThere is nothing specific because there are various supplications \nrelated from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and the \nCompanions in that. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand others relate the agreement that no specific supplication is \nrecommended. That is followed by the fact that in the Muwatta' \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) recommends the supplication of \nAbu Hurayra (radhi‟Allahu anhu) which is: \"O Allah, he is Your \nslave and the son of your slave and the son of your woman slave. \nHe used to testify that there is no god but You alone with no \npartner and that Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) is Your slave \nand Your Messenger and You know him best. O Allah, if he is \ngood, then increase his goodness. If he did evil, overlook his evil \nactions. O Allah, do not deny us his reward and not tempt us after, \nhim.\"  \n \n21.4b All are possible  \n \nAll the things which have come down are acceptable \n  \nAny supplication is permissible, so say what you like.  \n \n21.4c One excellent form  \n \nOne good thing to say after doing the takbir is: Praise be to \nAllah who makes death and brings to life and praise be to \nAllah who brings the dead to life. To Him belong \nGreatness, Sovereignty, Power, Exaltedness and He has \npower over all things. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the \nfamily of Muhammad as You blessed and were merciful to \nand poured goodness on Ibrahim and the family of \nIbrahim. In all the worlds, You are Praiseworthy, Glorious. \n  \nAllah, he is your slave and the son of Your slaves. You \ncreated him and provided for him. You made him die and \nYou will bring him to life and You know best about his \noutward and his inward. We have come to You as \nintercessors \non \nhis \nbehalf \nso \nplease \naccept \nour \nintercession. O Allah, we seek safety for him by Your bond \nof protection with him. Certainly You keep Your word and \npromise. O Allah, protect him from the trials of the grave \nand from the torment of Jahannam. O Allah, forgive him, \nhave mercy on him, pardon him and grant him well-being. \nBe generous to him when he arrives and open the way \nwide for him to come in. Wash him with water, snow and \nice and cleanse him from his wrong actions as a white \ngarment is cleansed of dirt. Give him a home better than \nthe home he had, a family better than the family he had \nand a wife better than the wife he had. O Allah, if he was \nright-acting, increase him in right-actions and if he was \nwrong-doing, then overlook his wrong actions. O Allah, he \nhas come to You and You are the Best that anyone can \ncome to. He is in need of Your mercy and You have no need \nto punish him. O Allah, make his speech firm when he is \nquestioned and do not test him in his grave beyond what \nhe can bear. Do not deprive us of our reward for doing this \non his behalf and do not test us after him.  \n \n21.5 The fourth prayer  \n \nYou say this after each takbir and then after the fourth \ntakbir you say, 'O Allah, forgive those who are alive and \nthose who are dead, those present with us and those \nabsent, those who are young and those who are old, those \nwho are male and those who are female. You know \neverything that we do and where we will end up - and \nforgive our parents and those who have gone before us \nwith iman and all the Muslims both men and women and \nall the Muminun both men and women, the living and the \ndead. O Allah whoever of us You keep alive, keep him alive \nin iman and whoever You take back to Yourself take him \nback as a Muslim. Make us glad when we meet You. Make \nus pleasing at the time of our death and make death \npleasant for us. Make it a source of rest and happiness for \nus,' After this you say the salam.  \n \n21.6 If the dead person is a woman  \n \nIf the dead person is a woman you say, \"O Allah, she is your \nslave and the daughter of Your slaves\" and you go on \nmaking the object of the du'a feminine rather than \nmasculine. The only difference is that you do not say, \"Give \nher a husband better than her husband. . .\" because in the \nGarden she can be the wife of the man who was her \nhusband in this world and the women of the Garden are \nattached only to their husbands and have no desire for \nanyone else. A man may have many wives in the Garden \nwhereas women only have one husband  \n \nNOTE: If you do not know whether the dead person was male or \nfemale, you intend the prayer over the one who is present, as \nwhen you do not know whether it is one or several. You say in \nyour supplication, \"O Allah! They are your slaves and the sons of \nyour slaves,\" and use the masculine plural.  \n \n21.7 Praying over several at once  \n \nThere is no harm in having one funeral prayer for several \ndead people \n  \nThis means it is recommended by a group of scholars as opposed to \nthe one who said that they are not put together and that one prays \nover every dead person on his own. According to the statement \nthat there are several in the same prayer, in what form are the \ncorpses are laid out: is the best put near the Imam and others \ntowards qibla or are they put in one row with the best of them \nnear the Imam? The first is indicated.  \n \n21.7a The best arrangement of the bodies  \n \nIf there are both men and women among the dead, the men \nare placed next to the Imam. If there are only men, the best \nof them is placed next to the Imam. If there are women and \nchildren as well, they are placed behind the men in the \ndirection of the qibla  \n \nWhat he mentioned of putting women before children is based on \nthe position of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). Its \nopposite is well-known: it is that free adult men are near the \nImam, the best and then next best, and then young free men and \nthen hermaphrodites, then male slaves, then free women, then \nyoung girls, then female slaves.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) puts male slaves ahead of \nhermaphrodites  \n \n21.7b Second arrangement: placing them in a row  \n \nThere is no harm in a number of bodies being placed in a \nrow in which case the one nearest the Imam should be the \nbest of them \n  \nThis is when they are all the same type, like all men, all women, \nor all children. When there are men, women and children, the men \nare put in the row in front of the Imam, then children in a row, \nthen women in a row. This is in respect to the corpses. As for the \nImamate, the one with the most knowledge is put first, then the \nbest, then the oldest. Then he discussed when multiple burial is \nnecessary.  \n \n21.7c Multiple burial  \n \nIf a number of people are being buried in one grave the \nbest should be nearest the qibla \n  \nBased on what is in the four Sunan that Shaikh Abu Dawud \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh an-Nasa'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Ibn Majah \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said on the day of Uhud, \"Dig and make it wide and deep \nand good, and bury two and three in the same grave. Put the one \nwith \nthe \nmost \nHoly \nQur'an \nfirst.\" \nShaikh \nat-Tirmidhi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is sahih hasan. It is clear from \nthe words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is absolutely \npermitted to put them together in one grave in case of necessity or \notherwise. That is not the case. If necessity demands it, it is \npermitted. Otherwise, it is disliked. The permission is based on \nnecessity and that is dislike when it is not necessary when they \nare buried at the same time. If we want to bury a corpse on top of \nanother after he has been buried, that it is forbidden because the \ngrave holds the dead and he is not disinterred unless there is a \nnecessity in which case it is not forbidden.  \n \n21.8 Making up a missed prayer  \n \n21.8a When someone has been buried without the prayer  \n \nIf someone has been buried without the funeral prayer \nhaving been done for him and the grave has already been \nfilled in, then the prayer should be done over his grave  \n \nAccording to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that there is no prayer over \nhim. Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi), who is the better, \nsaid, \"As for what is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) prayed on the grave of the poor woman, that was special \nfor her or because he had promised her that he would pray over \nher. “According to the statement that there is a prayer at the \ngrave, it is said that the prayer is said over someone who probably \nwould not have decomposed. It is said that it is not permitted after \ntwo months. It is understood by his words that if the grave has not \nbeen filled in it, he is brought out and prayed over. Even if it has \nbeen filled in and buried, he must be brought out and prayed over \nas long as it is not feared that he has decomposed.  \n \n21.8b No second prayer  \n \nYou do not do the funeral prayer a second time if it has \nalready been done once \n  \nThis is disliked, whether the one who wants to pray the second \ntime is the one who prayed the first time or not.  \n \n21.8c The prayer over most of the body  \n \nThe funeral prayer is done for a person as long as the \nmajority of the body remains \n  \nMeaning two-thirds or more because the judgment of the majority \nis the judgment of the whole. He intends the prayer over all the \ndead person, what is present of him and what is absent. One does \nnot pray over half of a body according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). That is the accepted position, even if it is \nmore than a half and less than two-thirds because it would lead to \nprayer on the absent. A small absence is overlooked because it is \ninconsequential.  \n \n21.8d When only a little of the body is left  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion about whether you do the \nfuneral prayer for, for example, someone's hand or foot \n  \nThe example is applied to the thing itself. So he mentioned the \ndisagreement about the hand and foot. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that one does not pray over it because its owner may \nbe alive. Shaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that one \nprays over the hand or foot and intends the dead person by it, i.e. \nwhen it is probable that its owner is dead.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): It is permissible to visit \nburial places and there are no limitations upon acts of \nremembrance.  \n \nThe place where the dead are buried is legally a kind of habs (non-\nconveyable land). It cannot be sold or alienated or used for any \nother purpose. It is censurable to walk on or pass over a grave.  \n \nGraves should not be opened as long as there are any bones left. \nThey can be opened in certain cases:  \n \nwhere the shrouds were stolen;  \n \nwhere the burial was on someone's property without his \npermission and the owner reclaims his property;  \n \nwhere articles of value were overlooked at the time of burial.  \n \nThe dead should not be buried in silks, impure garments, or in \ngreen, blue, black or carthamine.  \n \nThe bier should not be unusually large or silken things put on it. \nLights should not follow the convoy. The name of the dead should \nbe announced in a loud voice in the masjid or at its door. Private \ninvitations can be sent. You do not have to stand when a convoy \npasses.  \n \nWhen a believer dies at sea, he is thrown into the sea after having \nbeen shrouded when there is no hope of making land before \ndecomposition sets in.  \nA Muslim may not follow an unbeliever to the grave or help to \nlower him in.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-two: On the Supplication \ndone for a Dead Child, how the funeral prayer \nis done for them and how they are washed \n \n \nThis chapter deals with judgments particular to children, meaning \na child who has at least cried out. He begins with the supplication \nwhich is made for him:  \n \n22.1The first three prayers  \n \nYou praise Allah tabaraka wa ta'ala and ask for blessing on \nHis Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) and then you \nsay, \"O Allah, he is your slave and the son of Your slaves. \nYou created him and provided for him. You made him die \nand will bring him to life. Make him a forerunner and a \nstored-up treasure and a reward for his parents. Make \ntheir balances heavy through him and make their reward \ngreater because of him and do not deprive either us or \nthem of their reward through him and do not test either us \nor them after him. O Allah, give him the company of the \nright-acting Muminun who have gone ahead and place him \nunder the guardianship of Ibrahim. Give him a house \nbetter than the one he had and a family better than the one \nhe had. Save him from the trial of the grave and the \ntorment of Jahannam.\"  \n \nThis is said after each takbir except the fourth.  \n \n22.2 The fourth intercession  \n \nYou say this after each takbir and after the fourth you say, \n\"O Allah, forgive our forbears and predecessors and those \nwho have gone before us. O Allah, whoever among us You \nmake live make him live in iman and whoever You take \nback to Yourself take him back as a Muslim. Forgive all the \nMuslims both men and women and all the Muminun both \nmen and women, the living and the dead.\" Then you say the \nsalam \n  \nJust as the salam for the prayer.  \n \n22.3 Stillborn’s  \n \n22.3a No prayer  \n \nYou do not do the funeral prayer for a stillborn baby \n  \nThe still-born is the one who does not cry. Nor is he washed, even \nif he moves, urinates, sneezes or suckles for a little, but not a lot. \nIt is the sign a life. This prohibition is one of dislike. As for the one \nwho cries, he has all the judgments of the living, even if he dies \nimmediately, without dispute.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): it is not buried with \nperfumes or given a name.  \n \n22.3b Legal consequences  \n \nSuch a baby does not inherit and cannot be inherited from. \nIf a baby is prematurely stillborn, it is disliked for its body \nto be buried inside a house \n  \nInheritance is a branch of confirmation of life. So any gifts made \nto him before his birth are returned. He is not buried in the house \nbecause it is feared that if the house is destroyed, the bones will be \ndisinterred.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): if a stillborn child is buried in \nthe house, that does not prevent sale of the house.  \n \n22.4 Who should do the ghusl  \n \n22.4a Women washing boys  \n \nThere is no harm in women washing the body of a young \nboy of six or seven years old \n  \nThey do not wash them when they are old. At such an age, it is not \nobliged for them to cover the private parts because it is permitted \nfor the women to look at the body.  \n \n  \n22.4b Men do not wash girls  \n \nBut men do not wash the bodies of young girls. There is a \ndifference of opinion regarding young girls who have not \nreached an age when they might be desired but the former \njudgment is the one preferred by us \n  \nThe prohibition against men washing a girl is one of forbidding by \nagreement if she is one of those who might be desirable, like six or \nseven. They can wash her if she is still a small baby by agreement, \ni.e. less than three years. There is some disagreement about those \nwho have not reached the age of desirably, Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) permits it by analogy with the women \nwashing a young boy, but Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) forbids it. It is the position of the Mudawwana. The \naccepted position is that of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) because the female is generally desirable.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Four: On Fasting \n \n \nThis also deals with things connected to it like the Tarawih \nprayer. Linguistically \"Siyam\" means to restrain and abandon. \nWhoever forgoes something is said to be fasting. Allah azza wa jall \nsays in the story about Maryam (alaiha salam), \"I have vowed a \nfast to the All-Merciful,\" (Holy Qur‟an 19:26) meaning a silence, \nwhich is withholding from words. In the Shari‟ah, it is to restrain \nthe appetites of the stomach and genitals from dawn to sunset \nwith an intention before or at dawn except in days of \nmenstruation, lochia and the „Ids. Fasting is divided into the \nobligatory and non-obligatory.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): tobacco is also avoided in the \nfast.  \n \n23.1 Its Ruling  \n \nFasting the month of Ramadan is obligatory \n  \nIt is obligatory by the Book, the Sunnah and consensus. Whoever \ndenies that it is obligatory to fast Ramadan is an unbeliever by \nagreement. Whoever affirms its obligation and refuses to fast it is \na rebel and is compelled to do it.  \n \nIt is affirmed that the fast of Ramadan begins by one of two \nthings, either by the month of Sha'ban lasting 30 days or by \nsighting the new moon.  \n \n23.2 Beginning the Fast  \n \n23.2a When the fast begins  \n \nYou start fasting when the new moon is sighted and you \nstop fasting when the new moon is sighted, whether this is \nafter thirty or twenty-nine days. If the new moon cannot be \nseen because of clouds you count thirty days from the \nbeginning of the preceding month and then begin fasting. \nThe same applies to ending the fast \n  \nHis literal words are whether the sighting is exhaustive, when a \ngroup sight it so that its impossible to accuse them of lying \nbecause their report gives information, or with two witnesses of \ngood character only, with clouds or clear skies, meaning there is \nno difference between the large and small town. Similar to the two \nwitnesses of good character is one whose report is trusted, even if \na slave or a woman, when the place does not pay attention to the \nbusiness of the new moon in respect of the people of the seer and \nothers. If the place is concerned with the business of the new \nmoon, the seeing of one does not affirm it, even for his family, and \neven if they believe him, but he must present his business to the \nruler. It is not permitted for him to break the fast. If he breaks it, \nhe disbelieves, even if by interpretation because the interpretation \nis unlikely. The fast is also broken by seeing the moon of \nShawwal. If there are clouds, then you count from the beginning of \nthe month of Sha'ban. The basis for this is what is in the two \nSahih collections that he (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Fast when \nyou see it and break the fast when you see it. If it is cloudy, then \ncomplete the number.\"  \n \nThere are seven preconditions for the fast.  \n \n23.2b 1. The intention  \n \nYou should make an intention to fast the whole month at \nthe beginning of the month and it is not necessary to make \na new intention every night for the rest of the month \n  \nHe should formulate the intention with his heart the first night of \nRamadan after sunset and before dawn or at dawn as an act of \nnearness to Allah azza wa jall by performing what is obliged of \nhim during the day of refraining from eating, drinking and \nintercourse. It is not an obligation to make the intention on the \nrest of the days. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nintention must be made at night, and that is stated by Imam ash-\nShafi‟i(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), because the days of the month are individual acts of \nworship separate from one another. The invalidation of one does \nnot invalidate another, and they are not impaired by what is \ncontrary to them at night, like eating, drinking and intercourse. \nSo the days become like the five prayers during the day. It is \nobliged to give day an intention for the fast as it is obligatory to \nhave an intention for every prayer. The evidence of the Maliki \nSchool is the words of the Almighty, \"So every one of you who is \npresent (at his home) during that month should spend it in \nfasting..\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:185) This command is transferred to one \nfast, which is the fast of the month. The intention is made in the \nnight based on what the authors of the Sunan reported of the \nwords of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam): \"Whoever does \nnot intend the fast before dawn has no fast.\" Advancing it is \noverlooked in the fast because of the difficulty. Shaikh ibn Naji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The literal words of the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is not obliged for someone who \nbreaks the fast, like the menstruating women, to renew the \nintention. That is the case according to Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. There remain the sick person \nand traveler when they continue to fast. They are obliged to make \nthe intention every night because it is not obligatory for them to \ncontinue. When the sick person becomes well and the traveler \narrives, the intention for what remains is enough for them, like \nthe menstruating woman who becomes pure, the child who \nreaches puberty in the fast, and the kafir who becomes a Muslim \nduring the month.  \n \nThe other preconditions are:  \n \n Islam. \n \n Sanity. \n \n Being free of menstruation and lochia.  \n \n Refraining from things that break the fast. \n \nThe ability to fast. \n \nAdulthood.  \n \n23.2c Duration of the fast  \n \nYou fast until night comes  \n \nBased on the ayat and because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said in the Sahih, \"When night advances from there and \nthe day retreats from here and the sun sets, the faster breaks the \nfast.\"  \n \nand it is Sunnah to break the fast as soon as possible  \n \nWhen you are certain the night has come. There is disagreement \nabout continuing after sunset. Some say that it is unlawful as it is \nunlawful on the Day of the „Id. Some say it is permitted and he \nhas the reward of the faster. The fiqh of the question that he has \nthe reward of the faster is weak. The statement that it is unlawful \nis more likely unless his intention is that it is obliged for him. \nOtherwise, it is disliked when it is without necessity.  \n \n23.2d Delaying Sahur  \n \nand to delay your Sahur. If you are not sure if the time of \nFajr has come or not you should not eat \n  \nSahur means what is eaten and Sahur is the act of eating. The \namount of the best delay after finishing eating and drinking there \nremains until Fajr the amount of time it takes to recite 50 ayats. \nThe basis for this is the words of the  Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam), \"My community will continue to be all right as long as \nthey hurry to break the fast and delay the Sahur.\" (Imam Ahmad \n[RA]) If he is unsure of the time of Fajr, he should not eat or drink \nor have intercourse. This can mean prohibition or dislike. The \nwell-known position is that it is a prohibition. If he is unsure \nabout sunset, it is unlawful to eat and otherwise break the fast by \nagreement.  \n \n23.2e Not fasting the Day of Doubt  \n \nYou do not fast the 'day of doubt', fasting on the grounds \nthat it might be part of Ramadan \n  \nThis prohibition is one of dislike according to the probable text of \nthe Mudawwana. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"What is probable is that it is a prohibition based on what \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in a hasan sahih \nhadith: Shaikh Ammar ibn Yasir (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"Whoever fasts the Day of Doubt, has rebelled against Abu'l-\nQasim (the Holy Prophet) (alaihi salat wa salam).\"  \n \nWe consider the Day of Doubt which is forbidden to fast to be the \nday when it was cloudy on the night of the 29th and vision was not \nestablished, and so the morning of that night is the Day of Doubt.  \n \n23.2f Its judgment when it is fasted  \n \nIf you do this it is not counted even if it turns out to have \nbeen Ramadan \n  \nIf you fast the Day of Doubt out of caution and then it is \nestablished to be Ramadan, it is not counted because the intention \nwas not firm.  \n \nIf you want to fast that day as a voluntary fast, however, \nyou can do so \n  \ni.e. this is when it is his custom to fast.  \n \n23.2g When you discover it is Ramadan in the morning  \n \nIf you get up in the morning and discover, before having \neaten or drunk anything, that Ramadan has begun you \nmust fast the rest of the day but you cannot count it as one \nof the days of your Ramadan and you have to make up a \nday \n  \nIf this happens, you have to make it up by the lack of the \nintention. Nevertheless you must avoid food and drink and \nanything that would invalidate the prayer for the rest of the day. \nIt is also obligatory for him to fast if he has eaten or drunk or the \nlike. He makes it up, but there is no kaffarah since he forgot or it \nwas intentional by interpretation. If it is something else, then he \nmust do kaffarah.  \n \n23.2h When someone returns from a journey or stops \nmenstruating  \n \nIf someone returns from a journey and they are not fasting \nor if a woman finishes menstruating during the day then in \nboth these cases it is all right for them to eat and drink \nduring the remainder of that day \n  \nThis in the daytime. It is not recommended for them to refrain. It \nis the same in the case of the child who reaches maturity, the \nmadman who recovers his senses, the sick person who starts out \nnot fasting and then becomes well. It is the same for the one who \nfaints and then regains consciousness, the one compelled by the \nnecessity of hunger or thirst, and the nursing woman whose child \ndies in the day. It is the same for an unbeliever who becomes \nMuslim, although it is recommended for him to refrain which is \nnot the case with the others. As for the one who breaks his fast by \nforgetfulness or on the Day of Doubt or is forced to break it, and \ntheir excuse is removed, then it is obligatory for them to refrain. \nWhen the one forced breaks his fast after the compulsion is \nremoved, he must make it up with kaffarah unless there was a \nvalued interpretation.  \n \n23.3 The ruling on breaking a voluntary fast  \n \n23.3a Breaking it intentionally  \n \nIf you are doing a voluntary fast and break your fast \nintentionally, or if you start off on a journey and break \nyour fast because of it, you must make up that day \n  \nWithout compulsion or excuse, or because you set off on a journey \nwhile observing a voluntary fast and then break it because of it: it \nis obligatory to make it up in both cases. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that there is disagreement about when \nhe breaks it intentionally: is it recommended to fast for the rest of \nit or is that not recommended as Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said?   \n \n23.3b Breaking it unintentionally  \n \nIf in a voluntary fast you break your fast unintentionally \nyou do not have to make up a day but if this happens in the \nobligatory fast you have to make up a day \n  \nThere is no disagreement that it is not obligatory to make it up if \nit is unintentional, but there is a disagreement about whether it is \nrecommended and there are two positions. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) heard that it is recommended. When the \nobligatory fast is unintentionally broken, it must be made up. \nShaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The literal meaning of \nhis (alaihi salat wa salam) words is that the obligatory is in \nRamadan or elsewhere.\"  \n \n23.4 Things which break or do not break the fast  \n \n23.4a Siwak  \n \nThere is no harm in using a siwak at any time during the \nday while you are fasting  \n \nThis is stated in the Mudawwana. It means it is permissible, as \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated, \"The siwak is \npermitted every day as long as nothing splits off from it. It is \ndisliked to moisten it.\" Some of them said that it is permitted after \nmidday for the one who does not have a legal requirement. As for \na legal requirement like wudu', the prayer, recitation and dhikr, it \nis recommended. That is correct as the hadith shows in the words \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"If it were not that it \nwould be hard on my community, I would command them to use \nthe siwak for every prayer.\" So this includes the person who is \nfasting.  \n \nWhen he says, \"during the day while you are fasting\" that alludes \nto the words of Imam ash-Shafi‟i(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam \nAhmad ibn Hanbal (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is preferred before \nmidday and disliked after it based on what is in the Sahih where \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  said, 'The odor of the \nmouth of the faster is sweeter with Allah than the scent of musk.\" \nThat is because of Allah azza wa jall's pleasure with him and His \npraise for the faster.  \n \n23.4b Blood-letting  \n \nand blood-letting is not disliked except if doing it will \ncause over-exhaustion \n  \ni.e. illness. In the dictionary, it means to expose oneself to death. \nTherefore cupping is only disliked when illness is feared because \nhe is unsure about health and its absence. If he knows it is safe, \nthere is no dislike.  \n \n23.4c Vomiting  \n \nIf you vomit involuntarily while fasting in Ramadan you do \nnot have to make up a day  \n \nIf it is in Ramadan or another day, there is no obligation or \nrecommendation to make it up, whether it is for a reason or \nsimply on account of fullness, and whether the food has been \naltered or not. This is when he knows that none of it went back to \nhis stomach after reaching his mouth. If he knows that some of it \nwent back after it reached his mouth, then he must make it up \nwhen it is unintentional. Otherwise he owes kaffarah. He must \nalso make it up if he is unsure about that. Undigested food is like \nvomit. It is what emerges from the mouth of the intestines when \nthey are full. As for phlegm which reaches the end of the tongue \nand he swallows it deliberately, there is no making up. It is the \nsame with spit which he collects in his month and then swallows. \nHe does not have to make anything up.  \n \n23.4d Swallowing vomit  \n \nbut if you make yourself vomit you have to make up a day \n  \nThere are two statements about whether this is obligatory or \nrecommended. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that \nthe first is well-known, and it is preferred. Shaikh ibn al-Jallab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred the second. The literal words of \nthe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that there is no kaffarah for \nthe one who makes himself vomit in Ramadan. There is some \ndisagreement in the question about whether or not there is \nkaffarah. Shaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he \nmakes it up and does kaffarah. Shaikh ibn al-Majishun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the one who makes himself vomit \nintentionally without illness must make it up and do kaffarah. \nShaikh Abu'l-Faraj (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) had been asked about the like of it, he would \nhave obliged kaffarah. It is related from Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he just makes it up.  \n \nKnow that breaking the fast in Ramadan is obligatory in certain \ncases and permitted in some. The first category is when a woman \nmenstruates during the day: she must break the fast for the rest \nof the days.  \n \n23.5 Pregnant and nursing women  \n \n23.5a Pregnant women  \n \nIf a pregnant woman is afraid on account of the child in \nher womb she should break the fast. She does not have to \nfeed anyone in expiation. It has also been said that she \nshould feed people \n  \nIf she fears for her child or herself or that she will become ill, she \nbreaks the fast and that is obligatory. According to the well-known \nposition, she does not feed people, but simply makes it up. It is \nsaid that she should feed as related by Shaikh ibn Wahb \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). What is understood from his words is that it \nis when she does not fear, she does not break it even if the fast \nexhausts her. That is not the case. If the fast exhausts her, she \ncan choose to break it. What is derived from what Shaikh ibn \n'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says is that the pregnant woman, \nnursing woman and sick person can break the fast when fasting if \nit is difficult for them, even if they do not fear illness or its \nincrease. The healthy person cannot break the fast when it is \ndifficult. There are two statements about whether he breaks the \nfast out of fear of illness. Part of the second, which is that illness \npermits it in some cases, is when he fears increased or continuing \nillness. If he fears death or great harm, then he must break it. In \nthe fear which permits breaking the fast, the person relies on the \ndoctor's statement, or his own personal experience, or the \nexperience of someone with a constitution like him. Travel has its \npreconditions which will be discussed.  \n \n23.5b Nursing women  \n \nSimilarly, if a nursing mother fears for her child and \ncannot find a wet nurse, or if the child will not accept to be \nfed by anyone else, she can break the fast but she must \nfeed people in expiation \n  \nThis is permission if she fears for her child or herself on account of \nfasting. In such a case she must feed people. It is also said that it \nis an obligation to break the fast and feed people.  \n \n23.6 The old  \n \nIf an old man cannot fast, it is recommended for him to \nfeed people \n  \nIf he is unable to fast at any time, he is permitted to break the fast \nby the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"No self is charged beyond what \nit can bear,\"(Holy Qur‟an 2:233) and \"He has not placed any \nconstraint on you in the din.\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:78) The literal text \nof the Mudawwana is contrary to what he mentioned of the \nrecommendation to feed. He says that there is no fidya. However, \nthe Mudawwana relates that he is not obliged to feed and so that \nis not contrary to the recommendation.  \n \n23.7 Feeding people (Fidya)  \n \n23.7a Its amount  \n \nFeeding people in this context consists of giving away one \nmudd for each day which has to be made up \n  \nFeeding is done by the pregnant woman fearful for what is in her \nwomb, the nursing mother who fear for her child, and the very old \nman who cannot fast is a mudd, by the Holy Prophet's (alaihi salat \nwa salam) mudd.  \n \n23.7b Its ruling  \n \nSomeone who fails to make up missed days before the \nfollowing Ramadan should also feed a poor person for each \nday they still owe \n  \nThe ruling varies because the feeding done by an old person, as \nwas said, is recommended. The feeding of a nursing woman is \nobligatory. The literal sense of his words is that making up \nRamadan is at leisure, and it is what is indicated by the hadith of \n'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) in the Muwatta'. She (radhi‟Allahu \nanha) said, \"I used to have to make up days from Ramadan and \nnot be able to fast them until Sha'ban came because I was busy \nwith the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam).\" So it is evident that \nit permissible to delay it until Sha'ban, even if what was delayed \nbecomes immediately obligatory. That shows that the obligation is \nwide. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it should be \nimmediate, but that is weak. According to the first statement, he \nis considered to be lax in Sha'ban when he is healthy and at home, \nand so they must feed. When he owes 15 days, then residence and \nhealth are considered at the last half of Ramadan and feeding is \nobligatory if he is sound and resident. If he is ill in it or on a \njourney, there is no feeding. According to the second, laxity is \nconsidered in Shawwal according to what he owes of fasting based \non analogy with what we said about Sha'ban. If Ramadan is 30 \nand he fasts a month to make it up and it is 29, then he completes \nthe 30. It is permitted to make it up at any time in which it is \npermitted to fast voluntarily. It is not made up in days when it is \nforbidden to fast.  \n \n23.8 Children  \n \nChildren are not obliged to fast until such time as a boy \nhas his first wet dream or a girl her first menstrual period \nbecause it is when children reach physical maturity that \nall the physical acts of worship become obligatory for \nthem. Allah azza wa jall says, \"When your children reach \nphysical maturity they should seek permission (to enter).\" \n(Holy Qur’an 24:59)  \n \nOne of the preconditions for the fast is being an adult. It is neither \nobligatory nor recommended for children to fast. Maturity is by \nejaculation or age which is 18 in the well-known position. This is \ndifferent from the prayer. It is recommended to command them to \ndo it. Maturity is what brings the person from childhood to \nmanhood and sense. All acts - prayer, fasting, hajj and raiding - \nare obligatory for them, as well as actions of the heart, like the \nobligation of intentions which are obligatory because the intention \nis one of the actions of the heart, and creeds like the belief that \nAllah is One, for example. Evidence that obligations become \nincumbent children when they reach maturity is in the words of \nAllah azza wa jall. Asking permission is obliged then and is \nconnected to maturity.  \n \n23.9 Defilement’s  \n \nIf someone who has not done ghusl wakes up after Fajr in a \nstate of janaba or if the period of a woman who has been \nmenstruating finishes before Fajr and she does not do \nghusl till after Fajr, then fasting that day is valid in both \nthese cases \n  \nThis is either from intercourse or an intentional or unintentional \nwet-dream in an obligatory or voluntary fast, or a woman has her \nperiod stop and sees that she is pure before Fajr. If they do not \nhave a ghusl until after dawn, even if they are able to do, their \nfast is still allowed and they owe nothing. The validity of the fast \nof the person in janaba is that it is confirmed that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) was in janaba at Fajr in Ramadan \nand he (alaihi salat wa salam) had a ghusl and fasted. As for the \nvalidity of the menstruating woman whom becomes pure before \nFajr in Ramadan, it is agreed that that is when she is pure before \nFajr with the amount in which she could wash. According to the \nwell-known position that also applies to the amount of time in \nwhich it is not possible to wash. If she becomes pure after Fajr, \nher fast is not valid.  \n \n23.10 On Feast days  \n \n23.10a Not allowed on the ‘Id  \n \nFasting is not permitted on the day of ‘Id al-Fitr or the day \nof the ‘Id al-Adha nor should anyone fast the two days after \nthe ‘Id al-Adha unless he is doing Hajj Tamatt'a and does \nnot have an animal to sacrifice \n  \nAs it is not permitted, it is not valid since it is forbidden by the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) to fast them.  \n \n23.10b The fourth day  \n \nThere should be no voluntary fasting on the fourth day \neither but if someone has vowed to fast or has previously \nbroken off a consecutive fast, they should fast that day \n  \nThe fourth day after the Day of Sacrifice is not made a voluntary \nfast. It is fasted by someone who has fasted Shawwal and Dhu'l-\nQa'da for kaffarah for a dhihar divorce or murder and then \nbecomes ill and regains his health in the fourth night. He can fast \nit.  \n \n23.11 Making up the fast  \n \n23.11a Breaking the fast out of forgetfulness  \n \nIf you break the fast in Ramadan out of forgetfulness you \nonly have to make up that day \n  \nYou are obliged to continue to fast and to abstain through the rest \nof day of Ramadan. You are obliged to continue to fast when you \nbreak it by forgetfulness in an obligatory fast other than \nRamadan. There is no making up in the well-known position. One \nshould be careful about forgetting. When you break it \nintentionally you owe kaffarah as well as making up. That is why \nhe says \"only\" since he said he owes no kaffarah because which \ndiffers from Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nShaikh Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) who say that there is \nkaffarah if he breaks it through intercourse based on the hadith of \nthe bedouin who came to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nbeating his chest and pulling his hair, saying, \"I am destroyed! I \nam destroyed!\" The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) asked \nhim, \"What is the reason for this?\" He replied, \"I had intercourse \nwith my wife in Ramadan\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) commanded \nhim to do kaffarah. The reply to that by the Maliki masters is that \nthe circumstances of striking himself and pulling his hair indicate \nthat the intercourse was intentional.  \n \n23.11b Breaking the fast because of illness  \n \nThe same applies if you are forced to break the fast due to \nillness \n  \nWhen the fast is too difficult, or when he fears that the illness will \ncontinue longer, or increase, or healing will be delayed, he only \nhas to make it up without kaffarah. If it is an illness in which it is \nnot difficult to fast or in which increased illness or delay of health \nis not feared, and he breaks his fast, then he must make it up and \ndo kaffarah.  \n \n23.12 A Traveler  \n \n23.12a Length of journey  \n \nIf you are on a journey for which you can shorten the \nprayer you are permitted to break the fast even if there is \nno particular need to do so, making up any days missed \nlater, but according to us it is better to fast \n  \nIf you go on a journey at the time of the intention such that you \nwill reach a limit where shortening the prayers begins before \ndawn. So the distance is four or more mail stages of a return \njourney, and it should not be a journey involving disobedience of \nAllah azza wa jall. You are permitted to break it, eat, drink and \nhave intercourse. This is even if the journey is not necessary. \nThere is no disagreement that he must make up the fast by the \nwords of the Almighty, \"the prescribed number should be made up \nfrom days later,\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:184) The Malikis prefer that the \none who is strong enough should fast because the Almighty says, \n\"It is better for you if you fast.\"  \n \n23.12b A journey of less than the minimum  \n \nIf anyone travels less than four mail stages (48 miles) and \nbreaks the fast thinking it is permissible to do so, they do \nnot have to do kaffarah although they must make up the \nday. \n[Anyone \nwho \nbreaks \nthe \nfast \nthrough \nan \ninterpretation does not have to do kaffarah]  \n \nBecause he followed an interpretation. He is only obliged to make \nit up without dispute. The literal words about the one who uses \ninterpretation not owing kaffarah are unrestricted, but there is a \nwell-known disagreement. The interpretation must be a likely one. \nThere is no kaffarah because he is excused by relying on a strong \nreason. If the interpretation is unlikely, which is when its reason \nis not strong, then there is kaffarah. One of the cases in which is \nthe reason is strong is the case we mentioned about the old man, \nand the one who breaks the fast out of forgetfulness and then \nbreaks it intentionally that it is permitted: he owes no kaffarah. \nThere is also the case of the person in janaba or menstruating \nbefore dawn who only had a ghusl for that after Fajr and thought \nthat the fast for that day was not obliged and deliberately did not \nfast: he has no kaffarah. There is the case of someone who has \nSahur at Fajr and thinks that the fast for that day is not binding \nand so he breaks it after that intentionally: he owes no kaffarah. \nThere is the one who arrives after a journey at night in Ramadan \nand thinks that he does not have to fast the morning of that day \nand that one of the preconditions of the obligation of the fast is \nthat he come from the journey before sunset. and so he breaks it \ndeliberately: he owes no kaffarah.  \n \nUnlikely cases are those in which the cause is weak. If he sees the \nmoon of Ramadan and his testimony is not accepted and he thinks \nthat the fast is not binding for him and so he breaks it - he owes \nkaffarah. Part of it is the person who normally has a fever every \nthree days and so when the day he comes he breaks the fast and \nthen the fever comes to him on that day. He is obliged to do \nkaffarah, and even more so if it does not come. One is the woman \nwho normally menstruates on a particular day and so she does not \nfast that day and then she menstruates later in the day. One of \nthem is the one slanders a person in Ramadan and thinks that \nthat invalidates his fast because he ate the meat of his the flesh of \nhis brother and so he breaks it intentionally. He must do kaffarah, \nand make it up.  \n \n23.13 Kaffarah  \n \n23.13a Who owes kaffarah  \n \nKaffarah only applies to people who break the fast \ndeliberately \neither \nby \neating, \ndrinking, \nor \nsexual \nintercourse \n  \nIf he resolves to eat and drink or have intercourse, but does not do \nit, he owes nothing, either making it up or kaffarah. It is same for \nsomeone who resolves to break wudu' by breaking wind, for \ninstance, and does not do it- he does not have to do wudu'.  \n \nIn the case of intercourse, one distinguishes the deliberate from \nthe forgetful and the ignorant, i.e. the one who was ignorant of the \nprohibition and the one who did not rely on anything, like \nsomeone who is a new Muslim who believes that fasting does not \nforbid intercourse, for instance, and so does it -he owes no \nkaffarah.  \n \n23.13b Making up the day  \n \nThe actual day when the kaffarah was incurred must also \nbe made up on top of the kaffarah itself \n  \nMaking it up is obliged as well as the kaffarah.  \n \n23.13c What kaffarah consists of:  \n \nThe kaffarah on account of eating, drinking, or intercourse \ndeliberately in Ramadan by abuse or unlikely interpretation is one \nof three things from which one can choose.  \n \n23.13d 1. Feeding sixty people  \n \nThe kaffarah for breaking the fast consists of feeding sixty \npoor people with one mudd for each person using the \nmudd of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). This is the \npreferred way of doing kaffarah according to us.  \n \nIt is taken from the normal food of the one who expiates or from \nthe dominant food of the people: there is disagreement on that. \nShaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said: \"That proceeds \naccording to the disagreement about kaffarah,\" i.e. the kaffarah of \nthe oath, and the zakat al-fitr. The preferred position is that it is \nthe food of the people of the land. It is understood from in his \nwords about 'sixty', as in the Mudawwana, that it is not satisfied \nby giving 30 poor people two mudds each. If he gives to less than \nsixty, he takes back from each of them what is more than a mudd \nif it is in his possession and completes the sixty. If that has been \nconsumed, he cannot take it back because he is the one who gave \nthem power over that. What is meant by the poor person here is \nnot what is meant by it in zakat, i.e. the one who does not have \nanything. What is meant is the one in need of it and the poor \nperson who does not have food for that year. There disagreement \nabout which of the three types is best. The well-known position is \nthat it is feeding and that is what is stated here. It is preferred by \nsome of the people of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) because it \nhas more benefit.  \n \n23.13e 2. Freeing a slave  \n \nHowever, it is also possible to carry out kaffarah by freeing \na slave  \n \nThe second is freeing a slave. It is a precondition that it be a \nbeliever free of defects - like blind, dumb, or mad.  \n \n23.13f 3. Fasting two months  \n \nor fasting for two consecutive months \n  \nThe third is to fast for two consecutive months. Kaffarah is \ncounted by the days.  \n \n23.13g Eating while making up  \n \nSomeone who breaks the fast deliberately while making up \na day of Ramadan does not have to do kaffarah  \n \nThis is because kaffarah is one of the special things of Ramadan, \nand there is no disagreement in what we mentioned according to \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi). The disagreement is \nwhether one or two days are made up. It is preferable that he \nmakes it two, as Shaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \nNOTE: Making up Ramadan is valid on separate or consecutive \ndays, but doing it consecutively is better.  \n \n23.14 Unconsciousness  \n \n23.14a When someone regains consciousness after Fajr  \n \nIf someone becomes unconscious during the night and \nrecovers consciousness after Fajr he should make up a day \n  \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said he is not commanded \nto refrain from eating for the rest of the day. Loss of consciousness \nis the removal of sense by an illness which afflicts him, as stated \nin at-Tahqiq. That which he relied on is the commentator of \nKhalil. The relied-on position is that if he is unconscious for all or \nmost of the day, he must make it up, whether he is sound at the \nbeginning of it or not. If he is unconscious for less than half of it, \nand is sound in the beginning of it, it is allowed. Otherwise it is \nnot. We said 'sound at the beginning,' meaning conscious at the \ntime of the intention, even if it he was unconscious before it and \nrecovers before Fajr for the amount of time in which he could do it, \neven he did not, according to the relied on position. This is when \nhe made the intention in the night before it so that it is included \nin the intention for the month. Otherwise it is not, because there \nmust be an intention since it is not valid without the intention. \nThe one intoxicated by something lawful is like the unconscious \nperson in the details mentioned, but the one who becomes \nintoxicated by something unlawful at night and remains drunk \nmust make it up. If a sleeper makes the intention at the beginning \nof the month and then sleeps for the entire mouth, his fast is valid \nand he is free of responsibility.  \n \n23.14b Prayers which must be made up  \n \nHe only has to make up a missed prayer if he comes to \nduring the time it is due \n  \nIf he fainted at night and wakes up after dawn. This was covered \nin the Chapter of Prayer. He repeats it here to point out that the \nfast is different from the prayer. The menstruating woman makes \nup the fast but no the prayer because of the difficulty of repeating \nit.  \n \n23.15 Other Prohibitions in the Fast  \n \n23.15a Guarding the tongue and limbs  \n \nWhen you are fasting you should guard your tongue and \nlimbs  \n \nThat is recommended, and some say it is obligatory, and there is \nno contradiction between the two positions. The one who says it is \nobligatory applies to refraining from the forbidden, and the one \nwho recommends it applies it to refraining from what is not \nforbidden, like excessive permissive speech.  \n \nHe mentions the limbs which are seven: hearing, sight, tongue, \nhands, feet, belly and genitals. The tongue is mentioned \nspecifically because it results in the greatest calamities. It is said \nthat there is not a morning but the limbs complain to the tongue, \n\"We ask you by Allah, go straight and we will be straight. If you \nare crooked, we will be crooked. 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  \nvisited Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and found him pulling his \ntongue. He said, ' What, Abu Bakr!\" He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"Leave me. It has brought about things.\" People should curtail \nwhat they say in Ramadan.  \n \n23.15b Honoring the month of Ramadan  \n \nand honor the month of Ramadan as Allah azza wa jall has \nhonored it \n  \nAllah azza wa jall says \"the month of Ramadan in which the \nQur'an was revealed.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:185) It is honored by the \nrecitation of Holy Qur'an, dhikr, fasting, praying, sadaqa, and \nother acts of worship. It is disliked to esteem it by decorations and \ndelegations and the like.  \n \n23.15c Avoidance of sexual pleasure in the day  \n \nA fasting man may not have sexual intercourse during the \ndaytime in Ramadan nor may he touch a woman or kiss \nher to gain pleasure \n  \nIntercourse is forbidden by agreement. Other things are said to be \nharam or disliked. It is possible to say that there is no \ncontradiction, and it is possible that the illicitness is applied when \nhe does not know that there is security and dislike when he knows \nit. In short, it is disliked for the old and young, male or female, to \nkiss his spouse or slavegirl while he is fasting, or to touch or dally. \nIt is the same for looking or remembering when he knows that he \nis safe from sperm and prostatic fluid. If he knows that he is not \nsafe or is unsure about it, it is unlawful. It is not unlawful for him \nin the night unless he is doing I‟tikaf or fasting for the kaffarah of \na dhihar-divorce. In such a case the day and night are the same. If \nhe does any of that while fasting and is safe, he owes nothing. If \nhe ejaculates, he must make it up and do kaffarah.  \n \n23.15d Sexual pleasure allowed at night  \n \nNone of these things, however, is haram for him during the \nnight \n  \nThis is because the Almighty says: \"Lawful to you on the night of \nthe fast is going to your wives...\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:187) Night and \nday are the same for the one doing I‟tikaf and fasting the kaffarah \nfor dhihar.  \n \n23.15e Waking up in janaba  \n \nIt does not matter if you wake up in the morning in a state \nof janaba because of having had sexual intercourse \n  \nHere he repeats this point to clarify that the fast is valid if you are \nin janaba.  \n \n23.15f Emission of madhy in Ramadan  \n \nIf you do get sexual pleasure during the daytime by \ntouching or kissing and this results in the emission of \nmadhy (prostatic fluid) you must make up that day \n  \nOr through looking or thinking, then he must make up the day for \nthe emission of madhy, whether it lasts or not. For the emission of \nmadhy for any reason, there is only making up, which is \nobligatory. If there is no madhy, there is no making up, even if \nthere is an erection. It is what Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), and Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) related from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-Mudawwana. It is the \npreferred position.  \n \n23.15g Emission of sperm in Ramadan  \n \nIf you do it deliberately and the result is the ejaculation of \nany (semen) you have to do the kaffarah \n \nAccording to the well-known position. He is silent about looking \nand remembering. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) say \nthat if he continues to look until he ejaculates, then he must make \nit up and do kaffarah. If he does not continue to do it, then he \nmust only make it up according to the well-known position. \nShaikh al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if he looks once \ndeliberately, he must make it up and do kaffarah. Shaikh al-Baji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is sound and gave remembering \nthe same judgment as the glance. If he continues to remember \nuntil he ejaculates, then he must make up and do kaffarah. If he \ndoes not continue to do it, then he makes it up without kaffarah.  \n \n23.15h The reward for fasting  \n \nAnyone \nwho \nfasts \nRamadan \nwith \nbelief \nand \nwith \nawareness of the reward for doing it is forgiven all his \nprevious wrong actions \n  \nHe believes in the reward if he fasts with the awareness that its \nreward has been stored up for him by Allah azza wa jall in the \nNext World and he does not fast in order to show off or for \nreputation. The wrong actions forbidden are the minor ones \nbetween him and his Lord. Major wrong actions are only expiated \nby repentance or Allah azza wa jall's forgiveness.   \n \n23.16 The Tarawih Prayer  \n \n23.16a The reward for praying at night  \n \nIf you stand up in prayer during the night, to the extent \nthat you able to do so, you can expect great good from it \nand pardon for your wrong actions \n  \nThe reward for standing in prayer is not limited to all the night, \nbut is obtained by anyone who stands for part of it according to his \nstate without limit.  \n \n23.16b Tarawih prayers are performed with an Imam in a \ngroup  \n \nThese night prayers are done with an Imam in masjids \nwhere the prayer is normally done in jama'a \n  \nIt is permitted to do these prayers in the masjid in groups with an \nImam. This is an exception from the dislike of praying the nafila \nin group which is indicated by the words of Shaikh Khalil \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), added to the dislike of gathering for nafila \nor in a known place since the action to gather for them continued \nfrom the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu). Part of \nhis (alaihi salat wa salam) sunan is to do this and the time they \nare done is after 'Isha'.  \n \n23.16c They can be done at home  \n \nIf you want to you can do these night prayers at home. \nIndeed this is considered better if your intention is strong \nenough for you to do them by yourself \n  \nIt is considered better to do them at home on you own if you are \nnot too lazy.  \n \n23.16d How the Salaf first did them  \n \nThe righteous people of the first community used to do \nthese prayers in the masjid. They did twenty rak’ats \nfollowed by three rak’ats - two for shaf'i and one for witr \nwith a salam in between \n  \nThese are the Companions, peace be upon all of them. They did \nthem in the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu) in \nthe masjid with 20 rak'ats. That is preferred by a group, including, \nImam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi), Imam ash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi), and \nthe action now does that followed by the shaf'i and witr. Imam \nAbu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that there is no salam \nbetween the two, and Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat there is a choice.  \n \n23.16e The later practice of the Salaf  \n \nLater they began praying thirty-six rak’ats not including \nthe shaf'i and witr. Both of these are acceptable  \n \nThen the Salaf other than the first Salaf, namely the Tabi'un, \nincreased it. 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ncommanded them to do that since it contained benefit because \nthey were making the recitation long which caused boredom and \nweariness, and so he commanded them to shorten the recitation \nand increase the rak'ats. That which 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did was preferred by Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) in the Mudawwana.  \n \n23.16f Done in groups of two rak'ats  \n \nYou say the salam after each two rak’ats. 'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu anha), said that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam), never did more than twelve rak’ats followed by a \nsingle rak’at of witr, either in Ramadan or out of it \n  \nThen he explains how the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nthem according to 'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) which differs from \nwhat is in the Muwatta' where she says that he did not exceed \ntwelve at any time, Ramadan or not. It also differs from what is \nrelated from her that he prayed 15 and 17. Other things are \nrelated from his (alaihi salat wa salam) wives and they can be \ncombined if the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) first prayed \ntwo to greet the masjid and then stood to do tahajjud with two \nquick rakat‟s to start. When he left for the Subh prayer he prayed \nthe two rak'ats of Fajr. So they can be added together.  \n \n1.  Sahur is the meal eaten before Fajr prior to a day's fasting.  \n \n2. Thirtieth of Sha'ban if the new moon has not been seen the \nprevious night.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Four: On I’tikaf \n \n \nThis comes after fasting because it is prescribed as a result of \nfasting. He begins with its ruling:  \n \n24.1 Its Ruling  \n \nI’tikaf is a meritorious voluntary act. It derives from a \nword meaning 'to stay in one place' \n  \nIt is best done in the last ten days of Ramadan since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. Linguistically it means \ndevotion to a thing and sticking to it. In the Shari‟ah, it means \nthat the Muslim clings to the masjid for dhikr, the prayer, \nrecitation of the Holy Qur'an while fasting and refraining from \nintercourse and things which lead to it for a day or more with an \nintention. This definition includes its pillars which are: Islam, \ndiscrimination and being in a masjid, and what was mentioned of \ndhikr, prayer, etc., and refraining from intercourse and things \nleading up to it. Its pillars designate that on which the reality of \nthe thing is based. It is an act of devotion with those \nqualifications.  \n \n24.2 Preconditions  \n \n24.2a Fasting  \n \nYou can only do itikaf if you are fasting  \n \nIn the well-known position. It is not valid for someone who is not \nfasting, even on account of a valid excuse, as opposed to the one \nwho says that the I‟tikaf of the old man who cannot fast is valid \nand the physically weak and that fasting is not a precondition of \nitikaf in the school. Another precondition is:  \n \n24.2b Consecutive  \n \nand if it is consecutive and  \n \nAs long as he has not vowed it separately. If he does vow that, \nthen consecutiveness is not obliged.  \n \n24.2c In a masjid  \n \nin a masjid, as in the words of Allah azza wa jall, 'While you \nare doing I’tikaf in masjids'  \n \nIt is not valid in houses, shops and other such places. I‟tikaf is \nvalid in any masjid, even if there are only three masjids in a town.  \n \n24.3 Concerning the masjid  \n \nIf the town is one where there is a Jumu'a, then itikaf must be \ndone in the jama'a masjid, unless you are fulfilling a vow to do a \ncertain number of days in i‟tikaf and these do not include the day \nof Jumu'a.  \n \nIf there is a Jumu'a and he is someone who is obliged to go to \nJumu'a and vows some days of which Jumu'a is one. So it must be \nin the Jama'a masjid in which Jumu'a is sound. It is not valid on \nthe roof of the masjid nor in an adjoining house or washing place, \nnor in a storehouse since they enclose him and so resemble shops.  \n \n  \n24.4 Its length  \n \n24.4a The best length  \n \nAccording to us it best to do at least ten days \n  \nIn the Maliki school at least ten are recommended. Its most \ncomplete form is a month and it is disliked to do more. There is an \nopinion that its minimum is a day and a night and most complete \nis ten days and more than that is disliked, or different to what is \nbest.  \n \n24.4b Other lengths  \n \nHowever, if someone makes a vow to do I’tikaf for one day \nor more, they must fulfill their vow. If the vow was just for \none night, they must do I’tikaf for a day and a night \n  \nThe literal meaning would be that if he vowed a day, the night is \nnot necessary. That is not the case. The school of the Mudawwana \nis different. If he vows a day, a day and a night is obliged. If you \nsaid this is unclear since how can he be obliged with what is \ndisliked because the Mudawwana makes it clear that it is disliked \nfor less than ten days according to the position that the minimum \nof what is recommended is ten days, the answer is that he is \nspeaking about what he vows. It is obliged it even if it is disliked. \nShaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it. The well-\nknown position is that he must do a day and a night if he vows a \nnight. Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is invalid \nbecause if someone vows I‟tikaf in the night without the \nprecondition, it is not valid.  \n \n24.5 Breaking the fast while in I’tikaf  \n \n24.5a. Deliberately  \n \nIf someone in I’tikaf deliberately breaks their fast, they \nhave to begin their I’tikaf all over again  \n \nThis is by eating or drinking. There is a difference between what \nis deliberate or forgetful as stated in the Mudawwana. Illness and \nmenstruation are in the same category as forgetfulness. So when \nhe eats out of forgetfulness or becomes ill or a woman \nmenstruates, they do not have to begin again since it is not \ninvalidated and he makes it up after the excuse which broke the \nretreat no longer exists.  \n \n24.5b Intercourse in I’tikaf  \n \nand the same applies to someone who has sexual \nintercourse while in I’tikaf whether during the day or the \nnight and whether it is through forgetfulness or deliberate \n  \nHe adds in the Mudawwana \"or kisses, has contact or touches.\" \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, \"even if there is no \npleasure.\" Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan (rahmatullahi alaihi) qualifies it \nby experiencing or intending pleasure even if he does not feel it.  \n \n24.5c Falling ill while in I’tikaf  \n \nIf you fall ill in I’tikaf you can return home but you should \ncomplete your I’tikaf when you are well again \n  \nIf the illness prevents the person from remaining in the masjid or \nfasting rather than remaining in the masjid, he must return home \nwith the illness which prevents remaining in the masjid, and is \npermitted to do so there is an impediment to fasting only. \nAccording to Shaikh ar-Rajraji (rahmatullahi alaihi) he is obliged \nto remain in the masjid. When he is healthy he returns the masjid \nand resumes the I‟tikaf, rather than making up.  \n \n24.5d Menstruating in I’tikaf  \n \nThe same applies to a woman who starts to menstruate in \nI’tikaf \n  \nOr has bleeding from childbirth. She leaves and resumes it later.  \n \n24.5e Restrictions which continue to apply  \n \nThe restrictions of I’tikaf continue to apply to both sick \npeople and women who are menstruating during the time \nthey are away from the masjid. When the woman regains \nher purity she should return immediately to the masjid \nwhether this happens by night or by day \n  \nSo they are not permitted to do outside the masjid what is \nincompatible \nwith \nI‟tikaf \nexcept \nnot \nfasting. \nWhen \nthe \nmenstruating woman becomes pure and has a ghusl, or the sick \nperson recovers, whether it be night or day, they return to the \nmasjid immediately. If they do not return at that time, they \nrestart according to the well-known position. If they return, that \nday is not counted because of the impossibility of fasting it.  \n \n24.6 Not leaving the masjid  \n \n24.6a Only to go to the lavatory  \n \nPeople doing I’tikaf should not leave the masjid except for \nnormal needs \n  \nIt is all that compels him to leave: urine, feces, the ghusl for \nJumu'a, the „Id, wudu', ghusl for janaba, eating and drinking \nprovided that he does not go beyond the near place to the further \nplace. Otherwise, his I‟tikaf is invalidated. Another precondition \nthat he does not engage in conversation with anyone. Otherwise \nhis I‟tikaf is invalidated. Then he clarifies the time in which I‟tikaf \nbegins :  \n \n24.6b When you enter the masjid  \n \nYou should enter the masjid where you are intending to do \nyour I’tikaf before sunset on the night you intend to start \n  \nThis is recommended. Compare it with what is in the two Sahih \ncollections of the hadith of 'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha). She said, \n\"When the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) wanted to do I‟tikaf, \nhe prayed Fajr and then entered into his I‟tikaf.\" The answer is \nthat he (alaihi salat wa salam) entered at the beginning of the \ntime. He isolated himself in the place in which he intended to do \nI‟tikaf after Subh. What meant by his place of I‟tikaf is the tent \n'A'isha (rahmatullahi alaihi) had set up for him, and he prayed \nSubh and then entered it.  \n \n24.7 What to avoid in I’tikaf  \n \nWhile in I’tikaf you should not visit the sick, follow funeral \nprocessions or go out to transact any business \n  \n24.7a Visiting the sick  \n \nWhile someone is in I‟tikaf, he is forbidden to visit the sick, as long \nas it is not one of his parents or both of them. In such a case, he is \nobliged to go out to show filial devotion since it is an obligation in \nthe Shari‟ah and his I‟tikaf is invalidated.  \n \n24.7b Funerals  \n \nHe is not permitted to come out for the funeral prayer of both his \nparents. If he goes out, his I‟tikaf is invalidated. He must go out to \nthe funeral prayer for one of them since not going out is \ndisobeying the living. That is not the case when they are both \ndead. His I‟tikaf is invalidated. This applies to his parents, even if \nthey are unbelievers. He does not join the funeral prayer, even if it \nis placed adjacent to him, and if it is the funeral or a neighbor or \nrighteous person. But if he does visit a sick person in the masjid or \nprays in a funeral prayer in it, his I‟tikaf is not invalidated.  \n \n24.7c Business  \n \nAs for business, Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked, \n\"Do his words, \"does not go out to transact business\" mean the \nusual going out because business takes in the markets and so it is \nprohibited to trade in the masjid or outside it, or do we say that he \ndoes not go out in the usual way and so it is permitted to trade \ninside the masjid? What is preferred is the first probability which \ncoincides with what Shaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said: \n\"If he makes a contract on a sale inside the masjid, his I‟tikaf is \nnot invalidated.\" That is the case if the transaction is put in front \nof him. If he exceeds that, then his I‟tikaf is invalidated unless it \nis through a broker and so it is prohibited without dispute. If it is \nwithout a broker and it is something slight, it is permitted without \ndislike. If it is a lot, it is disliked, but it does not invalidate the \nI‟tikaf in two aspects, i.e. whether by a broker or not, as the sale is \nnot invalid without disagreement i.e. whether it is forbidden or \ndisliked. That is not imagined in the form of permission. He is \npermitted to go out for other than trade for what he cannot \ndispense with, even if he goes far outside, as long as he does not \npass a closer place where he can buy, but with the precondition \nthat he does not find anyone to sell to him.  \n \n24.7d No preconditions  \n \nYou cannot make your I’tikaf conditional in any way \n  \nIt is not permitted to stipulate a condition in it. Its literal meaning \nit is forbidden, as \"I will do I‟tikaf for ten days. If I think I should \nleave, then I will leave,\" or he says, \"I will do I‟tikaf for the days \nrather than the nights,\" or the reverse. It is like that if he makes a \nprecondition that if something occurs to him which obliges him to \nmake it up, he will have to make it up. There is no difference in \nthat between making a precondition before beginning it or \nafterwards. If any of that occurs, the precondition is invalid and \nthe I‟tikaf is valid.  \n \n24.8 Lack of impediments  \n \n24.8a The Imam can do it  \n \nThere is no harm in the Imam of a masjid doing I’tikaf \n  \nBut it is better if he leaves it, meaning it is disliked for the Imam \nof the masjid. Or he indicates someone who says that the Imam of \nthe masjid cannot do it. Shaikh ibn Waddah (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated from Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he did not \npermit the person in I‟tikaf to act as Imam of the obligatory or \nnafila prayers. It is permitted that he be the Imam of the masjid \nwith an equal balance on each side according to what Shaikh ibn \nNaji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, or it is recommended that he be \nthe regular Imam. It is relied upon. He reported the permission \nwithout \nhis \naim \nbeing \nrefutation. \nShaikh \nAbu \n'Imran \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that it is permitted. There is a text \nin the Mukhtasar that he is disliked it for the regular Imam. You \nthat it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \ndid I‟tikaf while he (alaihi salat wa salam) was the Imam. It is not \nconcealed from you that it weakens what is in the Mukhtasar and \nwhat is relied on is the recommendation which is in agreement \nwith the hadith.  \n \n24.8b Marriage  \n \nIt is permissible for someone in I’tikaf to get married and \nfor him to officiate at someone else's marriage \n  \nIt is qualified in the Mudawwana that he does it while he is in \nplace. If it is elsewhere, it is disliked if it is in the masjid and \nforbidden if it is outside of the masjid and then his I‟tikaf is \ninvalidated. It is also qualified by it not taking up a lot of his time. \nOtherwise it is disliked, whether he is the husband or the \nguardian. If it is said that the one in ihram is forbidden to \ncontract a marriage, so what is the difference between him and \nthe one in I‟tikaf since they are both involved in a form of worship \nin which intercourse is forbidden, there are various answers, one \nof which is that the basic position is the permissibility of marriage \nfor everyone. The person in ihram is removed from this by the \nstatement of the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) that the \nperson in ihram does not marry or give in marriage. The rest \nremands on its original basis which is permissibility.  \n \n24.9 Leaving I’tikaf  \n \n24.9a When he leaves outside of Ramadan  \n \nIf you go into I’tikaf at the beginning of the month or in the \nmiddle of the month, when you leave from your I’tikaf you \nshould do so after the Maghrib of its last day \n  \nThis is any month outside of Ramadan. He is permitted to leave \nhis I‟tikaf after Maghrib without dispute in the school. This is \noutside of Ramadan.  \n \n24.9b When he leaves in Ramadan  \n \nHowever, if the period of your I’tikaf continues until the \nday of the ‘Id al-Fitr then you should spend the night \nbefore the ‘Id in the masjid and leave from it in the \nmorning to go to the place where the ‘Id prayer is going to \nbe held \n  \nIf his I‟tikaf is in Ramadan, then the end is sunset on the day of \nthe „Id al-Fitr and so he is recommended to spend that night in the \nmasjid until morning and go to the place of prayer since that is \nwhat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did, i.e. he connects \none act of worship to another.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Five: On the zakat of money, \ncrops, livestock and what comes out of mines; \njizya and what should be taken from Dhimmî \nmerchants and merchants who come from the \nDar al-Harb \n \n \nIn this chapter he also mentions mines and the zakat on \nmerchandise. Linguistically zakat means growth and increase and \nit is used for the increase in crops and property. In the Shari‟ah it \nis a term used to designate the amount of money or goods taken \nfrom specific property when it reaches a specific amount at a \nspecific time which must be spent in specific categories with \nspecific ways. It is called zakat because the one who gives it grows \nby doing it with Allah azza wa jall, i.e. his rank with Him is raised \nby that. It is attested to by the words of the Almighty, \"Take \nsadaqa from their wealth to purify and cleanse them\" (Holy \nQur‟an 9:103)  \n \n25.1 Its Ruling  \n \nIt is obligatory to pay zakat on money, crops and livestock \n  \nMoney consists gold and silver and is mentioned in respect to the \ntradition. What is mentioned of gold and silver is called \"specie\" \n('ayn) by its honor. Crops consists of food groups used for life in \ngeneral. Livestock refers to camels, cattle, and sheep and goats.  \n \nZakat became an obligation in the second year of Hijra. The \nevidence for its obligatory nature is the Book, sunnah and \nconsensus. Whoever disputes its obligatory nature is an \nunbeliever. If someone affirms that it is obligatory but refuses to \npay it, he is beaten and it is taken from him by force and that is \nenough: he is not an unbeliever. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says he is an unbeliever, but this is unlikely. There are \npreconditions for the obligation and preconditions for the validity. \nAs for the first, they are seven in general because Islam is one of \nthe preconditions of the obligation since the unbelievers are not \nresponsible for the rulings of the Shari‟ah. The soundest position \nis that they are addressed to them, and so Islam is a precondition \nfor its validity.  \n \n25.2 Its preconditions  \n \nThe preconditions of the obligation are:  \n \nIslam,  \n \nFreedom,  \n \nThe nisab,  \n \nOwnership,  \n \nA year for other than treasure-trove and tenths,  \n \nLack of debt in money,  \n \nThe coming of the collector to the herds if there are collectors and \nthey can reach them.  \n \nThe preconditions for its validity are four:  \n \nIntention,  \n \nIts distribution in the place of its obligation,  \n \nPaying it after it is becomes obligatory,  \n \nPaying it to a just Imam to take it and spend it if he exists or to its \npeople, who are the eight classes indicated by the words which are \nindicated by the words of the Almighty: \"Sadaqa are for the poor \nand the needy\" (Holy Qur‟an 9:60)  \n \n25.3 The time of the obligation  \n \n25.3a On crops  \n \nZakat on crops must be paid on the day they are harvested \n  \nThere are two statements about grains and three about fruits. The \nfirst is by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) who says that when \nthe palms are appraised, the grapes are good, the olives are black \nor near to it, the crop was begun to ripen and does not need water, \nthen zakat is due on it . Shaikh ibn 'Abd as-Salam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that it is the well-known position. The second is by \nShaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is only obliged \non crops when they are harvested and only obliged on dates when \nthey are cut. His evidence is the words of the Almighty, \"Render \nthe dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 6:141) This is the meaning \"harvest and cutting\". \nThe third is particular to dates which is that they are only obliged \nby estimation, which is made by Shaikh al-Mughira (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). There is an order to these things: first soundness, then \nestimation and then cutting; and ripening is first and then \nharvest.  \n \n25.3b On money and livestock  \n \nZakat on money and livestock is paid once a year \n  \nMoney is other than mines and treasure-trove. Zakat is obliged on \nmoney and livestock once a year, after the end of a full year. \nShaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The precondition of \nlivestock after a year is that the collector comes in the well-known \nposition if he exists and arrives. Otherwise it is obliged after the \nyear by agreement. According to the well-known position, if it is \npaid before he comes, then it does not satisfy the requirement.  \n \n25.4 On farm produce  \n \n25.4a The minimum amount  \n \nNo zakat is due on any amount of dates or grain less than \nfive wasqs \n  \nSince it is sound that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"No zakat is due on grain or fruit until it reaches five wasqs.\" \n(Sahih Muslim) Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"See whether legumes are included with grain, raisins and olives \nwith fruits or not. Some commentaries include it in grain and \nmake grain include other things than fruits. There are 19 types: \nwheat, barley, sult-barley, rice, millet, sorghum, and Arabian \nwheat, and seven legumes: lentils, beans, broad beans, chick-peas, \nlupines, peas, grass peas, and oil seeds, which are the seeds of red \nradishes, sesame designated as sesame and cartham (safflower), \nand olives and raisins. So there are twenty types of fruits. No \nzakat is obliged on others like cotton seeds or rape and the like.  \n \nThey mentioned two rules for the five wasqs: one is by measure \nand the other by weight.  \n \n25.4b What the measure of the wasq is  \n \nFive wasqs is the same as six and a fourth qafizes. (609.84 \nkg.) One wasq is sixty sa'as measuring by the sa'a of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). One sa'a is four mudds \n  \nWasq linguistically is joining one thing to another. The Almighty \nsays, \"and the night and all it shrouds (wasaqa),\" (Holy Qur‟an \n84:17) i.e. joins and gathers the darkness and the stars. It is 60 \nsa's by the sa' of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). So he \nstates that the nisab in the year is 747 mudds with the mudd of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Then he goes on to \nexplain the categories which are joined together and when they \nform the nisab, there is zakat due, and the types which are not \njoined since not all of the categories are combined to reach the \nnisab.  \n \n25.4c The case of certain grains  \n \nWheat, barley and sult barley are considered as one category for \nzakat purposes  \n \nWheat, barley and sult barley are combined as a single category of \ngrain as is stated in the School. They are also a single category in \nsales according to the well-known position and so disparity in \nselling one for the other is forbidden. They are combined when \nthey are cultivated and harvested in the same year. When they \nare cultivated in two or more years, it is said that one considers \nwhat is grown at the same time and they are added to each \nanother, and what is grown at one time is not added to what is \ngrown at another time. It is said that what is considered is the \ncrop. If he plants the second before harvesting the first, it is added \nto it. Otherwise it is not. The first is from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) in the book of Shaikh ibn Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and the second by Shaikh ibn Maslama \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n25.4d When zakat is due on them  \n \nso that if together they add up to five wasqs you have to \npay zakat on them \n  \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that he pays from \neach grain what is representative of it and so he pays the highest \nfrom the highest, the lowest from the lowest, and the middle from \nthe middle. If he chooses to pay the highest grain for the lowest, \nthat is allowed. If he pays the lowest for the highest, that is not \nallowed. So there is agreement regarding grains that he pays from \nevery type what is representative of it. There is agreement \nregarding animals that he pays the middle. There is disagreement \nabout dates: it is said that they are like livestock, and it is said \nlike grains.  \n \n25.4e Pulses are combined  \n \nIn the same way different kinds of pulses are added \ntogether  \n \nThe Maliki School considers that pulses are considered as a single \ncategory for zakat, but not for selling. Pulses includes various \ntypes: peas, chickpeas, lentils, grass peas, broad beans, lupines, \nbeans and sesame seeds. The commentator on the Muwatta' said \nthat radish seeds are included with them.  \n \n25.4f Dates and raisins  \n \nand this also applies to different varieties of dates and \nraisins \n  \nThe same is for dates and raisins when they reach five wasqs.  \n \n25.4g Rice, sorghum and millet are different categories  \n \nHowever rice, sorghum and millet are each considered to \nbe in a different category and are not added together when \ncalculating zakat \n  \nEach of these are a separate category and according to the School \nthey are not added together because they are clearly separate and \ntheir form differs. He says this is in reference to zakat to indicate \nthe person who says that they are all one category in usury, i.e. \ndisparity is not allowed between them. That is the position of \nShaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi). The well-known position \ndiffers from that.  \n \n25.4h What is done with the various types of dates  \n \nIf there are various types of dates in a date-garden you use the \nmiddle quality when paying zakat.  \n \nSo they are good, middle and poor. In the well-known position, the \nmiddle variety are used. If there is one type, it is taken from it, be \nit is good or poor. He does not have to bring the middle or the best \nof it. If there is both excellent and poor, he takes each from its \nshare, even if the poor is few, because the basis is that zakat is \ntaken from its source by the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam): \"The zakat of every property is from it.\" The \nSunnah is makes certain requirements in livestock. So the \nSunnah is that it is paid from the generality of livestock because it \nis taken from the middle and the rest remains on its root.  \n \n25.4i Olives  \n \nYou pay zakat on olives when the amount of them reaches \nfive wasqs, paying the zakat in oil \n  \ni.e. measured in dry ones. Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays that there is no zakat on them nor in anything which has oil. \nThe sound position in the basis of the School, i.e. sound and \ncurrent according to the rule of the School is that that which is not \na foodstuff has no zakat paid on it. We read in at-Tahqiq, \"Even it \nis not a comestible, it is included in it if it is sound for food.\" \nAccording to the statement that there is zakat, its zakat is given \nfrom its oil, not from its grain in the well-known position. There is \nno precondition that oil reach the nisab in weight. The \nprecondition is the grain reaching the nisab, as was clearly stated \nby the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported the agreement on that. If it is paid \nfrom its grain, that is not allowed.]  \n \n25.4j Zakatable seeds  \n \nYou also pay zakat on sesame seeds and radish seed in oil for \nthem. If you sell this produce, it is possible to pay the zakat owed \nusing the money you have received, if Allah azza wa jall wills.  \n \nAnd other things which are pressed for oil when that reaches the \nnisab. if the olives are sold, then it is paid from the price whether \nthe price reaches the nisab or not. The nisab of the grain itself is \nonly considered, not the price. One of them said that he said, \"If \nAllah wills\" because of the weakness of this position, and some say \nthat it is because of the strength of the disagreement regarding it. \nThat which is in the Mukhtasar and its commentary is that if \nolives and their like have oil, it is paid from their oil. If they have \nno oil, like olives of Egypt, it is paid from their price. It is like that \nwith what is it not dried, like the fresh dates and grapes of Egypt \nand green broad beans. Zakat is paid from their price, even if they \nare sold for a lot less than that on which zakat is obliged if it is \nestimated to be five wasqs. If it is less than that, nothing is \nobliged on it, even if he sells it for many times more than what \nwould incur zakat.  \n \n25.4.k Fruit and vegetables  \n \nYou do not pay zakat on fruit and vegetables \n  \nLike apples and apricots, nor vegetables based on what is reported \nby Mu'adh ibn Jabal (radhi‟Allahu anhu): the Rasulullah (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"\"There is a tenth ('ushr) on land watered by \nthe sky or springs or running springs. There is half an 'ushr (5%) \non land which is irrigated,\" i.e. that which is transported from a \nriver or well to water crops by some device. That is about dates, \nwheat and grains. As for cucumbers and watermelons, they are \nexempt as the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) exempted them.  \n \n25.6 On Money  \n \n25.6a The nisab on gold  \n \nThere is no zakat on gold if you have less than twenty \ndinars. If the amount reaches twenty dinars you pay one \nhalf of a dinar, in other words, one-fortieth of the total \namount. Any more than that is calculated on the same \nbasis, however small the additional amount is \n  \n \n25.6b The nisab on silver  \n \nThere is no zakat on silver if you have less than two \nhundred dirhams, which is five uqiyyas - one uqiyya being \nforty dirhams. This is based on seven dinars being of the \nsame weight as ten dirhams. If you have two hundred such \ndirhams you pay one-fortieth, that is five dirhams. \nAnything more than that is calculated on the same basis  \n \n \nBy the legal dirham, which is the Makkan dirham. Its weight is \n555 grains of middle barley corns. Each dinar weighs 72 grains. It \nis said that it is the dirham of measure because by the legal \nmeasures.  \n \n25.6c Gold and silver are a single category  \n \nGold and silver and considered as one category for the \npurposes of zakat. So if, for example, someone has one \nhundred dirhams and ten dinars they should pay one-\nfortieth of each \n  \nSince that is what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did in \nthat. It is clarified in at-Tahqiq: \"It is related that Shaikh Bukayr \nibn 'Abdullah ibn al-Ashajj (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, 'The \nSunnah is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) joined \ngold to silver and silver to gold and took zakat from them.\" He \ngoes into a sub-category of that. The joining is by parts and not by \nvalue. The opposite would be to make each dinar equal to ten \ndirhams, even if its value is many times over, as when he has 100 \ndirhams and ten dinars, or 150 and 5 dinars. If he has 180 \ndirhams and 1 dinar equal to 20 dirhams, he does not pay \nanything. It is permitted to pay one of the two types for the other \naccording to the well-known position.  \n \n25.7 On Merchandise  \n \n25.7a Only on trading merchandise  \n \nThere is no zakat on goods unless they are for trading \npurposes \n  \nGoods comprises slaves, real estate, land, clothes, wheat, and all \ngrains, fruits and animals when they are less than the nisab. As \nfor private property, there is no zakat on it by agreement. As for \nmerchandise, there is zakat on it by agreement. As for hoarding \nwhich is what is kept from the markets for a large profit, zakat is \nobliged on it.   \n \n25.7b Preconditions  \n \nThere are preconditions for the obligation of zakat on it.  \n \n1. One of them is the intention, which is indicated by \"unless they \nare for trading purposes.\" This means he only intends them for \ncommerce, or commerce as well as private ownership, or revenue. \nHe is careful about the lack of intention so when there is an \nexchange of goods which is not intended for commerce, as when it \nis simply for ownership or just for revenue or both, then there is \nno zakat.  \n \n2. The second precondition is that he keeps the goods from the \nmarkets until a time when there is a good profit.  \n \n25.7c Sale income  \n \nIf you sell goods after one year or more from the day you \nbought them or paid zakat on their price \n  \n3. The third precondition is that he owns them by paying for them. \nThis precludes goods possessed through inheritance, gifts or the \nlike. There is no zakat on them except after a year from the day \ntheir price is received, even if he delays receiving it to avoid zakat.  \n \n4. The fourth is that he sells them for money, not that he sells \nthem at all or sells them for other than money, unless selling them \nnot for money is out of the intention to evade zakat. There is no \ndifference in selling between it being real or metaphorical in that \na person consumes the item and the merchant takes his price. \nWhat is sold must reach the nisab because stored goods are not \nevaluated as opposed to the situation where there is a constant \nturnover. So simple selling in respect of it is enough for the \nexistence of zakat, even if the price of what he sells is less than \nthe nisab because he must value the rest of his goods. This \nprecondition is taken from his words:  \n \n25.7d Length of time  \n \nthen you only have to pay one year's zakat on the proceeds \nof the goods whether these goods were in your possession \nfor one year or more than one year before you sold them \n  \nTo exclude the one who sells it for goods. He does not pay zakat.  \n \n5. The fifth precondition is that a year passes from the day the \nzakat was paid on the capital or he acquires it. He is silent about \nthe precondition, which is that the basis of those goods be money \nby which he bought them. If it is less than the nisab or was by \nbarter, even private property which he then he sells and uses to \nbuy those goods for the sake of trade. If he sells them before the \nend of the year, there is no zakat on them until the year has \npassed.  \n \nThen he moves to speaking about the merchandise which has a \nconstant turnover, which are goods which he buys for trade and \nsells without waiting not wait for a favorable market or a slack \nmarket like all owners of shops with a constant turnover. This is \nan exception to the previous statement.  \n \n25.7e The case of constant turnover  \n \nHowever, if you are a merchant with a constant turnover \nso that you never keep money or goods in your possession \nfor any length of time then you should assess your goods \nevery year and pay zakat on them and on whatever cash \nyou have in hand at that time \n  \nHe sells for current price and replaces it and does not wait for a \ngood market to sell or a slack market to buy. Then you assess your \ngoods of every category for what they are normally sold at that \ntime for a price equivalent to the common sale rather than the \nforced sale because the forced sale is at a great reduction. Brocade \nand similar cloth, like fine cotton garments, delicate cloth, and \nreal estate, are assessed in gold, and coarse garments and daily \nwear are assessed in silver. He begins the assessment, i.e. the tax \nyear, according to Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) from the \nday he begins to trade. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat it is from the day the zakat of the price is taken or from the \nday he has profit. After assessment, zakat is paid on the \nmerchandise provided some have been sold, even a dirham. There \nis no difference between selling something at the beginning or the \nend of the year. When he does not sell anything or has a sale a \nmonth after the year, for instance, he assesses it at that point, and \ntransfers his year to that month and voids the extra over the year. \nIt is like that the one who deals in money if it is with him. It is \nlike that with the zakat of his debt when it is immediately taken.  \n \n25.7f Zakat on investments  \n \nZakat is due on invested wealth when that wealth has been \nin your possession for one year \n  \nIt would literally mean whether there was a nisab or not. That is \nthe case in the well-known position. For example, he has a dinar \nwhich remains with him for 11 months. Then he buys goods with \nit which he sells after a month for 20. He pays zakat now, when he \nsells them after a month, relative or the fact that it was with him \nfor 11 months, and it becomes the second year when it is \ncompleted.  \n \nIf he enters the zakatable level in the year, he pays for the entire \nyear.  \n \n25.7g Zakat on the offspring of livestock  \n \nSimilarly zakat is due on the offspring of livestock if the \nmother animals have been in your possession for a year \n  \nThe basis for that is the statement of 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nfor them to count the lambs with their mothers but not to take \nthem. The profit is like the lambs, and lambs include the male and \nfemale young sheep and young goats at the moment which they \nare born.  \n \n25.8 Debts  \n \n25.8a Debts cancel out wealth  \n \nIf you have wealth on which zakat is due but you also have \na debt of the same amount or one which will reduce your \nwealth to less than the amount on which zakat is due then \nyou do not have to pay zakat \n  \nSo if you have 20 dirhams and owe a debt in goods, for instance, or \nfood, livestock or something else, immediate or deferred, equal to \nthe amount or one which will reduce it below the minimum on \nwhich zakat is due (as when he has 20 dirhams and owes half a \ndinar) there is no zakat in both cases. The apparent meaning of \nthe words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that the debt \ncancels zakat, even if it is the mahr of this wife who is in his care, \nand even more so if she is divorced and he owes her the mahr. It is \nthe preferred from the two well-known positions. In the other \nwell-known position, it is not canceled.  \n \nAccording to the well-known position, the debt cancels zakat, even \nthe debt of the zakat, as opposed to the debts of vows and \nexpiation‟s which do not cancel zakat. The difference is that the \ndebt of zakat is sought by the just Imam, and zakat is taken, even \nby force, which is not the case with vows and expiation‟s. Then \nthere is an exception from that generality.  \n \n25.8b If you have other assets  \n \nIf, however, you have other assets on which zakat is not \ndue such as personal effects or slaves or domestic animals \nor private property which could be used to pay off your \ndebt, then you do pay zakat on your wealth \n \nThis is when someone has wealth on which zakat is due and has a \ndebt equal to it; or one which reduces the zakatable property. If he \nhas goods like slaves, real estate, residences, garments, grains, \ndates and animals less than the nisab, or even if he has grains, \ndates or animals on which there is zakat, he puts that against the \ndebt he owes and pays zakat. Real estate means that which has no \nlintels, like open land, houses is property with a lintel like houses. \nIf the wealth on which zakat is not obliged of his personal goods is \nenough to discharge the debt, it is put opposite the debt he owes \nwith the precondition that he has had it for a year. The year of \neverything is according to it. This applies to things that can be \nsold to settle the debt.  \n \n25.8c The difference  \n \nIf your assets are not sufficient to pay your debt, then you \ncalculate the difference between the debt and your assets \nand subtract the difference from the wealth on which \nzakat is due. If there is still enough left for zakat to be due \nyou must pay the zakat \n  \nIt is assessed according to what is left. So if he has 30 dinars and \nowes 20 and has goods which could be sold for ten to settle the \ndebt and has had them for a year, ten are be taken from the 30 \nand put opposite the debt. What is meant is not actual taking and \ngiving since it is permitted to delay the term of the debt. So 20 \nremain free of the debt and zakat is paid on them.  \n \nThen he clarifies zakat which is not canceled by debt.  \n \n25.8d Debt does not affect zakat in kind  \n \nDebt does not, however, affect the obligation to pay zakat \non grain, dates or livestock \n  \nNor does it affect the zakat of mines or treasure. For instance, he \nmay have some of these things and owe a debt which would absorb \nall he has. He still must pay zakat on it and the debt does not \ncancel what is due on it. The difference between that and money is \nthat the Sunnah has come that the debt affects money. As for \nlivestock and fruits, the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nthe khalifs after him sent assessors and agents and they \nestimated for the people and took the zakat of their livestock from \nthem and did not ask whether they had a debt or not.  \n \nSimilarly the debt does not cancel Zakat al-Fitr according to \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi), and it is the preferred \nposition. According to Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) it cancels it.  \n \n25.9 If one has claim to a debt  \n \n25.9a No zakat on money owed until it is received  \n \nYou do not have to pay zakat on money which is owed to \nyou until after you have received it and if the debt has \nbeen outstanding for a number of years you only pay one \nyear's zakat on it after it is repaid \n  \nWhether it is money or goods, until he receives it, meaning the \nloan and unpaid sales when it is hoarded. An example of that is \nwhen he has some money and lends it to a man or buys goods with \nit and then sells it with a debt. It does not matter how many years \npass: the zakat of its owner is due one year after it received if it is \nthe minimum or is added to money he has and it reaches the \nminimum. It is evident he pays for just one year, even if he delays \nit to evade zakat. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat if he leaves it to evade zakat, then he pays for the past years.  \n \n25.9b The case of goods sold  \n \nThis is the same as when you own goods. You only pay \nzakat on them after you have sold them \n  \nThese are goods stored up for trade. They are the same as the debt \nsince their source is money. He pays zakat for one year even if \nthey remain for many years.  \n \n25.9c Claims which are inherited  \n \nIf the debt owing to you on the goods has been inherited by \nyou, you wait for one year after receiving payment before \npaying the zakat due \n  \nIf there is an inheritance which he does not receive for some years, \nor the goods which he sells are from inheritance, i.e. he inherited \ngoods and sells them but does not receive that price for some \nyears, or the debt is from a gift or sadaqa in the possession of the \ngiver or a bride-price in the hand of the husband or khul' which he \npays, or the fine of a tort in the hand of the perpetuator or his \nguardian, there is no zakat on it except after a year from when he \ntakes it, even if he delays it out of avoidance. If the gift remains in \nthe possession of its giver before giving and taking for two years, \nthere is no zakat on it for previous years from either the giver or \nreceiver according to Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nbecause the ownership is clear when the recipient takes it on the \nday of the sadaqa and that is why he had its proceeds from the \nday it is given.  \n \n25.10 Minors and slaves  \n \n25.10a Minors  \n \nZakat must be paid on wealth belonging to minors whether \nit is in the form of money, crops or livestock \n  \nBased on what is in the Muwatta' from Shaikh Abdu'r-Rahman \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) from his father. He said, \n\"'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) used to look after me and one of my \nbrothers in her house. We were orphans. She used to pay the \nzakat from our property.\" (Al-Muwatta 17.6.13) In it 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Trade with the property of orphans and \nthen it will not be eaten away by zakat.\" (Al-Muwatta 17.6.12) The \nlike of this is not stated out of opinion. The guardian of orphans \ndoes not pay zakat for them until the matter has been presented \nto the Imam or Qadi. The gist of the fiqh of the question is that \nwhat is considered is the school of the trustee because disposal \ndepends on him and not on the school of the father of the children \nsince he is dead and the property has moved on from him, nor the \nschool of the child because he is not responsible for it. So the \ntrustee does not pay its zakat if his school is that it is canceled for \nthe child. Zakat is also paid on the property of the insane.  \n \n25.10b Zakat al-Fitr of Minors  \n \nZakat al-fitr must also be paid on their behalf \n  \n25.10c Slaves  \n \nSlaves, including those who are partially but not completely freed, \ndo not have to pay zakat on any of these categories.  \n \nSlaves of any category do not pat zakat. That applies to all the \ncategories and to zakat al-Fitr.  \n \n25.10d After slaves are free  \n \nIf they have been completely freed they do not pay zakat on any \nwealth in their possession until a whole year has passed from the \nday when they were freed. \n  \nIt is a precondition that they own it for a year: cash or livestock.  \n \n25.11 Property for personal use  \n \n25.11a No zakat on personal property  \n \nNo zakat is payable on slaves, servants, horses, your house \nnor on any private property or goods which are for your \nown personal use nor on jewelry which in regular use \n  \nThere is no zakat on such property as indicated by the hadith in \nthe two Sahih collections where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"There is no zakat owed by the Muslim on his slaves \nor horses.\" It is not due on jewelry which is worn by women even if \nit belongs to a man. From this it might be assumed that jewelry \nwhich is rented must have zakat paid on it. The evident text of the \nMudawwana is that there is no zakat, and that is the accepted \nposition. As for jewelry for the purpose of trade, there is zakat on \nit by consensus whether it belongs to a man or a woman, and its \nzakat is a year from the time when it is intended to trade in it. It \nis weighed every year and if it reaches the minimum, or he has \ngold and silver which will complete the nisab.  \n \n25.11b Inheriting that on which zakat has been paid  \n \nIf you inherit or are given any goods or take any produce, \non which zakat has already been paid, from your land and \nthen sell any of these things, no zakat is due on the \nproceeds until a year has elapsed \n  \nThe literal meaning of 'selling' is whether it is sold for money or on \ncredit, and its literal meaning is also whether or not he leaves it to \navoid zakat. 'Produce' is what is normally produced since its \njudgment is the same when it comes from land which is not his, as \nwhen he rents land and grows crops in it. So he pays zakat on it \nwhen the crop is produced, and it is like that if he did not pay \nzakat on it on.   \n \n25.12 Mines  \n \n25.12a The zakat on mines  \n \nZakat is due on gold or silver extracted from mines as soon \nas the weight of gold amounts to twenty dinars or the \nweight of silver to five uqiyyas. One-fortieth must be paid \non the day it is extracted \n  \nBy his literal words, this would apply to nuggets found without \nmining or with little work. The famous well-known is that there is \na fifth on mines and that fifth is paid to the Imam if he is just. \nOtherwise it is distributed to the poor Muslims. There is no zakat \non mined things other than gold and silver - like lead, copper, iron, \nand arsenic. This zakat is due when it reaches the minimum \nweight. One-fortieth is due on that, not a fifth by the generality of \nthe statement of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"And \nthere is no zakat on what is less than 5 awqiyyas.\" This implies \nthat when there is five awqiyyas, there is zakat on it, and that \nincludes ore. It is due the day it is extracted and the year is not a \nprecondition for it. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) means the year is not a \nprecondition and he means after it is extracted because the \nobligation is only connected to it after it is extracted. It is one of \ntwo statements. The famous one is how Shaikh al-Aqfashasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) applied the Risala as meaning after \nextraction. So the obligation is connected to its mining and not its \nextraction.  \n \n25.12b Further payment of zakat  \n \nAfter this zakat is due on all gold and silver continuously \nextracted from the same deposit, however small the \namount until such time as that deposit has been worked \ndry. If work is begun on another deposit, no zakat is due \nuntil the amount extracted reaches the amount on which \nzakat is due \n  \nThis continuity is probably in obtaining and or work or in both \ntogether, and so there are three possibilities, and he prefers the \nfirst. When he begins a new work, then there is no zakat until the \nnisab is reached as was the first case.  \n \n25.13 Jizya  \n \n25.13a Who pays jizya  \n \nJizya is taken from the men of the people of dhimma status \nprovided that they are both free and adult. It is not taken \nfrom their women, their children, or their slaves \n  \nShaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) defines it thus: what is \ntaken from the people of disbelief in repayment for their security \nand sparing their lives while they remain unbelievers. It is \nderived from jaza' (repayment) which is exchange, because they \nreceive security in exchange for the money they pay. We offer \nthem security and they offer money. It is not taken from three \ncategories: women, children and slaves because Allah azza wa jall \nhas obliged it on those who can fight, and generally that is men \nrather than women and children.  \n \n25.13b Its Preconditions  \n \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi)  implies that there are four \npreconditions for paying jizya: male, adulthood, freedom and \ndisbelief. There is also a precondition that he mix socially with the \npeople of his deen. Jizya is not taken from someone alone in a \nmonastery or hermitage. It is a precondition that the unbeliever \nremain an unbeliever. It is not taken from the apostate because he \nis not confirmed in his disbelief. Sanity and the ability to pay it \nare two preconditions. It is not taken from the madman nor from \nthe pauper who has nothing.  \n \n25.13c Magians and Christian Arabs  \n \nIt is taken from Magians and from Christian Arabs \n  \nShaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it applies to \nboth Arabs and non-Arabs. He means universality by that to \nrefute the one who opposes that.  \n \n25.13d Its amount  \n \nFor people who use gold the jizya is four dinars and for \npeople who use silver it is forty dirhams \n  \nThis applies to people conquered by force who are people of the \nunbelievers whose lands have taken by force. It is like that for the \npeople of truce who are unbelievers who protected their land by \nmaking peace in exchange for something which they paid of their \nproperty. If something particular is determined from them, it is \ntaken, be it little or a lot.  \n \n25.13e Its reduction  \n \nIt can be made less for people who are poor \n  \nIt can be lessened for the poor according to what the Imam relates. \nIf someone does not have the ability to pay something, it is \ncanceled for him. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nit is not taken from the poor and Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi)  recommended that.  \n \n25.13f Impost on trading goods  \n \nThose among them who are engaged in long-distance \ntrading should pay one tenth of what they receive when \nthey sell their goods even if they come and go several times \nin on year \n  \nMeaning the people of dhimma, men or women, free or slaves, or \nchildren. It is from a place where jizya is not paid to one where \njizya is paid. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is a \ntenth of the sale price. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid it is a tenth of what they bring, like the harbis. According to \nthe position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), if they \nwant to return before they buy or sell, it is not due from them. It is \nthe evident meaning of the words here. According to the position \nof Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi), it is obliged on them. \nThe source of the dispute is whether what is taken from them is \nconnected to benefit or to arrival in the region. It is understood \nfrom the words that the tenth is not taken from them when they \ntrade in their land, and that is the case. Then he continues about \na tenth of the price which is taken even if they come and go \nseveral times in the year. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) say that it is only \ntaken from them once a year. We have what 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) did. The use and judgment are repeated when the cause is \nrepeated.  \n \n25.13g Food for Makka or Madina  \n \nIf they are carrying food destined specifically for Makka or \nMadina only one-twentieth of what they sell it for should \nbe taken \n  \nIf the people of the dhimma carry food, meaning wheat and oil, or \nit is said that it means all food products. As for things other than \nfood, like goods, the full tenth is taken from their price.  \n \n25.13h Harbi traders paying a tenth  \n \nA tenth is also levied from traders who come from Dar al-\nHarb (the land of war - beyond the frontiers of Islam)  \n \nThis is on what they bring whether they sell or not, and whether \nthey sell in one land or all of the lands of Islam. It is the position \nof Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). His position was \ngiven about the people of dhimma that it is not taken from them \nuntil there is a sale. There is a difference between them is that the \npeople of harb obtain security while they are in the land of Islam, \nand all lands of Islam are like one land. As for the people of \ndhimma, it is taken from them by their benefit and they are not \nforbidden our lands. So when their benefit is repeated, taking \nfrom them is repeated. The apparent meaning of the words of the \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that the tenth is not decreased, \neven if the Imam thinks that should be done. That is that position \nof Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). In short, if it before alighting, an agreement \ncan be made with them for more than a tenth. If it is after they \ncamp, only a tenth is taken from them. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It is taken from them according to the \nopinion of the ruler.\" There may be stipulation for more than that \nwhen a safe conduct has been previously agreed.  \n \n25.13i When other terms have been agreed  \n \nunless they have agreed to terms demanding more than \nthat \n  \nIt is permitted to take the greater amount which is stipulated. \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said: they cannot sell wine \nto a Muslim by agreement. The well-known position is that they \nare able to sell it to others. There is the text of the words of \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \"When they bring wine \nand pigs and there are people of dhimma who buy that from them, \nthey are left, and the tenth is taken from them after selling. If \nthere is no one there to buy that from them, they return with it \nand are not allowed to import it.  \n \n25.14 Treasure-trove  \n \n25.14a What treasure-trove is  \n \nIf someone comes upon treasure (rikaz) that was buried in \nthe time of the Jahiliyya (before Islam)  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) added in al-Wadiha that it \nis (rikaz) in particular. Kanz is applied to what was buried in the \nJahiliyya and buried in Islam. There is disagreement about \nwhether it is particular to gold and silver or general, including \nother things like pearls, copper and lead. There are two positions \nreported by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). The author of the \nMukhtasar confines himself to the second, and says that it is \napplied to treasure-trove. If he doubts whether it is jahili or not, \nthen the signs are studied. If there are none, that was mostly done \nby them. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is known \nto be part of the school which Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \npreferred it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported \nthat it is particular to gold and silver and its judgment is obliged \non it.  \n \n25.14b What is paid on it  \n \nhe must pay the fifth \n  \nThe apparent meaning would be even if it is less than the \nminimum, and this is the case in the well-known position because \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  said, \"There is a fifth on \ntreasure\" and that is general to a lot and a little. It is also clear \nthat Islam and freedom are not preconditions. It also appears that \nthere is a fifth in it, even if it is found by a lot of expense or work \nin extracting it. There is zakat on it according to what is in the \nMudawwana and Muwatta'.  \n \nIt also appears that it is absolutely belongs to the one who finds it. \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  affirmed that, but that is \nnot always the case. If it is found in the wilds of the land of Islam, \nit belongs to its finder. If he finds in it in someone's property, then \nit is his by agreement. This is the judgment of treasure.  \n \nAs for what the sea throws up to the shore, like amber, pearls and \nother jewelry which he finds, they belong to the one who finds \nthem and there is no fifth. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said unless prior protected ownership is proven by a \nMuslim or Dhimmî. There are two statements: Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) heard that someone who discards his \ngoods out of fear of drowning takes them from the one who \nappropriated them. It is like that what he leaves due to \nconstriction and is unable to take. There are two positions.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty Six: On the Zakat of Livestock \n \n \n26.1. Its judgment  \n \nZakat on camels, cows, sheep and goats is obligatory \n  \nZakat is obliged on what was mentioned. That is stated by Malikis \nsince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no \nzakat owed by a Muslim on his horses or slaves.\" The apparent \nwords of the author is that zakat is obliged on livestock absolutely, \nfoddered or work animals. It is the School. According to Imam Abu \nHanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam ash-Shafi‟i(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), there is no zakat on work animals since he said, \"There is \nzakat on grazing sheep.\" He begins with the obligation of zakat on \ncamels to follow the hadith since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did that in the letter on zakat written for Amr ibn Hazm \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu). There are 11 obligations in its zakat, four of \nwhich are taken from a different species, sheep, and seven which \nare taken from camels.  \n \n26.2 On Camels  \n \n26.2a Five to nine camels  \n \nThere is no zakat on less than five camels but on five to \nnine camels you must give either a sheep or a goat which is \nin its second year depending on which of the two animals \nis most commonly kept by the people of the area \n  \nWhen it reaches this number, one owes a sheep which has been \nalive for one year and begun the next. There is no difference \nbetween the male and female sheep or goat. The judgment is \nbased on what is common. If it is sheep, it is taken from sheep. If \nit is goats, it is taken from them. If the owner of the property gives \na camel instead of the obliged sheep, it is permissible because it is \nof the same type of property and is worth more than is what is \nobliged of him. The limit for a single sheep is nine. So the shortfall \n(waqs) is four, which is the smallest waqs.  \n \n26.2b Ten to twenty-five  \n \nYou must give two sheep or goats for ten to fourteen \ncamels and three sheep or goats for fifteen to nineteen \ncamels. For twenty to twenty-five camels you must give \nfour sheep or goats \n  \nThe shortfall in each of these categories are four.  \n \n26.2c Twenty-five to thirty-five  \n \nFor twenty-five to thirty-five camels you must give a \nfemale camel in its second year (bint makhad) or if there is \nnot one available a male camel in its third year (ibn labun) \n  \nIt appears that it has completed two years, and elsewhere it states \nthat it has begun the second year. It is called bint makhad \nbecause its mother has given birth because the camel is pregnant \nfor a year and cares for the young for a year. If there are none \navailable or it is damaged, then it is necessary to take a male \nwhich has completed the second year and begun the third. If there \nis neither, the collector charges him for a bint makhad, whether \nhe likes it or not, and then makes the judgment of the absence of \nboth of them like that of their existence. Then he comes with a ibn \nlabun at that point, it is up to the collector to do what he thinks \nbest. If he thinks it right, he takes it. Otherwise he obliges him \nthe bint makhad.  \n \n26.2d Thirty-six to forty-five  \n \nFor thirty-six to forty-five camels you must give a female \ncamel aged between two and five years (bint labun) \n  \nThe shortfall in this is ten. What is meant is not having lived \nthree full years, but what has two full years and begun the third. \nThe shortfall at the end is nine.  \n \n26.2e Forty-six to sixty  \n \nFor forty-six to sixty camels you must give a female camel \nin its fourth year capable of carrying loads and bearing \nchildren (hiqqa) \n  \nIf he pays it with two bint labuns, that does not satisfy it, even if \nthey are equal in their value to its value as opposed to the view \nImam ash-Shafi‟i(rahmatullahi alaihi). What is meant is what has \ncompleted its third year and begun its fourth. The shortfall in this \nobligation is 14.  \n \n26.2f Sixty-one to seventy-five  \n \nFor sixty-one to seventy-five camels you must give a female \ncamel in its fifth year (jadh'a) \n  \nThen after this the obligation changes. What is meant is one \nwhich has completed its fourth year and begun the fifth. It is the \nlast of the categories taken for paying the zakat of camels. The \nshortfall is fourteen.  \n \n26.2g Seventy-six to ninety \n  \nFor seventy-six to ninety camels you must give two female \ncamels in their third year (bint labun)  \n \nThe shortfall is fourteen.  \n \n26.2h Ninety-one to 120  \n \nFor ninety-one to one hundred and twenty camels you \nmust give two hiqqas  \n \nThe shortfall is twenty-nine.   \n \n26.2i More than 120  \n \nFor any more than this you give one hiqqa for every fifty \ncamels and one bint labun for every forty \n  \nFor more than one hundred twenty, the obligation is this.  \n \n26.3 Zakat on cattle  \n \n26.3a The nisab  \n \nThere is no zakat on less than thirty cattle \n  \nIts nisab is thirty. Forty and more are subject.  \n \n26.3b Thirty to forty  \n \nIf there are thirty you must give one in its third year (tabi') \n  \nThirty to forty  have a calf in its third year, which is called that \nbecause it follows its mother. It is would appear from the words \nthat it is a precondition that it be male, but that is not the case. \nThe well-known position is that it is not a precondition. It must \nhave completed two years.  \n \n26.3c Forty  \n \nThis applies up to forty. If there are forty you must give a \ncow in its fourth year (musinna or thaniyya) - only females \nare acceptable \n  \nWhen the number reaches forty, the obligation changes. One owes \na cow in the fourth year, and it is only taken in females. If there is \nno four year old cow, its owner is compelled to bring it unless he \ngives better than it, which is a five year cow. The musinna has full \nfour years according to Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n26.3d Third nisab: More than forty  \n \nIf there are more than that you must give a musinna for \nevery forty and a tabi' for every thirty  \n \nIf there are five more than forty, there is nothing on it. If it \nreaches fifty, there is nothing on the ten in our view. When it \nreaches sixty, there are two tabi' on them. If it reaches seventy, \nthere is a tabi' and a musinna. If it reaches eighty, there are two \nmusinna. What is more goes according to its rule.  \n \n26.4 Zakat on sheep and goats  \n \n26.4a Nisab and up to one hundred twenty  \n \nThere is no zakat on sheep and goats until their number \nreaches forty. If you pass forty you must give one in its \nfifth year (jadh'a) or one in its fourth year (thaniyya). This \napplies up to one hundred and twenty animals \n  \nNeither male or female is specified. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that it was clarified in the nisab of \ncamels.  \n \n26.4b Second nisab: one hundred twenty to two hundred  \n \nIf you have between one hundred and twenty and two \nhundred sheep and/or goats you must give two \n  \nSo the shortfall is eighty. Then he indicates the second obligation \nand its shortfall here is seventy-nine.  \n \n26.4c Third nisab: two hundred  to three hundred \n \nFor two hundred and one to three hundred you must give \nthree and for every additional hundred you give one \nanimal \n  \nHe said in al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi), in what is more than \nthree hundred, there is a sheep for every one hundred. For three \nhundred ninety-nine there are three sheep and for four hundred \nthere are four sheep and for five hundred there are five sheep and \nso forth.  \n \n26.5 Computation of zakat on animals  \n \n26.5a No zakat on shortfalls  \n \nZakat is not required on any number of animals between \nthe figures mentioned and this ruling applies to all the \ntypes of animals mentioned above \n  \nThen he explains the judgment of the shortfall between the \nobligations, saying that there is no zakat on the shortfalls. The \nshortfall is what falls short of the nisab. It is a technical term for \nall the types of livestock.  \n \n26.5b Sheep and goats are one category  \n \nSheep and goats are considered as one category for zakat \npurposes  \n \nThis is by consensus. That is what he said in at-Tahqiq because \nthe name of the species includes both of them in the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). So there is a sheep for every \nforty goats.  \n \n26.5c Cattle and buffaloes are one category  \n \nas are cattle and buffaloes  \n \nThis is by agreement because the generic name includes them all, \nas the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is a tabi' \nin every thirty.  \n \n26.5d Bactrian and dromedary camels are one category  \n \nand also Bactrian and dromedary camels \n  \nThese are the camels of the people of Khurassan since camel is \nused for both of them in the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam).  \n \n26.6 The zakat of joint owners  \n \n26.6a How it is paid  \n \nThe owners of herds which are mixed together pay zakat \njointly and settle between themselves the share each must \npay \n  \nThis is according to the number of animals. That partnership on \nwhich it is obliged has the following preconditions: it is taken from \nthe two owners as it is taken from one owner in amount, age, and \ncategory as was mentioned. If each of three has forty sheep, then \none sheep is obliged, each owing a third. The example of the \nsecond is that when each has thirty six camels and then a jadh'a is \nobliged and each owes a half. The third is that one has eighty \nsheep and the other forty goats, and one sheep is obliged, two \nthirds from one and one-third from the other.  \n \nThe benefit of partnership can be lightening as when each has \nforty sheep. On their own, they would each owe one sheep, and \ntogether they owe only one sheep. It could make it heavier as \nwhen each has one hundred twenty sheep and each of them would \nonly owe one sheep, but they owe three sheep when they are \ntogether. Or it may have no benefit, as when each has one \nhundred sheep and each alone would owe one, and it is the same \ntogether. A precondition for the two owners being like one is that \neach of them has a nisab.  \n \n26.6c Settlement is according to the state of herd  \n \nWhen the zakat of the year is due, animals which were \nmixed together are not to be separated nor those which \nwere separate to be mixed out of fear of paying the zakat \n  \nThat is when the end of the year approaches. Shaikh ibn Shash \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that that is when joining or separating \nwould reduce the zakat.   \n \n26.6d If the zakat is less because of mixing  \n \nIf the zakat paid is less because the two herds were \nseparated or mixed, the herds should be restored to their \nprior condition \n  \nWhen it is done to avoid more zakat. As when two men each have \na hundred, and so they separate at the end of the year and two \nsheep are obliged. The obligation on them is three. It is the same \nfor joining: three men each has forty and they join at the end of \nthe year so that one sheep is obliged on them: the obligation on \nthem is three sheep.  \n \n26.6b Those who do not have to pay  \n \nThere is no zakat due from someone whose share does not \nreach the number subject to zakat \n  \nBecause of the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \n\"There is no zakat on less than five camels.\" They must be liable \nfor zakat (and so they are not slaves or unbelievers) and the \nanimals have the same stud, shepherd, resting place at night, \npasturage, watering-place and milking place, and the partnership \nis by friendship, not avoidance of zakat.  \n \n26.7 Prohibited forms of payment  \n \n26.7a Baby animals  \n \nA baby sheep or goat is not taken to pay zakat. However, it \nis counted in numbering the owner's flock. Baby calves or \ncamels are not taken, but they are counted in numbering \nthe herd. Similarly, exempt from being taken as zakat are \nyoung Billy goats, thin old females, pregnant females, a \nram used for stud, a sheep or goat fattened for slaughter, a \nfemale nursing its young, nor the best of a man's property \n  \nZakat is not taken from the best or worst of a man's property. One \nis to protect the rights of the wealthy and the other to protect the \nrights of poor. If the owner gives the best cheerfully, it is \npermitted. If he gives the worst, it is not acceptable. If all the \nproperty is good or bad, he is obliged the middle. If he refuses, he \nis forced to pay it. \n  \n26.7b Not taking cash or goods in lieu  \n \nFor zakat on animals, one may not collect goods or the \nprice of the animal in place of the animal. If the collector \nforces the owner into giving the price of the animal or \nsomething else, that satisfies it, Allah willing \n  \nSomething else would be like grains. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) states that paying the price voluntarily does \nnot satisfy it. But it is taken by force, then it satisfies it in the \nwell-known position.  \n \n26.7c Debts do not cancel this duty  \n \nA debt does not cancel one's obligation to pay zakat on \ngrain, fruit or animals  \n \nIt was mentioned earlier.  \n \nSUPPLEMENT about a number of important questions:  \n \n1. He must pay it with the intention of paying zakat. If he pays it \nwithout the intention of paying zakat, it does not satisfy it unless \nhe is forced, and then the intention of the forcer is enough.  \n \n2. It is not transferred from the place in which it is obliged unless \nthere is no one there to pay it to. Then it is transferred to the \nclosest place to it.  \n \n3. It is paid at the time when is obliged. If it is delayed, it is \nallowed but he commits something unlawful. \n  \n4. He pays it in its eight categories which Allah azza wa jall \nmentioned when He says, \"Collected sadaqa is for: the poor, the \ndestitute, those who collect it, bringing people's hearts together, \nfreeing slaves, those in debt, spending in the way of Allah, and \ntravelers.\" (Holy Qur‟an 9:60)  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Seven: On the Zakat al-Fitr \n \n \n27.1 Its ruling  \n \nThe zakat al-Fitr is an obligatory Sunnah which the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) made compulsory for all \nMuslims, whether old or young, male or female, free or \nslave \n  \nIt is a confirmed Sunnah. It seems that is obligatory in the School. \nThere is disagreement about the words \"the Rasulullah (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) made it compulsory\". It is said that it means he \nstipulated it and so it is Sunnah, and that does not contradict his \nwords, \"On all, whether old or young.\" The Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) uses the terms for what is less than obligatory. The \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Zakat al-Fitr after \nRamadan obligatory for the Muslims - slave or free, male or \nfemale, young or old, being a sa' of dates or a sa' of barley.\" It is \nsaid that it means that he made it compulsory. That what the \nauthor of Mukhtasar thinks.  \n \n27.2 Its amount  \n \n27.2a Its measure  \n \nIts amount is one sa'a measuring by the sa'a of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) \n \nIt is four mudds by the mudd of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). A sa'a is a measure of volume equivalent to 4 mudds. A \nmudd is the amount contained by a man's cupped hands  \n \n27.2b What it is paid in  \n \nIt should be paid in kind using the staple food of the \npeople of the region, which might be wheat or barley or \nsult barley or dates or dried cheese or raisins or millet or \nsorghum or rice. It is also said that if the staple food of the \npeople is al-'alas, which is a small grain similar to wheat, \nthat the zakat al-fitr can be paid with that \n  \nThe land where the zakat is paid, whether their food is like his \nfood or better or worse. If his food is better than their food and he \npays the zakat in it, that is allowed. If it is less valuable than \ntheir food, and he pays it with it out of avarice, then the apparent \nwords of Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) mean that it \ndoes not satisfy the requirement by agreement.  \n \nIf he pays it from other than these nine types, it is not allowed in \nthe well-known position. This is when some or all of them exist as \nfoods. If they do not exist, all or some, and other things are used \nas food, they satisfy the requirement.  \n \n27.3 Who pays the zakat of children and slaves  \n \nThe zakat al-fitr of a slave is paid by his master and that of \na young child, who has no personal wealth, by his father. A \nman has to pay the zakat of every Muslim for whose \nmaintenance he is responsible, and he should also pay for \nhis mukatab (partially freed slave) because even if he is \nnot responsible for his maintenance, the mukatab is \nnevertheless still his slave \n  \nThe father pays for the child who has no wealth. It is understood \nfrom this that he does not pay for an adult. It is not absolute: if he \nis male, adult and wealthy, he does not pay for him. If he becomes \nadult within the time it is due, he prays for him. He pays for the \nfemale, even if she is adult, until she marries. What is understood \nby \"no personal wealth\" is that if he has wealth, he does not pay \nfor him. That is the case. It is paid by Muslims, but not \nunbelievers.  \n \n27.4 When it is paid  \n \nIt is recommended to pay the zakat al-fitr at daybreak on \nthe day of the ‘Id al-Fitr \n  \nIn Muslim it reports that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nused to command that the zakat al-fitr be paid before people went \nout to the place of prayer. This is the time of recommendation and \nnot the time of obligation. There are two well-known statements \nabout that. One is that it becomes obligatory at sunset of the last \nof the day of Ramadan and ends at the rising of dawn on the day \nof the „Id. It is permitted that it be paid a day or two before the \nday of fitr. It is not canceled when its time passes because it is a \nright of the poor for which liability remains. He does not sin as \nlong as the day of Fitr still remains. If he delays it when he is able \nto pay it, he sins. He gives to a free poor Muslim. He does not give \nit to an unbeliever, nor to a wealthy man. \n  \n27.5 Other things about ‘Id al-Fitr  \n \n27.5a Breaking the fast before the prayer  \n \nOn the morning of the ‘Id al-Fitr, it is recommended to \nbreak your fast before leaving for the prayer-place, \nwhereas on the morning of the ‘Id al-Ad-ha it is \nrecommended not to do so \n  \nBreak it with anything, but it is best that it be broken with dates, \nan odd number, based on what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did. It is not recommended to break it on the morning of „Id \nal-Adha. Then it is recommended to refrain until you return from \nthe prayer so that you can eat from the sacrifice since that it what \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did.  \n \n27.5b Varying the route  \n \nOn both ‘Ids, however, it is recommended to go to the \nprayer by one route and return from it by another \n  \n \n \nChapter Twenty Eight: On Hajj and 'Umra  \n \n \n28.1 The obligation of the Hajj \n \n28.1a The meaning of hajj  \n \nEach word has a linguistic and technical meaning. Linguistically, \nhajj means to aim for something once or to do something time \nafter time or a simple intention. This usage is like the words of the \nAlmighty, \"And when We made the House a place to return to, a \nsanctuary for mankind.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:125) Its technical usage \ndesignates an act of worship which contains ihram, standing, \ntawaf, sa'y and other things.  \n \nLinguistically 'umra means to visit. Linguistically it designates an \nact of worship which has ihram, standing, tawaf, sa'y which \nbegins like the hajj.   \n \n28.1b The word Bakka  \n \nGoing on hajj to the Sacred House of Allah azza wa jall, \nsituated in Bakka \n  \n\"Bakka\" is used to honor it.  \n \n28.1c Preconditions of its obligation  \n \nis an obligation for every free adult Muslim, who is able to \nfind a way to do it, once during his lifetime \n  \n1. Ability  \n \nIt is obligatory when five preconditions are meant. He indicates \none of them: who is 'able to find a way to it', i.e. to the House of \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \n2. Islam  \n \nIslam is a precondition for the obligation. That is what Shaikh ibn \nal-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the author of the Mukhtasar \nsay. It is a precondition for its validity. According to the first, \ndisbelief is a barrier to its obligation, and according to the second, \nto its validity.  \n \n3. Freedom  \n \nThe third precondition is freedom.  \n \n4. Adulthood  \n \nThe fourth is adulthood. The precondition of adulthood is not \nconfined to the hajj.  \n \n5. Sanity  \n \nThe final precondition remains, which is sanity. The hajj is not \nobliged for someone who is insane. \n  \nHajj is obligatory for the one who is legally responsible and meets \nthe preconditions. If someone who is not legally responsible makes \nthe hajj, his hajj is valid but the obligatory hajj is not achieved for \nhim.  \n \nIts obligation is indicated by the Book, Sunnah and consensus. \nWhoever denies that it is obligatory is an unbeliever. If anyone \naffirms its obligatory nature but refuses to do it, will be called to \nreckoning by Allah azza wa jall. Hajj is obligatory on the one who \nmeets the preconditions once in his lifetime by consensus.  \n \n28.1d The meaning of \"way\"  \n \nWhat is meant by \"way\" is a safe route, sufficient provisions \nto reach Makka, sufficient strength to be able to get to \nMakka and a good state of health \n  \nThis expression covers four things:  \n1. It must be a safe route. If he fears for himself, it is agreed that \nthe obligation is canceled. If he fears for some of his property and \ninjury, it is canceled for him. If he would not be injured, it is \ncanceled for him by one statement.  \n \n2. Provisions. Apparently he only considers what will enable him \nto reach it. That is what Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid. He qualified that by saying, \"Unless he knows that if he \nremains there, he will die and he fears for himself. Then he \nconsiders what is adequate for the return journey to the nearest \nplace he can stay in it and sell to buy provisions and other things.  \n \n3. Physical ability. The third is the strength to arrive on foot or \nriding. When the blind person finds someone to guide him and \nthere is no enormous difficulty, then it is obliged for him.  \n \n4. Health. Some say it is a part of strength and some say it is a \nfourth precondition. Hajj is not obligatory for the sick person, even \nif he can find something to ride.  \n \nThe hajj has obligations, Sunnah‟s and excellent parts. The \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not clarify them. He described \nthe hajj in the actual order in which it is performed. We will, \ninsha‟Allah, point the various parts. One of the obligations is \nihram.   \n \n28.2 Ihram  \n \n28.2a Its miqats  \n \nYou should go into 'ihram' at the appropriate miqat \n  \nIt has two miqats: one in time and one in place. \n  \n1. The Miqat of time  \n \nThe miqat of time was mentioned by the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi): that is the months of Shawwal, Dhu'l-Qi'da, and all of \nDhu'l-Hijja in the famous position. It is said it is only the first ten \ndays of Dhu'l-Hijja. Disagreement arises when the Tawaf al-Ifada \nis delayed. In the famous position, sacrifice is not obliged for him \nunless it is delayed to Muharram. In the other position, it is when \nit is knowingly delayed to the 11th. The defined time is the time of \nthe hajj, including entering ihram and ending it, not only ihram \nonly. If he goes into ihram before Shawwal, that is disliked. \n  \n2. The Miqat of place  \n \nIf he goes into ihram before that, it is disliked. It is recommended \nnot to delay going into ihram because hastening to obey is better. \nIt varies according to the different states of those going into \nihram. The miqat of the Makkan is Makka. It is recommended for \nhim to go into ihram from inside the masjid. His miqat for 'umra \nand for qiran is coming out of ihram because every ihram must \ncombine being both in and out of ihram. The miqat of someone \nfrom outside Makka varies and it is one of five places with the \ndifferences of fiqh, about whether he goes into ihram for hajj or \n'umra.  \n \n28.2b Physical miqats  \n \nThe miqat for the people of Syria, Egypt and North Africa \nis Juhfa, but if they come via Madina, it is better for them \nto go into ihram at the miqat of the people of Madina \nwhich is Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The miqat of the people of Iraq is \nDhat Irq and that of the people of Yaman, Yalamlam. The \npeople of Najd go into ihram at Qarn. If any of these go via \nMadina they too should go into ihram at Dhu'l-Hulayfa \nsince they will NOT be passing their own miqat again \n  \nJuhfa is a town about seven stages from Madina and three or five \nfrom Makka. If people of these regions come via Madina, they \nadopt the miqat of the Madinans. Dhu'l-Hulayfa is about six miles \nfrom Madina. It is the furthest of the miqats from Madina. There \nis about ten stages from Makka. Iraq also includes places further \non like Iran. Dhat 'Irq is a ruined town two stages from Makka. \nYalamlam is a mountain of Tihama two stages from Makka. Qarn \nis a small mountain apart from the mountains opposite Makka \nand two stages from it. Those who make hajj by sea from the \nEgypt and the like go into ihram when they are opposite Juhfa.  \n \n28.2c How to go into ihram  \n \nWhen going into ihram you should do so straight after praying, \nwhether that prayer is fard or nafila. You start by saying, \n\"Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk, Labbayk la sharika lak inna'l-\nhamda wa ni'mata laka wa'l-mulk, la sharika lak.\" (At Your \nservice, O Allah, at Your service. At Your service, none can be \nassociated with You, at Your service. All praise and blessing is due \nto You as is the Kingdom. None can be associated with You.)  \n \nIt is Sunnah to say this. In short, the talbiyya is obligation in \nitself. So if you were to omit it, you are obliged to sacrifice. It is \nSunnah that it accompany going in ihram. \"Labbayk \" means an \nanswer after command, The answer is in response the words of the \nAlmighty, \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes\" (bala). It also \nrefers to the fact that when Nabi Ibrahim (alaihi salam) asked \npermission for people to make hajj and he called out, \"O people! \nAllah has a House so make hajj,\" they answered him from the east \nand the west of the earth and from the wombs of the women and \nthe loins of the men. Some people prefer to stop at \"mulk\" and \nstart a new sentence with \"la sharik\".  \n \n28.2d The intention  \n \nYou say this and make the intention to do Hajj or 'umra \naccording to what you are intending to do \n  \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said according to the \nposition of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) ihram begins \nby the intention and the word, i.e. the talbiya. He considers the \ntalbiya a precondition for its validity and so it has the same \nposition as the takbir al-Ihram in the prayer. Shaikh Khalil \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the reality of ihram is to enter \nwith the intention into one of the two practices with the word \nconnected to it, like the talbiya, or an action connected to it, like \nturning to the road. Ihram does not begin simply by the intention. \nThere must be the word, like the talbiyya, or an action, like \nturning to the road. One of the special qualities of the talbiyya is \nnot that it is a precondition for the validity of ihram as Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated. It revolves around the \nexistence of one of two - word or deed. It is recommended to \nconfine oneself to the talbiyya mentioned because it was the \ntalbiyya of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n28.2e Performing a ghusl  \n \nThen you should have a ghusl  \n \nEven if a woman is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth since \nit is Sunnah. This is based on what Shaikh at-Tirmidhi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported: the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) stripped for ihram and performed a ghusl before he \nassumed ihram. There is no sacrifice for omitting it either \ndeliberately or out of forgetfulness. That is also the case with the \nrest of the ghusls of the hajj. The evidence that it is Sunnah for \nthe woman in menstruation or bleeding is what comes in the \nMuwatta' that Asma' (radhi‟Allahu anha) gave birth and when \nAbu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) mentioned that to the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) he said, \"Tell her to perform a ghusl and \nthen enter ihram.\" It is recommended for the one who wants to \nassume ihram for hajj or 'umra to clip his nails, shave his private \nparts and trim his beard, but he does not shave his head since \ndishevelment is desirable. \n  \n28.2f Removing stitched clothing  \n \nand remove any clothes containing stitching before \nactually entering the state of ihram \n  \nIt is Sunnah for men to remove any stitched garments and to wear \na wrapper, cloak and sandals.  \n \n28.2g A ghusl when entering Makka  \n \nIt is also recommended to have a ghusl when you enter \nMakka \n  \nThis is for the one in ihram, who is not menstruating or in lochia. \nIt is best that it be at Dhu Tuwa since that is what the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did.  \n \n28.2h Continuing the talbiya  \n \nYou should continue to recite the talbiya (as mentioned \nabove) after all prayers, at the summit of every rise and \nevery time you rejoin your traveling companions \n  \nThe muhrim does the talbiya after the obligatory and nafila \nprayers, and at every high place and in the valleys. His 'traveling \ncompanions' are those he camps and travels with. He also says it \nwhen he wakes up from sleep. The one saying the talbiya does not \nreturn the greeting until he finishes. He is recommended to raise \nhis voice in the talbiya to a medium level. The woman should only \nbe able to hear herself. It is not disliked for a woman in \nmenstruation or lochia to say the talbiya.  \n \n28.2i Not being excessive in the talbiya  \n \nHowever, you should not go to excess in it \n  \nThis is not recommended or obligatory. Indeed, it is disliked by \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). This means doing it a lot \nconstantly so that he does not cease that. When he does not cease, \nhe is not silent so that he misses the ceremony.  \n \n28.3 Entering Makka  \n \n28.3a Stopping the talbiya and restarting it  \n \nWhen you enter Makka you stop reciting the talbiya until \nafter you have completed your tawaf and sa'y. Then you \nstart doing it again until midday on the Day of 'Arafa, if \nyou have got to the place of prayer on 'Arafa \n  \nIt is related that he stops it at the Jamra al-'Aqaba. Shaikh al-\nLakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) inclined to what is in Sahih Muslim \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) continued to do the \ntalbiya until he stoned the Jamra al-'Aqaba.  \n \n28.3b Where to enter Makka  \n \nIt is recommended to enter Makka through the pass of \nKada' in Upper Makka and to leave it by Kuda, but it does \nnot matter if you do not do this \n  \nThis is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that \nand the Companions after him (alaihi salat wa salam) did so as \nwell. It is recommended to enter it in the day since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. If someone enters before \nsunrise, he does not do tawaf. If he does tawaf, he does not pray \nuntil sunrise. Nafila prayers are lawful. When a woman arrives in \nthe day, she is recommended to delay tawaf until night. When \nsomeone leaves, it is recommended that he go by Kuda, which is \nthe bottom of Makka. There is no sin if he does not do this, \nbecause he has not omitted something obligatory.  \n \n28.3c The first thing done after entering Makka  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that all those \nentering Makka should first of all go straight to the Masjid \nal-Haram, which it is recommended to enter by the door of \nBani Shayba \n  \nAnd no where else unless it is unavoidable - like tying up one's \nmount and having a little food. Delay is bad manners. This is now \nknown as the Door of Peace. That is because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) did that. After someone enters, he should \ndo tawaf by making the intention and make for the Black Stone.  \n \n28.4 The Tawaf  \n \n28.4a Greeting the Black Stone  \n \nYou should greet the Black Stone by kissing it, if possible, \nor if you cannot then by touching it and putting your hand \nto your mouth without kissing it \n  \nIf he cannot touch it with his hand, he touches it with his stick \nand then places it to his mouth without kissing it. A stick is not \nadequate when the hand is possible and nor the hand when \nkissing is possible. This kissing is a sunnah at the beginning of \nthe tawaf and recommended in the rest of it. The evidence for \nkissing is in the two Sahih collections that 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) kissed it and said, \"I know that you are a merely a stone \nwhich can bestow neither harm nor benefit. If it had not been that \nI had seen the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) kiss you, I would \nnot have kissed you.\"  \n \n28.4b The Tawaf of Arrival  \n \nThen you do tawaf keeping the House on your left, going \nround it seven times \n  \nAfter kissing the Black Stone, you perform Tawaf of Arrival. It is \nobligatory for every one who assumes ihram, whether he is one of \nthe people of Makka or elsewhere. When he goes into ihram from \nthe Haram, he does not do the Tawaf of arrival since he is not \narriving.  \n \nTawaf, whether it is a pillar, obligation or desirable practice, has \nobligatory parts, sunan and recommended parts.  \n \n28.4c The Obligatory parts of Tawaf  \n \nIt has six obligatory parts, the first ones being the preconditions \nfor the prayer:  \n \n1. Purity from ritual impurity and uncleanness, and covering the \nprivate parts. If he breaks wudu' while performing it, he purifies \nhimself and begins again, based on the famous position. Speech is \npermitted in it since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"Tawaf of the House is prayer although Allah has allowed \nspeech in it, so one should only speak good.\"  \n \n2.  Tawaf is done inside the masjid.  \n \n3.  He puts the House on his left. If he puts it on his right, his \ntawaf is not valid and he must repeat it. He should take care \nwhen he begins the tawaf and stand a little before the corner so \nthat the Stone is on his right of where he stands. That is what \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. If he does not \ncompletely encompass the Stone, he has not completed the first \ncircuit. He should take note of that: the ignorant often err in \nthat. His tawaf is outside the House, and the one who kisses \nthe Black Stone must only walk after he had stood upright as \nbefore. He is not permitted to kiss it and then walk with bowed \nhead or his hand so that he does not achieve some of the tawaf. \nAll his body would not be outside the House because part of his \nbody is on the buttress, which is part of the House and thus his \ntawaf would not be valid.  \n \n4.  Seven circuits. He begins from the Stone and ends at the Black \nStone. If he begins from the Yemeni corner, he ends with it and \nmust sacrifice.  \n \n5.  Continuity. If he forgets a circuit and then remembers soon \nafter and has not broken wudu', he returns to it, as he would to \nthe prayer. If it is a long time, then the tawaf is invalid by \nanalogy with the prayer.  \n \n6. Praying two rak'ats after it.]  \n \n28.4d Its sunan  \n \nThree times at a fast pace between walking and running \nand four times at a normal walking pace \n  \nIts sunan are four:  \n \n1. One is the fast pace three times, which is going faster than \nwalking but not running. It is Sunnah for the man and not the \nwoman, even if he is ill. He owes no sacrifice for omitting it, even \nif he able to do it. Then four circuits are done walking. The \nevidence for all of this is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did it.  \n \n2. Supplication, which is not defined.  \n \n3. Kissing the Black Stone at the beginning of the tawaf as was \nsaid.  \n \n4. Kissing the Yemeni Corner in the first circuit.  \n \n28.4e Recommended parts  \n \nEvery time you pass the Black Stone, you greet it in the \nway we have already mentioned and say 'Allahu Akbar'. \nYou do not kiss the Yamani corner but you greet it by \ntouching it with your hand which you then raise to your \nmouth without missing it  \n \nIts recommended parts are four:  \n \n1. Kissing the Black Stone in the beginning of every circuit except \nthe first if you are able to do so. Otherwise you place your hand on \nit and then on your mouth without kissing it. You do this while \nsaying the takbir.  \n \n2. Kissing the Yemeni corner at the beginning of every circuit \nother than the first.  \n \n3. Going close to the House for men rather women.  \n \n4. Supplication at the Multazam after finishing the tawaf. The \nMultazam is between the Yemeni corner and the door. He hugs it \nand makes intense supplication.  \n \n28.4f Two rak'ats at the end  \n \nWhen you have finished your tawaf you pray two rak’ats at \nthe Maqam Ibrahim. Then if you are able to you greet the \nBlack Stone once more  \n \nHis words include an obligation and two recommended parts. The \nobligation is to do two rak'ats after tawaf . The two \nrecommendations are doing it at the Maqam and connecting them \nto tawaf. It would mean that there is no sacrifice at all on account \nof not connecting them: but that is not the case. There is a \nsacrifice in some instances. Nor is the recommendation absolute: it \nis recommended for some and obligatory for some in which case \nthere is a sacrifice as a consequence of omitting it.  \n \nSo someone who does not do two rak'ats until he is far away or has \nreturned home must absolutely perform them. If they are part of \nan obligatory tawaf he owes a sacrifice. If they are from another \ntawaf, then no sacrifice is obliged for that. If he has not gone far or \nreturned to his land and has not broken his purity, then he only \nperforms two rak'ats. If his purification is broken deliberately, he \ndoes the tawaf and two rak'ats, even if they are not obligatory and \nrepeats the tawaf, the two rak'ats, and sa'y. In other than that he \nrepeats it. Does he repeat the tawaf or not? The apparent meaning \nis to prefer the second, and he does not kiss the Yemeni corner. \nAfter Kissing the Black Stone it is recommended to go to Zamzam \nand drink from it.  \n \n28.5 Sa'y at Safa and Marwa  \n \n28.5a Beginning sa'y  \n \nand then go off to Safa where you stand and make du'a \n  \nShaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that it is recommended to leave by the \ndoor of Safa since it is closest to Safa. Shaikh Zarruq \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted from Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) went out by it.  \n \n28.5b Going to Marwa  \n \nFrom there you walk to Marwa going faster across the \nbottom of the valley. When you reach Marwa you stand for \na time making du'a and then walk back to Safa. You do this \nseven times, standing four times on Safa and four times on \nMarwa \n  \nHe should walk quickly in the bottom of the valley, particularly \nwhen going to Marwa: this is the Sunnah for men rather than \nwomen. The valley is what is between the two green markers \nwhich are on the wall of the Masjid al-Haram to the left going to \nMarwa. The first of them is at the corner of the masjid under the \nminaret and the second is opposite Ribat al-'Abbas. The \nsupplication made on Marwa and Safa is not specified. Stopping \nthere is Sunnah.  \n \nThis sa'y is one of the pillars of the hajj and 'umra which is \nnecessary and no sacrifice or anything else can compensate for its \nomission. Its obligatory nature is indicated by the Book and \nSunnah. It has preconditions, sunan and recommended parts.  \n \nIts preconditions are four:  \n \n1. The proper order, which is that sa'y is done after tawaf. If he \nbegins with sa'y, he returns and does sa'y .  \n \n2. Continuity, If he sits for a long time and becomes like someone \nwho stops, he must begin the sa'y again. If it is a short stop, it \ndoes not impair it. If he is afflicted by incontinence he does wudu' \nan d builds on what he has done. Speech in it is less than speech \nin tawaf, i.e. he should only speak softly.  \n \n3. Completing the number: seven. If anyone omits a circuit of hajj \nor 'umra, whether the hajj or 'umra are sound or unsound, he \nshould return for that from his land. If anyone omits a cubit of the \nsa'y, that is not adequate.  \n \n4. It should be preceded it by a sound tawaf. It is not a \nprecondition that it be an obligatory one. Any tawaf is enough \naccording to Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) and that is \nwhat Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) understood from the \nMudawwana, but is preferred, Shaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the famous position is that it is a precondition \nthat it is obligatory like the Tawaf al-Ifada and Tawaf of Arrival.  \n \nThen after he finishes the sa'y the time of Standing is near.  \n \n28.6 At Mina  \n \nOn the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijja) you go to Mina \nwhere you pray Dhuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, 'Isha' and Subh  \n \nIt is called Mina because Nabi Ibrahim (alaihi salam) wished \n(tamanna) in that the command to sacrifice his son would be \ntaken from him. It is said that it is because the blood is shed \n(amna) there. It is six miles from Makka. It is recommended to go \nout to it so that when you reach it, the time of prayer will be near. \nIt is recommended to spend the night there. The basis for this is \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it. Imam Ahmad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) prayed five prayers at Mina: Dhuhr and Subh and what \nis between them. If someone fails to spend the night there, that is \ndisliked, but he does not owe a sacrifice for it.  \n \n28.7 At 'Arafat  \n \nand then you go to 'Arafat \n  \n28.7a Its time  \n \nWhen you have prayed Subh on the ninth day at Mina, it is \nrecommended not to leave it until after sunrise. Then you go to \n'Arafat, which is the place of standing. When you reach 'Arafat, it \nis recommended that the camp at Namira, which is at the end of \nthe Haram and the beginning of the non-Haram.  \n \n28.7b Leading up to the Standing  \n \nDuring this time you continue to recite the talbiya ceasing \nwhen the sun has passed its zenith on the Day of 'Arafat \nand you have reached the place of prayer there. You \nshould have a ghusl before going off to do the prayer on \n'Arafat  \n \nFrom the time you leave from sunrise you continue talbiya. The \nplace of prayer is the masjid of Namira. You should perform a \nghusl after midday before going out. You do not rub thoroughly in \nthe ghusl, but only pass the hands over. This is the last of three \nghusls of hajj. It is for standing, not for prayer, and the woman \nwho is menstruating or in lochia should do it as well.  \n \n28.7c Joining Dhuhr and 'Asr  \n \nwhere you join Dhuhr and 'Asr with the Imam \n  \nThey are joined and shortened. He adds in the Mudawwana, with \ntwo adhans and two iqamas and recitation is silent, not aloud, \neven if it coincides with Jumu'a because he is praying Dhuhr and \nnot Jumu'a. If someone misses joining with the Imam, he joins the \nprayers wherever he is. Shortening at 'Arafa is for the Sunnah.  \n \n28.7d The standing  \n \nThen you accompany him to the standing place at 'Arafat \nand stay there with him till the sun has set \n  \nThis shows that the Standing of 'Arafa is not its prayer place. It is \nvalid to stand in every part of it although it is recommended to \nstand at the large boulders lying at the base of the Mount of \nMercy, the mountain in the middle of 'Arafat. That because it is \nwhere the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) stood. The \nstanding begins after midday.  \n \nHe stands with him until sunset according to what Shaikh al-\nFakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others said and others which \nwould not include any part of the night. The School is that it must \ninclude a part of the night. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"The minimum obligation in the pillar of standing is \nto be present part of the night in a part of 'Arafa wherever he \nwishes except for the bottom of 'Uruna. In short, the fiqh is that \nstanding at 'Arafa after midday is obligatory which can be \nremedied by sacrifice. The standing part of the pillar is a part of \nthe night after sunset. What is considered as standing is the most \nperfect meaning. If he passes through 'Arafat at night and does \nnot stand, that is adequate with two conditions: he knows that \nthis place is 'Arafa and that he intends to be present at 'Arafa. \nThis does not include the one who passes not knowing that this \nplace is 'Arafa. It is recommended to stay there mounted since the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. It is recommended \nto glorify and praise Allah azza wa jall, say the shahadah and the \nprayer on Sayyidina Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam), and \nmake supplication. It is recommended to not fast so as to be strong \nin worship.  \n \n28.8 At Muzdalifa  \n \n28.8a Going to Muzdalifa  \n \nThen when he moves off to go to Muzdalifa you go after \nhim, praying Maghrib, 'Isha and Subh with him at \nMuzdalifa \n  \nAfter sunset on the day of 'Arafa when the night is well advanced, \nyou set out with the Imam for Muzdalifa. If you go before him \nafter sunset, then you abandon the best course. When you arrive \nthere, the first concern is to perform the prayer shortly after \nstopping. You pray the prayers with the Imam at Muzdalifa joined \nand shortened, except for the people of Muzdalifa. The School is \nthat this joining is Sunnah. When dawn comes, it is recommended \nfor him to pray Subh with the Imam at the beginning of the time. \nSo it is recommended to spend the night at Muzdalifa, as is stated \nin the Mukhtasar. Dismounting is obligatory. It is not enough to \nmake the camel kneel: you must dismount. Whoever fails to \ndismount without excuse until dawn owes a sacrifice. Whoever \nomits it for an excuse owes nothing.  \n \n28.8b Standing at Mash'ar al-Haram  \n \nAfter that you stand there with him at the Mash'ar al-\nHaram  \n \nIt is recommended in the well-known school to stop with him \nfacing the House. Mash'ar is a mountain at Muzdalifa. It is called \nthat because in the Jahiliyya they used to mark their sacrifices \nthere. This is the day of Sacrifice. He prays Subh or stops at \nMuzdalifa until the sun has risen.  \n \n28.9 Back to Mina  \n \n28.9a Crossing Muhassir  \n \nand shortly after sunrise, you go to Mina hurrying your \nmount across the Valley of Muhassir \n  \nIts apparent meaning, as the Mukhtasar, is that it is permitted to \ncontinue standing at the Mash'ar until the whitening of the sun. \nIn the Mudawwana, no one stays at the Mash'ar until sunrise or \nwhitening, but moves on before that. The Sahih indicates the first. \nIt says that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \"came to the \nMash'ar al-Haram, faced qibla and praised Allah azza wa jall, \nproclaimed Him great, unified Him and prayed to Him. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) remained standing until it was very bright.\" The \none riding is recommended to make his mount hurry. Muhassir is \na valley between Muzdalifa and Mina. The path is between them. \nIf he is walking, he walks quickly. A woman does not hurry. This \nhurrying is an act of devotion.  \n \n28.9b Stoning the Jamrat al-'Aqaba  \n \nWhen you get to Mina you stone the Jamrat al-'Aqaba using \nseven small pebbles  \n \ni.e. you begin to stone them first when you reach Mina in \nwhatever state you are, riding or otherwise. It is the end of Mina \non the Makkan side. It is called Jamra from the name of what is \nthrown at it: stones. Stoning is done from dawn to sunset on the \nDay of Sacrifice and the time of making it up covers all of the days \nof sacrifice. Indeed, the night after every day is for making up for \nthat day. There is no disagreement that sacrifice is obliged for \nmissing it. Missing it occurs at sunset of the fourth of the days of \nMina. They disagree about its obligation whether the hajj is \ninvalidated by missing any of the jamras.  \n \nStoning has preconditions for its validity. One of the preconditions \nof validity is that he puts the stone between his thumb and \nforefinger. It is said that he holds it with his thumb and middle \nfinger. They are thrown one after the other, Less than that is not \nadequate, even if he throws seven pebbles at once reckoning each \nof them to be one of the stones he throws. Mud is not acceptable \nnor are minerals like iron. There is disagreement about the size of \nwhat is thrown. That which most Shaikhs (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsay is that it is like a date stone. The very small, like gravel is not \nenough.  \n \n28.9c What is said during the stoning  \n \nand saying \"Allahu Akbar\" with each pebble as you throw it \n  \nThis is recommended. If he does not say that takbir, the stoning is \nenough, and he continues to throw the pebbles. It is disliked for \nhim to take a stone and break it and to make pebbles. It is \ndesirable to pick them up from the earth and that they be pure. \nThe stoning should be from the bottom of the valley, Stoning the \nJamra al-'Aqaba makes everything lawful except women and \nhunting. It is called the lesser coming out of ihram. The Tawaf al-\nIfada makes everything lawful for him, even women and hunting. \nIt is called the greater coming out of ihram.  \n \n28.9d Sacrifice  \n \nThen, if you have a sacrificial animal with you, you make \nsacrifice \n  \nHe stands with it at 'Arafa and Mina. All are places for sacrifice \nexcept what is beyond the Jamra al-'Aqaba and the Imam does not \nwait there since the „Id prayer is not there.  \n \n28.9e Shaving the head  \n \nThen you shave your head  \n \nAfter the sacrifice. Or you can shorten it if a man's hair is not \nmatted or plaited. If it is matted or plaited, then it is shaved. \nShaving is only obliged in those two cases. The entire head must \nbe shaved. Doing part of it is like not doing it. If someone has \nsomething wrong with his head so that he cannot shave, he \nsacrifices. As for the woman, the Sunnah for her is to shorten her \nhair.  \n \n28.10 Back to Makka  \n \nAfter that you go the House and do Tawaf al-Ifada going \nround seven times and finishing with the prayer \n  \nIt is the last of the four pillars of hajj which is not mended by \nsacrifice and by it all that was forbidden becomes allowed, even \nwomen and hunting. Taken from his words is that it is better to go \nto do it soon on the Day of Sacrifice. That is indeed the case. But if \nyou delay it past the days of tashriq, sacrifice is not obliged. \nSacrifice is obliged if you leave it until Dhu'l-Hijja is over in the \nfamous position. A counter statement is that if he delays it to the \n11th, then he is obliged to sacrifice. The explanation of \"going \naround\" is that he does not hurry in this tawaf or do sa'y because \nhe did sa'y after the Tawaf of Arrival. This in respect of the one \nwho is not pressed for time. As for the one who was pressed for \ntime so that it was not feasible for him to do the Tawaf of Arrival, \nit is desirable that he trots in the Tawaf of Ifada  \n  \n \n28.11 Back to Mina  \n \n28.11a Staying for three days  \n \nYou then stay for three days at Mina \n  \nThree days and nights if he is not in a hurry. If he omits most of \nthe nights, he is obliged to sacrifice. Shortening of the prayer is \nnot prescribed.  \n \n28.11b Stoning the jamras  \n \nOn each day after the sun has passed the zenith, you first \nstone the jamra nearest Mina using seven small pebbles \nand saying, 'Allahu Akbar' with each pebble thrown. You \nthen stone the other two jamras with the same number of \npebbles again saying \"Allahu Akbar\" as you throw each \none. After stoning the first two jamras you stand and make \ndu'a but after stoning the jamra al-Aqaba you do not stand \nbut move straight off \n  \nOn these three days. He does the middle one second and finishes \nwith the third, which is the Jamra al-'Aqaba, using seven stones \neach time. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \n\"after the zenith\" means before the prayer. If he stones before the \nzenith, it is not enough and he repeats it after midday, as when he \nstones the Jamra al-'Aqaba before Fajr.  \n \n28.11c Leaving for Makka  \n \nWhen you have finished stoning on the third day, making \nfour days including the ‘Id, you leave for Makka  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that he does not stay \nat Mina after stoning on the third day. It is recommended to stop \nat Muhassab and pray Dhuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib and 'Isha' there and \nto enter Makka at night since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did that as the Companions after him. If he prays Dhuhr \nbefore it, he owes nothing, and if he does not stop, he does not \nhave to sacrifice anything.  \n \n28.11d The completion of the hajj  \n \nand your hajj is complete \n  \nIf he means by complete the sunan, obligations and excellent \nparts, there still remains the Tawaf of Farewell. If he means the \nobligations, they are complete before that. He must mean its \nobligations and sunan and so he did not consider the Tawaf of \nFarewell because it is not particular to the hajj. It is done by \nwhoever leaves Makka after the hajj or any other reason.  \n \n28.11e Hurrying up departure from Mina  \n \nIf you want, you can speed up your departure by staying \nonly two days at Mina, leaving after finishing stoning on \nthe second day \n  \nThis is when the sun has not set on the second day. When it sets, \nthere is no hurrying because the night obliges camping there for \nthe stoning of the day. If the sun has set, it is as he is obliged to do \nthe third day.  \n \n28.12 Leaving Makka  \n \nWhen you are about to leave Makka you do the Tawaf of \nFarewell and the two rak’ats after it and then leave \n  \nThis tawaf is recommended and sacrifice is owed for omitting it. \nWhen he finishes it, he prays two rak'ats. Shaikh ibn Farhun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the Tawaf of Farewell has two \nrak'ats and if he omits them until he is far away or arrives home, \nhe prays them then and owes nothing. If he is near and still in a \nstate of purity, he returns to them. If he has broken wudu', he \npurifies himself and begins the tawaf again and then prays them.  \n \n28.13 'Umra  \n \nFor 'umra you do the same as we said at the beginning of \nthis chapter up until when you have completed the sa'y \nbetween Safa and Marwa. You then shave your head and \nyour 'umra is complete \n  \nThis shows that its pillars are three: ihram, tawaf and sa'y. It has \ntwo miqats: time and place. The time is all time, and the place is \noutside the Haram, whether he is foreign or resident in Makka. It \nwould appear from his words then that 'umra is not complete until \nhe shaves his head. That is not the case because Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that his 'umra is compete by tawaf and \nsa'y. Shaving is one of the preconditions of perfection, not one of \nvalidity, and so that is no contradiction in its being mandatory. \nWhat he meant by the end of the 'umra is its perfection and so \nthere is no contradiction.  \n \n28.14 Cutting the hair  \n \n28.14a For men  \n \nFor both hajj and 'umra it is better to shave your head but \nshortening the hair is acceptable in which case the hair \nshould be shortened all over the head \n  \nThis is not absolute: shortening is preferable in the tamattu' hajj \nso that the dishevelment remains for hajj. Shaikh Zarruq \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) stated that. The practice of shaving is only \ncomplete by shaving the entire head since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did that. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the Sunnah in shortening for men is to cut close \nto the roots. The minimum is to cut off something from all the \nhair. It is not enough cut some of all the hair, even the amount of \na finger. If he shortens only some, he misses the Sunnah.  \n \n28.14b For women  \n \nThe Sunnah for women is to shorten the hair \n  \nIt is disliked for her to shave and it is said that it is haram \nbecause it is mutilation. She shortens her hair. The basis for that \nis what Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Women do not have to \nshave. Women shorten their hair.\"  \n \n28.15 Requirements of Ihram  \n \n28.15a Killing harmful animals  \n \nThere is no harm in someone in ihram killing a rat, snake, \nscorpion or such like nor in killing a dangerous dog or any \nother dangerous animal such as a jackal or a lion \n  \nIt is permitted to kill these categories. Similar to rats are \ncreatures which chew clothes, like weasels. Snakes and vipers \nincludes hornets. A dangerous dog is one which will attack. \nDangerous animals include hyenas and tigers.  \n \n28.15b Killing harmful birds  \n \nYou can also kill crows and kites if you fear they will harm \nyou but not any other birds. You can kill birds whose harm \nis feared, like crows and kites \n  \nThese two types are killed, even if they do not initiate harm, large \nor small. Other birds, harmful or not, are not killed. That is one of \ntwo statements which Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nreported. What is preferred of the two is to kill them if they cause \nharm.  \n \n28.15c Avoiding women  \n \nWhen doing hajj or 'umra you should avoid women  \n \nThis is an obligation. Avoiding women means avoiding enjoyment \nof them by intercourse or anything else. That is obligatory since it \nabsolutely invalidates the hajj, whether it is genital or anal, \nhuman or not, intentional, out of forgetfulness of ignorance, with \nejaculation or not, whether it obliges the hadd or mahr or not, \nwith an adult or not. It is clear from what they say, as in al-\nAhjuri, even if ghusl is not obliged.  \n \nThe second Sunnah that he assumes ihram for making up hajj. \nThat does not spare him the missed one and its ihram. The second \nis ineffectual which has no place while he is in a false ihram and \nhis ihram is not for making it up. He is obliged to complete it \nwhen he has done the Standing in the year in which he corrupted \nit. If he does not catch it, then he is commanded to come out of it \nby doing 'umra He is not permitted to remain in ihram by \nagreement because it is continuing the corrupted while he is able \nto be free of it.  \n \nAs for actions which precede intercourse, like the kiss and the \nembrace, they are unlawful. If he kisses or embraces and has \nejaculated, it is invalidated. Otherwise he should sacrifice a camel. \nAs for the look and the thought, they do not entail invalidation by \nthe emission of sperm because of them unless both of them were \nfor pleasure and continued. As for its emission by simply looking \nor the thought, there is only sacrifice for it. These are the \njudgments for the emission of sperm. It obliges a sacrifice \nabsolutely whether it emerges after constantly looking, thought, \nkiss or touch or not.  \n \n28.15d Avoiding perfume  \n \nperfume \n  \nHe must avoid perfume in hajj or 'umra like rose or jasmine, for \nwhich there is no fidyat, or feminine perfume, which is what has a \nsubstance which stays on the body and clothes, like musk, and \nsaffron. There is fidya for it, even if it is quickly removed.  \n \n28.15e Avoiding stitched clothing \n  \nstitched clothing \n  \nThere is no disagreement that they are unlawful for men but not \nwomen. What is meant is all that surrounds the body or part of it. \nIt is also unlawful for him to wear turbans, trousers and \nburnooses.  \n \n28.15f Avoiding hunting  \n \nhunting \n  \nHe must also avoid hunting in land, whether the reason for \nhunting is to eat meat like the antelope, and wild ass or not, like \nmonkeys without difference between them being tame or wild, \nowned or permitted. There is no exception for that except what is \ntransmitted in the hadith: the kite and crow, rate, scorpion, and \ndangerous dogs.  \n \n28.15g Killing insects  \n \nkilling insects  \n \nHe does not kill lice or remove them from his body.  \n \n28.15h Removing hair from the body  \n \nand removing any hair from your body \n  \nLike clipping the mustache which resembles removing hair. If he \nremoves any of his hair, he owes a handful of grain.  \n \n28.15i Not covering the head  \n \nWhen you are in ihram, you should not cover your head \nnor should you shave it except in a case of necessity \n  \nIt is forbidden for the one in ihram to cover his head and face with \nany covering, be it like mud, let alone a turban. As for other things \nwhich cover the body, it is forbidden to cover with something \nspecific which is stitched. The head is not shaved by the words of \nthe Almighty, \"But do not shave your heads until the sacrificial \nanimal has reached the place of sacrifice. If any of you are ill or \nhave a head injury, there is an expiation\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:196) \nwhich means: shaving to remove harm, and so the fidya is fasting, \nsadaqa, or practices: He indicates this:  \n \n28.15j Its expiation  \n \nIf you do you must make expiation by fasting three days or \nfeeding six destitute people with two mudds each, using \nthe mudd of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) or \nsacrificing a sheep. This sacrifice does not have to be \ncarried out in any particular place \n  \nThis could even be three days at Mina. He must perform an act of \ndevotion. It could be a sheep or something else. He only mentioned \nsheep because fidya is done the best meat. It must be slaughtered. \nIt is not enough to give it without sacrificing it, as some of them \nsaid. The lack of particular place is qualified to when the animal \nwas not garlanded or marked. If it was garlanded or marked, then \nhe only sacrifices it at Mina.  \n \n28.15k What women wear  \n \nWomen may wear khuffs and ordinary clothing while they \nare in ihram but in all other respects they must avoid the \nsame things as men \n  \nThey can absolutely wear leather socks, even if she has sandals. \nThey wear stitched clothes in ihram. Outside of this, they avoid \nthe same things: intercourse and foreplay, hunting, killing \nanimals, removing hair. There is no way she can avoid covering \nher head.  \n \n28.15l A woman's ihram  \n \nA woman's ihram consists in her not covering her face and \nhands  \n \nShe shows her face and hands, and it is forbidden for her to cover \nthem with anything, even mud. She cannot wear a veil. If she does \nany of this, she must do fidya.  \n \n28.15m A man's ihram  \n \nand man's ihram in his not covering his face and head \n  \nA man must show his face and head while in ihram, night and \nday. If he covers any of that and benefits, that is forbidden for him \nand he does fidya whether it is out of forgetfulness, knowingly or \nout of ignorance. If he removes it immediately, he owes nothing. \nHe is permitted to use a pillow and shield himself from the sun or \nwind with his hand. The hand is not considered a covering unless \nit is touching the head and for a long time. In such case he must \ndo fidya as it says the 'Utibiyya. He is permitted to carry his \nbaggage and other things on his head as necessary, like a bundle \nof firewood which he carries to sell. If he carries it for someone \nelse or for trade, there is fidya. He is permitted to seek the shade \nof the buildings and tents.  \n \n28.15n Wearing leather socks  \n \nA man may not wear khuffs while he is in ihram unless he \nhas not got any thronged sandals in which case he should \ncut his khuffs down to below the ankles \n  \nAs is reported in the hadith. Then he proceeds to clarify which \ntype of hajj is best:  \n \n28.16 Ifrad is best  \n \nAccording to us doing Hajj by itself is better than doing \n('umra then hajj separately in the same season) or (hajj and \n'umra together)  \n \nIfrad is best based on what is in the two Sahih collections that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did ifrad in the Farewell Hajj \nand that continued to be the action of the khalifs. Abu Bakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) did ifrad in 2 AH, 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nin 10 AH and Uthman (rahmatullahi alaihi) in 12. It has not been \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did qiran \nor tamattu'. The Imam said that some of the Companions \ncommanded qiran and some tamattu'. Ifrad does not need to be \nmended by sacrifice as opposed to qiran and tamattu'. They need \nthat.  \n \n28.16a Someone not from Makka not doing ifrad  \n \nIf someone who is not from Makka does qiran or tamattu'  \n \nIt is understood that the people of Makka do not have to sacrifice. \nWhat is meant by them are those who are present there or at Dhu \nTuwa at the time the practices are performed. There are two \nconditions for the sacrifice of the one doing qiran: that he does not \nlive in Makka or Dhu Tuwa and that he makes hajj in the same \nyear. If he misses the hajj, he comes out of 'umra and owes no \nsacrifice. If he omits the first and does not come out of ihram for \n'umra and remains in ihram, it is not canceled for him. Then he \nclarifies the place of the sacrifice.  \n \n28.16b The sacrifice to mend it at Mina  \n \nhe must sacrifice an animal at Mina \n  \nAt Mina in the day after Fajr. It is not enough to do it as night. \nThe basis in all that is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did it. There are preconditions for the validity of the \nsacrifice:  \n \n28.16c Preconditions for the validity of the sacrifice  \n \nwhich he had with him at 'Arafa \n  \n1. Whoever is obliged to sacrifice must have the animals at 'Arafa \nat night. Shaikh ibn Harun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"As for the \nprecondition of standing at night, I do not know of any dispute \nabout it because all who stipulate standing at 'Arafa at night, like \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), make its judgment that of its \nowner in what makes the standing acceptable.  \n \n2. The sacrifice must be during the days of Mina: the Day of \nSacrifice and the two days after it The fourth day is not included. \n  \n3. If the sacrifice is in the hajj, the sacrifice was driven under the \nihram of the hajj, whether it was obliged by something lacking, or \nin the 'umra, or voluntary to repay hunting.  \n \nWhen all these preconditions exist, is it not permitted to sacrifice \nat Makka or anywhere else: the sacrifice at Mina is obligatory. If \nhe lacks some of the preconditions, it is permitted for him.  \n \n28.16d Sacrifice at Marwa  \n \nIf he did not have it at 'Arafa he should sacrifice it in \nMakka at Marwa, having brought it there from outside the \nHaram  \n \nIf he missed it in the days of Mina, even if he stood at 'Arafa, then \nhe is obliged to sacrifice in Makka or the houses near it. He is not \nallowed to sacrifice at Dhu Tuwa and other places outside Makka, \neven if they are connected to the houses of Makka. That is only \nwhen he has brought the sacrifice from outside the Haram by any \naspect because every sacrifice must combine Haram and non-\nHaram. The sacrifice can be sheep, cattle or camels, but camels \nare best. Only sound animals are allowed in all like the sacrifices \nand sacrifice of these three is specified for the one doing tamattu' \nand qiran when he can do so.  \n \n28.16e Fasting three days on the hajj  \n \nIf you do not have a sacrificial animal you should fast \nthree days during the hajj, that being between the time \nyou go into ihram and the Day of 'Arafa \n  \nHe only mentions the tamattu' and not the qiran. The three days \nduring the hajj can be from the time of ihram to the day of 'Arafa. \nSo if the imperfection which obliges sacrifice is before standing at \n'Arafa, it is included in the time of fasting for three days, which is \nfrom ihram to 'Arafa because he can fast. He is like the one who \nexceeds the miqat and does tammatu' and qiran and omits the \nTawaf of Arrival. We said, 'before the standing' is if the \nimperfection occurs after standing, like not stopping in Muzdalifa, \nor not stoning or shaving, or delaying the three until the days of \ntashriq are over. Then he fasts them with the seven days when he \nwishes.  \n \n28.16f Fasting the days of Mina  \n \nIf you do not manage to do that you fast the days of Mina. \nThen when you return to your own country you fast seven \nmore days  \n \nIf he misses the three days in the hajj, he fasts them at Mina \nwithout incurring any sin if he delays the fast until then for an \nexcuse. After fasting the three, whether in the hajj or at Mina, he \nfasts the seven when he returns from Mina to Makka, whether he \nstays at Makka or not. If he delays it, he fasts whenever he \nwishes, and it is recommended that the three be consecutive, but \nit is not obligatory. The same applies to the ten. It is \nrecommended in the well-known position.  \n \n28.17 Tamattu'  \n \n28.17a How it is done  \n \nTo do tamattu', you go into ihram for 'umra only during the \nmonths of hajj, then come out of ihram, then go back into it \nagain for hajj that same year without having traveled back \nto your country or to anywhere else a similar distance \naway \n  \nIt is not a precondition that they are both in the months of hajj. If \nhe goes into ihram in Ramadan and then completes it in Shawwal, \nhe does tamattu' even if a pillar falls into the months of hajj. If \nonly shaving remains for him and it happens in the months of \nhajj, he is not doing tamattu'. Then he performs hajj in this year \nbecause if they were not both in the same year, there is no \ntamattu'. He is also not doing tamattu' if he returns to his land \nafter his 'umra in the months of hajj before going into ihram for \nhajj. So tamattu' is true in any form when he finishes 'umra in the \nmonths of hajj and goes into ihram for hajj before he returns to his \nland.  \n \n28.17b Coming out of 'umra and going into ihram for hajj  \n \nIf this is the case you are permitted to go back into ihram \nfrom Makka if that is where you are but to do you must go \noutside the haram territory \n  \nWhen he comes out of 'umra, he goes into ihram in Makka. In this \ncase it is recommended that he do it from the door of the masjid. \nHe does not go into ihram from Makka because one of the \npreconditions of 'umra is that he combine being in and out of \nihram.  \n \n28.18 Qiran  \n \nTo do qiran you go into ihram for hajj and 'umra together, \nmaking the intention to do 'umra first. If you decide to do \nHajj as well as 'umra before you have done the tawaf and \nits following two rak’ats you are considered as doing qiran \n  \nHe begins with 'umra. It appears from his words that he does not \nmake it consecutive in tawaf. The well-known position is that it is \npermitted. It is valid after he completes it and before praying the \nrak'ats, but it is disliked. If he prays the rak'ats, he misses \nconsecutiveness. Whoever does it consecutively (arfada) after sa'y \nis not doing qiran by agreement.  \n \n28.19 Particulars on tamattu' and qiran  \n \n28.19a People of Makka doing tamattu' or qiran  \n \nThe people of Makka do not have to sacrifice if they are \ndoing tamattu' or qiran \n  \nIt is agreed that they do not have to sacrifice in tamattu' or qiran \naccording to the well-known position.  \n \n28.19b When it is not tamattu'  \n \nIf you come out of ihram after an 'umra before the months \nof hajj and then stay on for hajj during the same year, you \nare not considered as doing tamattu'  \n \nIf he delays the shaving until the months of hajj.  \n \n28.20 Atonement for hunting in ihram  \n \n28.20a Expiation  \n \nIf you kill any game while in ihram you have to make \nexpiation for it by sacrificing a domestic animal equivalent \nto the one you killed \n  \nWhether its flesh is eaten or not. The Lawgiver said whether the \nkiller in ihram is doing hajj or 'umra, or is in the Haram, even if \nhe is not a muhrim, whether he is free or slave, male or female, \nyoung or old, and the killing is deliberate or accidental, or by \nforgetfulness direct or causal. This sacrifice is an obligation. The \nlikeness is in form and value, or close to it. So the one who kills an \nelephant owes a Khurassan camel with two humps. The one who \nkills a wild ox or wild ass or gazelle owes a domestic cow. The one \nwho kills an ostrich owes a camel because it is close in value and \nform. The one who kills a hyena, fox, or one of the doves of Makka \noutside the Haram must pay its price in food when it is killed. The \nleast of what is allowed in repayment for hunting is a lamb or kid \nbecause Allah azza wa jall called it a sacrifice and so it must meet \nthe preconditions of a sacrifice.  \n \n28.20b Who assesses it  \n \nThis should be ascertained by two trustworthy fuqaha' \nfrom among the Muslims \n  \nIf he pays it before their judgment on it, he repeats it, even if the \nevaluated thing is not eaten. The precondition of being \ntrustworthy is being free and adult. There must be the expression \n\"judgment\": fatwa is not enough. One of the preconditions of their \njudgment is that base their judgment on the judgment of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) and the Companions. A judgment \nwhich has no prior judgment is rejected and not carried out; and \nno one repays without a judgment. If he repays it without a \njudgment, he repeats it, even if it agrees with the judgment \npassed. An exception to are the doves of Makka and the Haram for \nwhich there is a sheep.  \n \n28.20c Where the sacrifice is done  \n \nIf the animals to be killed was with you on 'Arafa the \nsacrifice should be made at Mina. Otherwise it should be \nmade in Makka, the animal concerned having been \nbrought in from outside the Haram territory \n  \nThe place where it is slaughtered, i.e. the repayment of game if it \nis part of what is slaughtered and sacrificed. He or his \nrepresentative do it at Mina. Otherwise it is done in Makka.  \n \n28.20d The choice \n \nYou have the choice of doing this or of making kaffarah by \nfeeding destitute people, in which case you work out the \nvalue of the animal killed in terms of food and give that \namount away as sadaqa. Or alternatively you can fast one \nday for each mudd, fasting a whole day for any incomplete \nmudd \n  \nSomeone who kills game has a choice between two things. He can \ndo kaffarah, which is feeding from the predominant food of the \nplace where the game was killed, whatever it is. If it has no value \nthere, one considers its price in the nearest place to it, and he \ngives it as sadaqa to them. When he feeds, each poor person \nreceives a mudd. If he gives its price or goods, that is not enough.  \n \nThe second possibility is to fast. There is a day per mudd because \nhe cannot make it partial, and so it can only be mended by a \ncomplete day.  \n \n28.21 Going home  \n \n28.21a The ruling of 'umra  \n \n'Umra is a confirmed Sunnah to be done at least once in a \nlifetime \n  \nIt as two miqats: place, which are those of the hajj, and time, \nwhich is the entire year. It has three pillars: ihram, tawaf and \nsa'y. Shaving is not one of its pillars. The description of ihram for \nit is recommended to have a ghusl and what is permitted to dress \nand what is forbidden of scent, etc., is like the hajj. It is disliked to \nrepeat it in the same year in the well-known position.  \n \n28.21b Final du'a  \n \nWhen you leave Makka after hajj or 'umra, it is \nrecommended \nto \nsay: \n\"Ayibuna, \nta-ibuna, \n'abidana \nlirabbina, hamiduna, sadaqa'llahu wa'dahu wa nasara \n'abdahu \nwa \nhazama'l-Ahzaba \nwahdah. \n(Returning, \nrepentant, worshipping, praising our Lord. Allah had been \ntrue to His promise and given victory to His slave and \ndefeated the clans by Himself.)  \n \n \n \nChapter 29: On sacrifices, (animals sacrificed \nfor the birth of a child), , and drinks \n \n \n29.1 Animals for feast day and hajj sacrifices  \n \n29.1a The ruling of the ‘Id sacrifice  \n \nSacrificing an animal for the ‘Id is a Sunnah which is \nobligatory for all who are able to do so \n  \nAdhiya refers to animals which are brought to be sacrificed on the \nDay of al-Adha and afterwards. It is called that because of the day \nwhen they are sacrificed at Duha and it is called the „Id al-Adha \nbecause the prayer in it is at that time. It is a confirmed Sunnah \nin the well-known position for the one who is able, if he is free, \nMuslim, adult or child, male or female, resident or traveling, not \non hajj, because the Sunnah is for him to sacrifice for himself and \nthose relatives whose maintenance he is responsible for, like \nparents and poor children. By \"being able\" he avoids the one who \nis poor. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \none who is able is the one who would be injured in his property, \ni.e. the one who is not able to find its price in that year. \nPartnership is permitted in the reward for it rather than in its \nprice.  \n \n29.1b The minimum  \n \nThe least which is acceptable for it in the case of sheep is a \njadha, which is a one year old ram, although some have \nsaid eight months and some ten months old. In the case of \ngoats it should be a thaniyya, which means a male in its \nsecond year and likewise only thaniyya animals are \nacceptable in the case of cattle and camels. A thaniyya in \nrespect to cattle is a male in its fourth year and in respect \nto camels it is a six year old male \n  \nThis is the well-known position.  \n \n29.1c The most perfect animal  \n \nRams which have not been castrated are better for \nsacrifice than those which have been, but castrated rams \nare better than ewes. Ewes are better than either male or \nfemale goats. Male goats which have not been castrated are \nbetter than camels and cattle for ‘Id sacrifices \n  \nThis has to do with being more perfect. So there are twelve grades, \nthe highest is a uncastrated ram and the least is a female camel \nand cow.  \n \n29.1d The order in animals  \n \nAs regards 'hadys' (animals to be sacrificed as part of the \nhajj) camels are best and then cattle and then sheep and \nthen goats  \n \nThis is the famous position because what is desired of hadys is to \nhave a lot of meat for the poor, and what is desired of the dahiya is \ngood meat, i.e. for bringing to the family, Shaikh Bahram \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The evidence for us in the two places \nis that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to often \nmake his hadys camels and his dahiya was two rams, as is \nreported in the Sahih.  \n \n29.1e Unacceptable animals  \n \nIn none of these circumstances is it acceptable to sacrifice \na one-eyed animal or a sick animal or a markedly lame \nanimal or an emaciated animal  \n \nHowever, an animal with some whiteness in the eye which does \nnot entail blindness is permitted. Of course, a totally blind animal \nis not permitted. A clearly ill animal is not allowed, but one with a \nslight illness is permitted. Clear illness involves not eating \nnormally or eating a lot. Also excluded are animals having a lot \nmange and which have lost its teeth, except for a single tooth.  \n \n29.1f Other unacceptable animals  \n \nIn fact you should avoid using for sacrifice any animal \nwhich has something wrong with it. You should also avoid \nany split-eared animal unless the split is only slight. The \nsame applies to an animal whose ear has been cut off or \none with a broken horn. If it is bleeding it is not acceptable \nfor sacrifice. However, if it is not bleeding, it is acceptable \n  \nThis is if it is a lot, a little is overlooked. He includes split-eared \nanimals, and other forms of mangling the ears. There is \ndisagreement about the extent of cutting, That which is the \npredominant position is that a third of the ear is slight, and a \nthird of the tail is a lot because the tail is meat and sinew while \nthe ear is not. This is about the tail of the sheep which is a fat tail. \nAs for like the ox, camel and sheep in some lands which have no \nmeat on the tail, that which would prevent its acceptability is \nwhat decrease beauty. Bleeding refers to a wound which does not \nheal.  \n \n29.2 Time of Sacrifice  \n \n29.2a After the Imam  \n \nIt is good to sacrifice your animal yourself after the Imam \nhas made his sacrifice on the morning of the Day of \nSacrifice. If you slaughter your animal before the Imam \nyou must repeat your sacrifice \n  \nThat is recommended if it is possible to imitate the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam). If you cannot do that for some reason, \nthen you delegates Muslim, and it is recommended that he be one \nof the people of virtue and excellence. Anyone who does not pray is \ndisliked, but it is said that it is permitted in the well-known \nposition. It is not allowed to delegate an unbeliever of any \ndescription.  \n \nThe time of sacrifice begins from the time the Imam sacrifices on \nthe Day of Sacrifice, the 10th of Dhu'l-Hijja. He should sacrifice in \nthe morning, which is the time of the nafila. If anyone sacrifices \nbefore the Day of Sacrifice or after Fajr on the Day of Sacrifice and \nbefore sunrise, that is not permitted and he must repeat the \nsacrifice. This is based on the words of the Almighty, \"Do not \nadvance yourselves in front of Allah and of His Messenger.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 49:1) Shaikh al-Hasan al-Basri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"It was sent down about people who sacrificed before the Imam.\" \nThis is about the one who has an Imam.  \n \n29.2b When there is no Imam  \n \nIf there is no Imam with you, you should make sure you do \nnot do it before the time the Imam nearest to you would do \nso. The sacrifice must not be done at night \n  \nThey sacrifice at the proper time. If their error becomes evident to \nthem, it is allowed in the well-known position. One considers the \nImam of the prayer. It is not done at night on the second or third \nday. This is because Allah azza wa jall says, \"Mention Allah's \nName on particular days.\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:28) It is allowed to \nsacrifice in forenoon in the second or third day after dawn and \nbefore sunrise, but then he has abandoned what is recommended \nas opposed to the one who sacrifices in the first day after dawn \nand before sunrise which is not acceptable.  \n \n29.2c The three days of sacrifice  \n \nThere are three 'days of sacrifice' and you can make your \nsacrifice any time up until Maghrib on the last of these \ndays but the best time to make your sacrifice is on the first \nday \n  \nAccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), following a group \nof the Companions. It is the Day of Sacrifice and the two days \nafter it. The end of the time is sunset on the third day. The best \ntime follows what was done by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) and the right-guided khalifs (may Allah azza wa jall bless \nthem all).  \n \n29.2d On the second day  \n \nIf you do not manage to make your sacrifice before midday \non the first day some of the people of knowledge say that it \nis better to wait until the morning of the second day \n  \nThis is Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh Bahram \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \ntransmitted \nit \nfrom \nImam \nMalik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat they is no disagreement that what is done before midday \nfrom the beginning of the day is better than what is after it. There \nis disagreement about whether what is after midday of it is better \nthan before midday of the second day. That is the apparent \nmeaning of what the Mukhtasar says. It is the school of the \nRisala. The reliable position is that all of the first day is better \nthan what is after it.  \n \n29.2e None of the animal can be sold  \n \nNo part of an animal sacrificed for the ‘Id may be sold; \nneither its skin nor anything else \n  \nThis is a prohibition. This also applies to an 'Aqiqa. He refutes the \none who says that its skin can be sold.  \n \n29.3 Ritual of Sacrifice  \n \n29.3a Facing qibla  \n \nThe animal you are intending to sacrifice should be made \nto face the qibla  \n \nThis is in all sacrifices. If it is not done for some excuse or \nforgetfulness, it is agreed that it can be eaten.  \n \n29.3b What is said  \n \nand when you slaughter it you should say, \"Bismillahi, \nAllahu Akbar.\" (In the name of Allah. Allah is greater.)  \n \nHe says both. That is the action of the people. The takbir is \nSunnah, i.e. recommended. The basmala is taken from his (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) words afterwards, and it is the position in the \nMudawwana. It is obligatory when remembered and one is able to \nsay it. It is omitted in case of lack of ability and forgetfulness. If \nhe confines himself to it, that is sufficient by the words of Allah, \n\"Eat from that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 6:118) Nothing is a precondition but the name of \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \n29.3c What is said on ‘Id sacrifices  \n \nIf, when sacrificing for the ‘Id you add \"Rabbana taqabbal \nminnâa (Our Lord, accept this from us), there is no harm in \nthat \n  \nThis means it is recommended. It is also said that it is permission.  \n \n29.3d If the basmala is forgotten  \n \nIf you forget to say 'Bismillah' when sacrificing an animal \nfor the ‘Id or at any other time you are permitted to eat it. \nHowever, if the Bismillah is left out deliberately the animal \ncannot be eaten \n  \nAccording to the position of the Mudawwana, it is obligatory when \nremembered.  \n \n29.3e When hunting  \n \nThe same thing applies to sending hunting animals out \nafter game \n  \nOr shooting an arrow and the like used for hunting. It is eaten. If \nthe basmala is deliberately omitted, it is not eaten by the words of \nAllah, \"Do not eat from that over which the name of Allah has not \nbeen mentioned.\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:121) The Almighty said, \"Eat \nfrom what they bring you and mention the name of Allah over it.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 5:4)  \n \n29.4 Use of animals for various types of sacrifice  \n \n29.4a Not sold, but eaten from and given away  \n \nIt is not permissible to sell the meat, skin, fat, innards, or \nany other part of an animal that has been sacrificed either \nfor the ‘Id or for a new-born child or as part of the Hajj, but \nyou are allowed to eat from such an animal and it is \nrecommended to give some away as sadaqa although it is \nnot obligatory to do this \n  \nThis includes horn, wool and hair. It is possible that the excellence \nis specific or that it refers to combining eating and sadaqa, which \nis the literal meaning by the words of the Almighty, \"Eat from \nthem and feed those who are poor and in need.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n22:28) and His words, \"feed both those who ask and those who are \ntoo shy to ask\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:32) whether he asks or not. Giving \nit all as sadaqa is disliked. There is no definition to how much is \neaten or given away. Most forbid feeding the unbeliever from it \nabsolutely, whether a Kitabi or Magian.  \n \n29.4b Not eating from an animal slaughtered for expiation  \n \nYou may not, however, eat from an animal you have \nsacrificed in expiation for breaking one of conditions of \nihram nor for one sacrificed on account of having killed \nwhile in ihram nor from one sacrificed as part of a vow you \nhave made to feed the poor nor from 'hadys' intended as \nvoluntary sacrifices which for some reason become \ndefective before reaching the place of sacrifice. In any \nother instances you can eat from your sacrifice if you want \n  \nThe hadis are not eaten as opposed to the dhahiya. The place of \nsacrifice is Mina if he had the animal at 'Arafa and it is within the \ndays of sacrifice, and at Makka if he did not stop there or if the \ndays of sacrifice have passed. It is haram to eat from the these \ncategories after they reach their place because Allah azza wa jall \ncalled the fidya and repayment kaffarah, and a man does not eat \nfrom his kaffarah. He excludes himself in the third case and gives \nit to the poor. He is permitted to eat it before the place because he \ncan still replace it. He is permitted to eat from voluntary hadis \nwhen they are defective after reaching the place. He is permitted \nto eat the hadis of qiran and tamattu' and the hadi of invalidation, \nand every hadi obliged for missing one of the marks of hajj \nabsolutely before reaching the place and after it by the lack of \nsuspicion before it reaches the place because he can replace it, and \nafter it the business is clear.  \n \n29.5 Slaughtering  \n \n29.5a Severing the throat and carotid arteries  \n \nThe correct method of slaughtering is to sever the throat \nand the carotid arteries and nothing short of that is \nacceptable \n  \nAll of the throat. The throat and arteries must all be cut: this is \nthe position of Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and is well-\nknown. It is said that it is enough to cut the arteries completely \nand half the throat. The literal words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) mean that it is not a precondition to cut the gullet. Qadi \n'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the gullet is the path of food \nand drink.  \n \n29.5b A single stroke  \n \nIf you take your hand away after severing only part of that \nand then resume and compete the cutting, the animal \ncannot be eaten \n  \nIt is apparent that it is whether it is a long or short gap, but there \nis disagreement about when he returns the blade quickly. Shaikh \nSahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is unlawful. Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is eaten because all that is \nasked is that it be immediate and a small disparity is over looked. \nThat is the reliable position. The fiqh of the question is that if he \nlifts his hand after killing it and returns afterwards, it is not \neaten, even if he lifted his hand by necessity. If he lifts his hand \nbefore finishing any of the killing, it is eaten, even if he returns \nafterwards because the second is a separate slaughter.  \n \n29.5c Cutting off the head  \n \nIf you cut the head right off you have committed a wrong \naction, but the animal can be eaten \n  \nWhether it is deliberate, by forgetfulness or an overly sharp knife.  \n \n29.5d When the animal is slaughtered from the back of the \nneck  \n \nYou cannot eat an animal which has been slaughtered from \nthe back of the neck \n  \nIt has not be slaughtered in the prescribed manner and its death \narose out by cutting the spine. If it is killed by such slaughtering, \nit is not eaten, even if the throat is cut and the knife is hard on the \narteries because of the lack of sharpness in the knife and it cuts \nthe arteries from inside. It is not eaten according to the Maliki \nSchool.  \n \n29.5e Methods of slaughter  \n \nCattle should be slaughtered with a knife but if their \nthroats are pierced with a spear they can still be eaten \n  \nTwo forms are permitted in cattle because they have the place of \nsacrifice and the place of slaughter. The place of sacrifice is the \nupper breast. It is not a precondition in nahr slaughter that any of \nthe throat and arteries be cut because the place of the upper \nbreast is the place where the implement reaches the heart and the \nanimal dies quickly.  \n \n29.5f Camels  \n \nCamels should be pierced in the throat with a spear and if \nthey are slaughtered with a knife they may not be eaten \nalthough there is a difference of opinion about this \n  \nIt is recommended that camels be slaughtered while they are \nstanding. There is disagreement about eating them if they are \nslaughtered with a knife. The position that they are not eaten if \nthey are slaughtered like this is found in the Mudawwana. Shaikh \nibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes it as a prohibition and \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) thinks it is well-known. \nIt is what is preferred. Others consider it disliked. The dispute is \nabout when such a slaughter is unnecessary. If it is necessary, as \nwhen a camel falls into a hole and its upper chest cannot be \nreached and it is slaughtered, then it can be eaten by agreement.  \n \n29.5g Sheep and goats  \n \nSheep and goats should be slaughtered with a knife and if \ntheir throats are pierced with a spear they should not be \neaten although there is a difference of opinion about this \nalso \n  \nThis is when it is not due to necessity. The well-known position is \nthat it is forbidden. If it is due to necessity, as when it falls into a \nhole and slaughtered, there is agreement that it is eaten.  \n \n29.5h The fetus  \n \nThe slaughter of a mother includes what is in the womb \nprovided that the fetus is fully formed and its hair has \ngrown \n  \nThis is part of livestock. If it is slaughtered and there is dead fetus \nin it, it can be eaten with preconditions. It should be fully \ndeveloped. This does not mean that all its limbs are perfect. It can \nbe even if missing a leg.  \n \n29.6 Forbidden foods and animal by-products  \n \n29.6a Various forms of death  \n \nAn animal which has been strangled by a rope or suchlike \nor one that has been beaten with a stick or some other \nobject or one that has fallen from a height or one that has \nbeen gored or one that has been attacked by a wild beast \nmay not be slaughtered and eaten if the animal is going to \ndie from the wounds it has received \n  \n\"Suchlike\" includes the spear and the stone. This is because such \nanimals are carrion. If it is hoped that the animal will live, there \nis no dispute about sacrificing it. If there is no hope of life, Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said via Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that it is not sacrificed and not eaten. It is the position of \nthe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi). The school of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), which is transmitted from Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi), is that it is sacrificed and eaten. It is \nthe preferred position.  \n \n29.6b Carrion in dire need  \n \nThere is no harm in eating carrion (mayta) if you are in \ndire need  \n  \nFrom any living thing except human. If someone in ihram finds \nboth game and carrion, he eats the carrion. If he finds carrion and \npig, he eats the carrion. If he only finds pig, he eats it. It is \nrecommended to him to slaughter it and its slaughter is by \nwounding. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The \nevident position is that he does not need to slaughter it because \nslaughter does not benefit that which forbidden to eat.  \n \n29.6c How long carrion can be eaten  \n \nyou can eat from it until you are satisfied and take \nprovision from it so long as you throw it away when the \nneed for it no longer exists \n  \nThis is when he fear lack of food in the future. It is permissible for \nthe person compelled to eat carrion when he does not find any \nother food. If he is forced to take food belonging to other people, it \nis said that he confines himself to what is necessary for life \nwithout filling himself and taking provision, as Shaikh al-\nMawwaq (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated. It is said that he eats his \nfill \nand \ndoes \nnot \ntake \nprovision, \nas \nShaikh \nal-Huttab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said. As he is permitted to eat carrion in \nnecessity, he is also allowed to drink all that will repel thirst, like \nimpure water and other impure liquids, like impure rose water \nexcept for wine. It s not lawful except to take a swallow. It is of no \nuse in quenching thirst. Indeed, it increases thirst.  \n \n29.6d Skins of carrion  \n \nThere is no harm in using the skin of a carrion animal if it \nhas been tanned but you cannot pray on it nor can it be \nsold \n  \nBy tanning its smell and moisture is removed. It is understood \nthat it is a precondition that it is not used before it is tanned. It \nappears from his words that the tanning is used for the skins of all \ncarrion as Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. It is well-known that \ntanning is not used for pigskin. It is also apparent from his words \nthat its purity is general to aquatic and other animals, and that it \nis the case with Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. \nThe well-known position is that its purity is confined to dry \nanimals. Water alone is what clarifies aquatic animals . However \nthe prayer is not performed on that in the well-known position. It \nis not sold according to one of two transmissions which is well-\nknown in the School.  \n \n29.6e Skins of wild animals  \n \nThere is no harm in doing the prayer on skins of wild \nanimals or selling them if they have been killed correctly \n  \nThis means it is permissible. This refers to every animal whose \nflesh is disliked and so it includes elephants, wolves, foxes, and \nhyenas provided that they are slaughtered. They can also be sold.  \n \n29.6f Wool and hair of carrion \n  \nYou can use wool of a carrion animal or its hair or any \nother thing which could be taken from the animal when \nalive, but according to us it is better for it to be washed \nfirst \n  \nAfter shearing and it refers for general use in selling, praying on \nit, giving it as sadaqa and other things. If it is sold, the fact that it \nis from carrion should be made clear. It is clear that his words, \n\"and its hair\" includes the bristles of pigs. That is the case \naccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. It is said that the hair of \npigs and dogs are excluded and others say that all of pigs are \nimpure except the hair. The Malikis recommend that wool and \nother things be washed if you are not certain that they are pure. If \nyou are certain that something is pure, it is not recommended to \nwash it. If you are certain it is impure, it is obligatory to wash it.  \n \n29.6g Feathers, horns, teeth, hooves, tusks  \n \nYou cannot use feathers from birds which are carrion or \nthe horns, hooves and teeth of carrion animals. It is \ndisliked to use elephant tusks although there is a \ndifference of opinion about this \n  \nThis would appear to contradict his words \"or what is taken from \nthem when alive.\" He removes the specification by his words, \"or \npain them.\" It is clear that it is prohibition because life makes it \nallowed.  \n \nThe dislike of the use of elephant tusks is found in the \nMudawwana. But there is disagreement about it as about horn \nand antlers. There are four positions, and the well-known of them \nis that all of it is impure based. Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that it is pure. What is confirmed is that elephant \ntusks are impure since it is carrion. The position of the \nMudawwana is to dislike oils found in the tusks of elephants, \ncombing with it, and trading in it because it is carrion. As for the \ntusks of elephants slaughtered, even as a camel, that is disliked, \nand the dislike is for encourage restraint.  \n \n29.6h Liquids in which a mouse dies  \n \nAny ghee, oil or liquid honey in which a mouse has died \nshould be thrown away and not eaten although there is no \nharm in using such oil for lighting purposes provided it is \nnot in a masjid, in which case it should be carefully \navoided \n  \nIt is not sold. Similar to a mouse is any breathing creature. \nLiquids are thrown away and not eaten However it can be used for \nlight in places like houses and shops. It is not used in masjids \nbecause it is impure and the masjid lamps are not lit by it since \nthey are free from impurities.  \n \n29.6i If the substance is solid  \n \nIf the substance is solid, then the mouse should be thrown \naway along with what is around it and the rest may be \neaten, although Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthis was the case only if it had not stayed in it a long time, \notherwise all of it should be thrown away \n  \nHe can sell it although he must make that clear. There is no set \namount which is thrown away. That is according to predominant \nopinion. If it is in it a long time, then the impurity may have \nspread throughout it.  \n \n29.6j Food of the People of the Book  \n \nThere is no harm in the food of the people of the Book and \ntheir slaughtered animals \n  \nHe means it is permissible. Allah azza wa jall says, \"And the food \nof those given the Book is lawful to you.\" Most commentators say \nthat what is meant is all slaughtered food is lawful, what is lawful \nof that and what is unlawful, like when the slaughtered animal \nhas a bad lung. There must be permission to eat if the Kitabi is \none of those who does not consider carrion lawful. If he considers \nit lawful, Shaikh al-Bakri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if is \nslaughtered in your presence and then it is permitted to eat it. If \nhe is absent from it, it is not permitted.  \n \n29.6k Fat of animals slaughtered by Jews  \n \nHowever, it is disliked to eat the fat from animals \nslaughtered by Jews although it is not actually haram \n  \ni.e. what is forbidden them by their Shari‟ah, like the fat of cows \nand sheep like the fine fat which covers the intestines. If it is said \nthat the fat which are the Jews are forbidden by our Shari‟ah is \nnot unlawful, the answer is that it is a slaughtered part and what \nis slaughtered is lawful for him and he did not slaughter for other \nthan what is lawful for him. Because it is prohibited for him it is \ndisliked for us to eat it.  \n \n29.6l Animals slaughtered by Magians  \n \nIt is not permissible to eat animals slaughtered by Magians \nalthough any of their food that does not involve \nslaughtering is not haram \n  \nThis refers to idolater in general, whether an idolater slaughters \nfor himself or for a Muslim unless he commands him to sacrifice \nand tells him, \"Say, 'In the name of Allah' over it'. That can be \neaten without disagreement.  \n \nSimilarly one does not eat the sacrifice of the drunk or mad \nperson, even if they carry out the slaughter, because of the \nabsence of their intellect. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"It is valid when done by the discriminating child, and \nthe woman without necessity in the soundest position.\" It is \npermitted to eat unslaughtered food by agreement if he is certain \nof its purity. If he is certain of its impurity, it is unlawful to eat it. \nIf he doubts it, he considers it impure.  \n \n29.7 Hunting  \n \n29.7a Hunting for sport is disliked  \nHunting for mere pleasure is disliked but any other kind of \nhunting is permissible.  \n \nHunting is obligatory if he can only provide for his family by it.  \n \n29.7b Prey killed by a trained dog or falcon  \n \nAny prey killed by your trained dog or falcon can be eaten \nif you sent it after it \n  \nIt is not particular these two, but applies to all animals which can \nbe trained to hunt and obey. It is not a precondition that falcons \nbe restrained unless the prey is a bird. It is enough that it obey \nwhen released. It is not a precondition that it accept confinement \nafter being released. It is a precondition for hunting animal that \nhe actually train it, even if it is an animal which does not \nnormally accept training, like a lion or tiger. It is a precondition \nthat the prey be seen or in a confined space like a cave or thicket \nwhich he knows about or which has no other exit. Otherwise it is \nnot eaten. It must be something whose flesh is eaten, even if it \ndifferent than he thinks as when he thinks it is a rabbit and \nreleases his dog and it is a gazelle. It is a precondition that the \nhunter make an intention and say the tasmiya when releasing the \nanimal. If he neglects it intentionally, the game is not eaten but \nnot if he forgot and he is Muslim. This is for land hunting. As for \nfishing, it is permitted for everyone who is sane. It is not valid \nfrom a mad person or drunk.  \n \n29.7c Prey killed out of sight \n  \nThe same applies if your hunting animal kills any prey out \nof sight before you are able to slaughter it. If you reached \nthe prey before it has been killed it can only be eaten if you \nslaughter it \n  \nIt must be slaughtered. If he does not neglect it, it is eaten, even if \nhe does not carry out its killing since there must be bloodletting, \neven on the ear when the skin is thick.  \n \n29.7d Killing game with a spear or arrow  \n \nYou can eat anything you kill with a spear or arrow but if \nyou get the chance to slaughter it you should do so \n  \nAll that has a point, even if not iron, whether it is killed outright \nor dies of its wound. You can eat it because of your intention and \nbasmala when you shot. It is desirable to slaughter it if you find it \nstill alive.  \n \n29.7e Game that runs off  \n \nYou can still eat an animal even if it runs off, provided you \nare sure that it is your arrow that has killed it as long as \nyou reach it before nightfall. Some say that this refers only \nto prey that has been killed by trained hunting animals. If \nyour arrow is found piercing a vital organ you can eat the \nanimal \n  \nIt says in the Mudawwana that if the night passes and he finds it \ndead, he does not eat it, whether that is through a dog, falcon or \narrow.  \n \n29.7f Domestic animals killed like game  \n \nYou cannot eat a domestic animal which has been killed in \nthe way game is killed \n  \nThis is clear, even if it is a stray and has joined wild animals. It is \nthe same if the wild animal becomes tame. It is only eaten by \nsacrifice.  \n \n29.8 The 'Aqiqa  \n \n29.8a The 'Aqiqa is recommended  \n \nSacrificing an animal for the birth of a child ('Aqiqa) is a \nrecommended Sunnah. It should be done on the seventh \nday after the birth of the child, using a sheep similar in age \nand characteristics to what has been previously mentioned \nconcerning sacrifices for the ‘Id. The day on which the \nchild is born is not counted as one of the seven days. The \nanimal should be sacrificed in the morning \n  \nThe word derives from the hair of the head of child because it is \nslaughtered when the hair is cut. It is also said that it is because \nits veins are cut. It is recommended, not stressed. The basis for its \nlegality is what Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) related with \nan excellent isnad: the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Every child is in pawn for his 'Aqiqa.\" It is done for a boy or a girl \nprovided the child lives to the seventh day. It should be a sheep or \na goat without any defects which would prevent its sacrifice. The \nday he is born is not counted, unless he is born at Fajr, in which \ncase it is counted. It should be done in the morning and it is \ndisliked to do it from midday to sunset, and it is not allowed to be \ndone at night or before sunrise.  \n \n29.8b The child is not smeared with blood  \n \nThe child should not be smeared with any of the animal's \nblood \n  \nTo avoid the custom of the Jahiliyya which was to rub the head \nwith the blood for luck so that he might be courageous and blood-\nshedding.  \n \n29.8c What is done with the meat  \n \nIt can be eaten and given away as sadaqa and its bones can \nbe broken \n \ni.e. it is recommended for the people of his house and neighbors to \neat from it. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"Feeding people is the same as is done in sacrifices and there is no \nspecific amount which is given to people. He eats what he wishes \nand gives as sadaqa what he wishes, although sadaqa is more \nfitting since it is said that there is no 'Aqiqa until all or some of it \nis given as sadaqa.\" The aim of the 'Aqiqa is sadaqa and sadaqa \ncan be raw or cooked. It is recommended to break its bones as \nopposed to the Jahiliyya when they did not break its bones out of \nfear that it would affect the child.  \n \n29.8d Shaving the baby's head  \n \nIf the baby's head is shaved and the weight of hair in gold \nor silver given away as sadaqa that is a good practice \n  \nMale or female. This is based on a hadith of 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) in Shaikh at-Tirmidhi where the Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did an 'Aqiqa for al-Hasan (radhi‟Allahu anhu) with a \nram and said, \"Fatima, shave his head and give sadaqa in silver \naccording to the weight of the hair.\" It was weighed and it was a \ndirham or part of one. The fact that it is \"good\" means that it is \nrecommended. It is recommended that it he be named on the \nseventh day if there is an 'Aqiqa, and if there is no 'Aqiqa, the \nchild is named before that. It is recommended that something \nsweet go first to the stomach of the child because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) did that for 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) using a date.  \n \n29.8e Rubbing the head with other than blood  \n \nIf, instead of being rubbed with blood as was the custom \nbefore Islam, the baby's head is rubbed with a lotion \nconsisting of perfume mixed with rose water, there is no \nharm in this \n  \nBased on what is related by Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nfrom Burayda (radhi‟Allahu anhu) the Companion. He said, \"In \nthe Jahiliyya when one of us had a son, he would sacrifice a sheep \nand rub the head with its blood. When Allah azza wa jall brought \nIslam, we used to sacrifice a sheep and shave his head and rub it \nwith saffron.\"  \n \n29.9 Circumcision  \n \n29.9a Male circumcision  \n \nCircumcision is a confirmed Sunnah for males  \n \nIt is mandatory. It is disliked to be circumcised on the day of birth \nor the seventh day because it is the practice of the Jews. \nCircumcision should be performed before the time when he is \ncommanded to pray – from seven years to ten. There is \ndisagreement about whether or not to circumcise an adult who \nbecomes Muslim and fears for himself. Shaikh Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that circumcision is obliged for him, \nsaying, \"If it is mandatory to cut off the hands of thieves, is it left \nfor fear of himself?\" Someone who foregoes circumcision without \nexcuse is not allowed to be Imam or to give testimony.  \n \n29.9b Female circumcision  \n \nand \nfemale \ncircumcision \n(khifad) \nis \npraiseworthy \n(makruma) \n  \nTo remove what the woman has of excess. It is recommended \naccording to Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is worthy \nbecause it brightens the complexion and makes intercourse \npleasurable. \n  \n \n \nChapter 30: On Jihad \n \n \n30.1 Its meaning  \n \n Linguistically jihad is derived from jahd, which, according to al-\nMisbah, is effort in what someone does, or juhd which is ability. It \nis a technical term for the Muslim fighting the unbelievers who \nhave no treaty with the intention of elevating the word of Allah \nazza wa jall or presenting Islam.  \n \nJihad has obligations which must be met. They are:  \n \nObeying the ruler and so when he recommends going in a \nparticular direction to fight, it is binding to go there.  \n \nGhulul (misappropriation) must be abandoned: it means to take \nfrom the booty before it is divided.  \n \nHe must honor a safe-conduct pledge, and so when an unbeliever \nis granted safe-conduct, he must abide by it and he is not \npermitted after that to deem it lawful to kill him.  \n \nOne must not flee when the odds are two to one: which means \nstanding firm in the fray.  \n \nJihad has two categories; individual obligation and general \nobligation. When it becomes a specific duty to do it and it cannot \nbe opposed, whether if the person is one of those who are \nresponsible for the obligation of jihad or not, like the slave and \nchild who cannot fight and women, as when the enemy arrives \nsuddenly in the place and only these people are available, then it \nis an individual obligation for them. \n  \n30.2 How and when it is obligatory  \n \n30.2a An obligation  \n \nJihad is an obligation which can be taken on by some of \nthe people on behalf of others \n  \nBy the words of the Almighty: \"Those believers who stay behind – \nother than those forced by necessity – are not the same as those \nwho do jihad in the way of Allah.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:95) Allah azza \nwa jall has promised both good, i.e. the best reward which is the \nGarden. There is mutawatir Sunnah that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) sent some people rather than others.  \n \n30.2b Inviting people to Islam first  \n \nAnd it is preferable, according to us, that the enemy are \nnot fought until they have been invited to the din of Allah \nazza wa jall except if they attack first \n  \nThe Malikis prefer that each group be called upon to abandon \ntheir disbelief and be called to the shahadah whose contents are \nnot prescribed. He calls to the general message of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) for three days in succession unless \nthey attack first. Then the call is not recommended. Indeed, it \nbecomes obligatory to fight them.  \n \n30.2c Offering a choice between Islam and jizya \n  \nThey can either accept Islam or pay the jizya (tax on non-\nMuslims); if not they are to be fought  \n \nHis apparent words mean that they are given a choice between \nthe two at the same time. If they accept one, they are left. \nOtherwise they are fought. Al-Jawhar describes the call as Islam \nbeing offered to them. If they answer, they are left. If they refuse, \nthen jizya is offered to them, If they refuse, they are fought. All of \nthat is when there is a delay and there is time. If they attack \nbefore the call, preventing our call, they are fought because then \nthe call is unlawful.  \n \n30.2d Where jizya is acceptable  \n \nJizya is only acceptable in places where they are subject to \nour law. If they are a long way from our jurisdiction jizya \ncan only be accepted from them if they move to our \nterritory. If they do not do this they are to be fought \n  \nAbdullah \nibn \n'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) \nsaid \nthat \nthis \nprecondition is about the people of force. As for the people of truce, \nit is not a precondition for them. Jizya is accepted from them \nwhere they are because they restrained themselves until they paid \npeace for themselves and their lands.   \n \n30.2e Fleeing from the enemy not allowed  \n \nFleeing from the enemy is a major wrong action when their \nnumber is twice that of the Muslims or less \n  \nThis is when the unbelievers are twice that of the Muslims in \nstrength or stronger, or the business is not known. It is the well-\nknown position when they are considered weak according to the \nnumber, not the force, as opposed to Shaikh ibn al-Majishun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He says that they must be established as \nmore than twice the number if they are superior to the \nunbelievers in weapons and stronger in strength and resolve. The \nprohibition against flight is when he flees and does not intend to \nreturn. If he does that as a trick or to join another group so that \nthe enemy sees the retreat and follows him and he returns or he \nrejoins the amir or the group of the Muslims to help them, then it \nis not unlawful.  \n \n30.2f When flight is allowed  \n \nIf there are more than that there is no wrong in doing so \n  \nIf there are more than twice the number of Muslims, there is no \nharm in flight. Such it would appear, even if the Muslims number \nas many as 12,000, which is in an-Nawadir from Shaikh Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated from a group of the people of knowledge and he thinks that \nwhen the Muslims reach 12,000, they are not permitted to flee, \neven if the unbelievers are more than twice their number.  \n \n30.2g Fighting under any commander  \n \nThe enemy are to be fought whether the commander of the \nMuslims is right-acting or not \n  \nIt is obligatory for those for whom jihad is obligatory to fight the \nenemy. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah azza \nwa jall will support his din by the impious man.\" Perhaps if he \ndoes not fight with him, there might be harm for the Muslims.  \n \n30.2h Killing prisoners  \n \nThere is no harm in killing an enemy prisoner but you may \nnot kill anyone after a pledge of security has been given, \nnor may you break a treaty \n  \nWhen there is benefit in killing him. After security is given by the \nImam or someone else in the well-known position, contrary to the \none who says that security given by other than the Imam is \ndependent on the view of the Imam. The basis of the well-known \nposition is the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nabout a banner being set up for the treacherous on the Day of \nRising, when it will be said, \"This is the betrayal of so-and-so.\" It \nmeans that he will be known as treacherous on the Day of Rising \nso that the people there will censure him. Nor is a treaty to be \nbroken.  \n \n30.2i Not killing women and children  \n \nNor may you kill women and children  \n \nSince that prohibition is sound from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam). Similarly jizya is not imposed on them. The Imam can \ngive them choice between three: enslavement, freedom and \nransom.  \n \n30.2j Monks and priests and women who fight  \n \nKilling monks and priests should be avoided unless they \nare involved in the fighting. Similarly, women who fight \ncan also be killed \n  \nThe prohibition against killing monks is not by virtue of their \nmonasticism, because they are further from Allah azza wa jall \nbecause of the strength of their disbelief. They are left since the \npeople of their din leave them and so they are like women. Priests \n(rabbis) are left unless they actually fight. It is said that this \nrefers to women and children as well. Women can be killed if they \nare involved in the actual fighting. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) limits this to the state of fighting. When \nfighting is over, women are not killed. The predominant opinion is \nthat when women fight with weapons, they can be killed during \nthe fighting or afterwards, even if they did not fight anyone. \nAccording to the Mukhtasar, monks and nuns retain their \nfreedom, and it is forbidden either to kill them or to reduce them \nto slavery.  \n \n30.2k pledge of security  \n \nA pledge of security given by the least of the Muslims is \nbinding on the rest of then \n  \nThis security is granted to specific people, i.e. specific unbelievers. \nThe people of a region or town are not granted security except by \nthe ruler. If someone else makes such a contract, the ruler can \nbreak it if he wishes. We read in al-Jawahir, \"The precondition of \nthe security is that there is no harm in it for the Muslims. If \nsomeone grants security to a spy or scout or one who contains \nharm, it is not binding.\"  \n \n30.2l Women and children giving security  \n \nThis also applies when women do this, and also children \nprovided they are able to understand what is involved. It is \nalso said that this is only acceptable if the man in charge \nsays it is acceptable \n  \ni.e. if the child knows that it is unlawful to violate security, then \nhe is obliged to observe it.  \n \n30.3 Booty  \n \n30.3a The fifth  \n \nWhen the Muslims gain booty by having fought and won it, \ntheir leader takes one fifth and divides the remaining four-\nfifths between those doing the fighting. It is better for this \ndividing up to take place where the battle was fought \n  \nHe divides the fifth as he thinks best. He can put it in the \ntreasury or spend it on the welfare of the Muslims by buying \nweapons or other things beneficial for the Muslims. If he likes, he \ncan give it to the family of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) or others or give part of it to them and the rest to others. \nThis is when they take booty other than land: horses, linen, \nslaves, money and grain. Land is not divided in fifths or allotted. \nIt is entailed and its land-tax is spent on the best interests of the \nMuslims. After the fifth is taken, the rest of the booty is divided in \nthat place where the fighting took place since the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) did that because it is a punishment for the \nenemy.  \n \n30.3b Which booty is divided  \n \nOnly booty that has been fought for using horses and \ncamels or taken after combat is to be divided up in this \nway \n  \nAs for what is taken without combat or force, like that which is \ntake from the one who people have left when they hear that the \nMuslim army has advanced against them, there is no fifth nor \ndivision. It is at the discretion of the Imam as he can dispose of \nthe fifth of the booty wherever he wishes.  \n \n30.3c Use of food or fodder  \n \nIf part of the spoils consist of food or fodder, there is no \nharm in any who need it taking some before the division \ntakes place \n  \nThis means it is permitted with or without the permission of the \nleader. What is meant by food is what can be eaten: meat or other \nthings. The basis for what he said is found in the Sahih in the \nwords of Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \"We used to get \nhoney and grapes in our raids and we ate them and did not \npresent them to the commander. The four-fifths of the booty is \ndivided between the army according to the preconditions in the \nShari‟ah.  \n \n30.4 Distribution of shares  \n \n30.4a Those actively involved in jihad  \n \nA share of the booty is only given to those who take part in \nthe fighting or who are prevented from doing so by being \noccupied with the jihad in some other way \n  \nAn active presence is meant, whether fighting or being present to \nface the enemy. When the rows are formed and fighting has not \nbegun, there is no share for someone who dies then, but there is a \nshare for the one who dies after the fighting stops. Also those who \nare prevented by things like scouting or bringing equipment or the \nlike receive a share. There is a share for the one who gets lost \nfrom the army in enemy territory.  \n \n30.4b If someone is ill  \n \nAnyone who falls sick is given a share as is any horse that \nfalls sick \n  \nIf he becomes ill after or during the fighting, i.e. he is present \nhealthy at the beginning of it and then becomes ill and continues \nto fight while ill. If he becomes ill before being present at the \nfighting, whether his illness began in enemy territory or Muslim \nterritory, he has no share. If the horse goes lame after fighting or \nduring it, it has a share. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nsaid, \"It has no precondition, and that is the same if it becomes ill \nby for some other reason.\"  \n \n30.4c The share of the horse \n \nA horse gets two shares  \n \nThis is the horse and not the camel, mule and ass which have no \nshare. It is limited to one since he spends more for its provision \nand has no share.  \n \n30.4d The share of the rider  \n \nand a rider gets one share \n  \nThere is allowance of what is not ridden. The rider is said to the \nrider of camels. As for the rider of horses, he is called a horseman. \nThe basis in what is mentioned is that it is sound that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) gave the horse two shares and the \nrider one share.  \n \n30.4e Slaves, women and children  \n \nSlaves do not get a share nor do women nor do children, \nunless the children are really able to fight, have been given \npermission by the Imam, and do actually participate in the \nfighting in which they are given a share \n  \nFreedom is a precondition to receive it, and so the slave, whether \nhe fights or not, does not get a share. He must be male, so the \nwoman does not get a share, whether she fights or not. He must be \nan adult, so the child does not get a share except with three \npreconditions: that child who has not reached puberty is able to \nfight, has the permission of the Imam and actual participated. \nShaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmits from the \nMudawwana that it is explicitly stated as well-known that he has \nno share, whether he fights or not. The literal meaning of the \nhadith indicates lack of shares. The hadith quoted by Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did not give a share to slaves, women or children.  \n \n30.4f Servants  \n \nA hired servant is not given a share unless he actually \nfights \n  \nHe must go out with the intention of jihad, especially the one \nwhose uses are owned, like the hired servant, and like the general \nhireling in the lack of the share. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) makes a distinction about those who actual fight.  \n \nThree preconditions remain: sanity, Islam, and health. The \nmadman has no share by agreement. The Dhimmi has no share by \ndisagreement if he does not fight or does fight in the well-known \nposition.  \n \n30.4g When the enemy becomes Muslim and has Muslim \nproperty in his possession \n \nIf anyone from the enemy becomes a Muslim and has in his \npossession property previously belonging to the Muslims, \nthat property remains in his possession. If anyone buys \nany of it from him it becomes theirs and the original owner \ncan only get it back by paying the correct price for it \n  \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is clear from his \nwords that if he becomes Muslim with free Muslims in his \npossession, they are taken from him, and it is the well-known \nposition. According to him he is not recompensed for this. If a \nMuslim buys something in the abode of war, be it the property of \nMuslims or that of the dhimmis, it belongs to him, and the owner \ncan only get it back by paying the price which he paid for it if it is \nlawful to own. If it is something unlawful to own like wine and \npigs, its owner takes it without buying it.  \n \n30.4h Rights of the original owner  \n \nIf property of this kind is divided up as part of the booty \nthe original owner of a particular piece of property has the \nfirst right to it provided he pays the correct price for it \n  \nThis is if he finds it with someone who bought it from the booty. If \nhe finds in the share of someone or who is ignorant of the price, he \nonly takes it for the price connected the right of the other to it.  \n \n30.4i Claiming it before division  \n \nIf the division has not yet been made he can reclaim his \nproperty without having to pay anything for it \n  \nHe means when the Muslim or the Dhimmi finds his goods in the \nbooty before the division has taken place and has clear evidence of \nownership, he takes it without paying anything, but only after \ntaking a legal oath that he did not sell it, give it away, nor was it \nremoved from his property by legal means. Thus it is still be his \nproperty.  \n \n30.4j No one receives more than his basic share  \n \nNo one is permitted to receive more than their allotted \nshare unless it is given by the leader at his discretion from \nthe fifth apportioned to him and this cannot be done \nbefore the basic division is made \n  \nThis is based on what Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated about the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) allotting \nextra from the fifth at the Battle of Hunayn. This extra is only \nallotted after the division. On this basis, allotting it before the \ndivision is only conceivable by a promise. For instance he says, \n\"Whoever has killed someone has whatever is taken from the \ncorpse.\" These words can imply prohibition or dislike, i.e. the \nImam or general of the army is prohibited from saying this before \nhaving power over the enemy because that might lead to the \ninvalidation of their intentions because some of them expose \nthemselves to death for the sake of the goods of this world, and \nthen he would fight for the reward. After the fighting, that does \nnot need to be guarded against.  \n \n30.4k Arms, clothing and personal effects of the enemy  \n \nThe arms, clothing and personal effects of enemy soldiers \nkilled in the battle is treated as part of the fifth that can be \ngiven away at the leader's discretion \n  \nThe Imam only gives them from the fifth according to his \ndiscretion. Pickings are what are found with the dead person: \nclothes, weapons and similar equipment rather the dead idolaters \nhave of bracelets and crowns. It is like that with money. These \nthings are not part of pickings in the well-known school, i.e. as \nopposed to Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) who includes \nthe bracelets, crowns and money in the pickings.  \n \n30.5 Forts (Ribat)  \n \n30.5a Their excellence  \n \nGuarding a frontier post is an action of great excellence, \nwhich increases in virtue  \n \nLinguistically ribat means to reside, and in the Shari‟ah it means \nto reside at the frontiers in order to defend them. It includes \nmoney and other things, the Dhimmi and the Muslim. Guarding \nother things is a consequence of guarding the frontiers. The \nfrontier is the place where there is a possible defensive weakness.  \n \nIt is related that ribat is better than jihad based on what is in the \nSahih where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Ribat \none day in the way of Allah azza wa jall is better than this world \nand what is in it.\" It is better because the bliss of the Next World \nremains and does not run out, and also because ribat is in order to \npreserve the blood of the Muslims, and preserving their blood is \nbetter than shedding the blood of the idolaters.  \n \n30.5b The amount of danger  \n \naccording to the amount of danger experienced by the \npeople manning that post and the amount of caution they \nhave to take \n  \nThis excellence varies. It according to the number of the enemy, \nfear and caution. Fear increases caution.  \n \n30.6 Raids  \n \n30.6a Permission of parents  \n \nYou cannot go on jihad without the permission of your \nparents  \n \nIf they are both Muslims according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and with Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) in general whether they are Muslims or unbelievers.  \n \n30.6b A surprise attack  \n \nunless the enemy makes a surprise attack, raining your \ntown, in which case it is obligatory for you to put up a \ndefense. In such case parents' permission is not required \n  \nIf there is a sudden attack on the people of a certain town, then \nthe people of the town have to defend it. It is obligatory for the one \nwith a father or without, slave or free. In this slaves have shares \nbecause they are called on to perform jihad because when we \ndenied them a share, it was because it was not their \nresponsibility. It is now is their responsibility as mentioned in at-\nTahqiq. He mentioned that it is obligatory for those near them to \nhelp them. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he does not \nask for his parents' permission in such a case, since it has become \nan individual obligation like hajj, the prayer and individual \nseeking knowledge because he is obliged to obey them in \nabandoning permissible and supererogatory things, not specific \nobligations.  \n \n \nChapter 31: On Oaths and Vows \n \n \nThis deals with what is permitted in oaths and vows and what is \nnot permitted or binding. It means with kaffarah (expiation) of the \noath and swearing. The yamin (oath, right hand) is real in the \nlimb and metaphorical in other contexts. It is said that the yamin \nis the limb and the oath is called yamin because when they made \noaths, one of them strike the other persons right hand with his \nright hand. So it was called an oath.  \n \n31.1 The form of an oath  \n \n31.1a Oaths are by Allah azza wa jall \n \nAnyone who swears an oath should do so by Allah azza wa \njall \n \nHe should swear by the name of Allah azza wa jall, not by the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) or anything else which is \nesteemed in the Shari‟ah or one of His attributes, like Oneness, \ntimelessness and existence.  \n \n31.1b Not making an oath  \n \nor keep quiet \n  \nHe should keep quiet unless he makes a proper oath since he is \nnot swearing by Allah azza wa jall. He is forbidden to swear by \nother than Allah azza wa jall since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Allah azza wa jall forbade you to swear by your \nfathers. Whoever takes an oath, should swear by Allah azza wa \njall or be silent.\" So he commands the silence for what is other \nthan oath by Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n31.1c Oaths involving divorce or emancipation  \n \nAnyone who swears an oath to divorce a wife or free a \nslave is to be punished for doing so although he still has to \nhold to his oath \n  \nThis is when he is adult and has knowledge and deliberately \nmakes such an oath. That impairs his testimony, It is clear from \nhis words that he is punished, whether he breaks the oath or not. \nAccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) the punishment is \nnot defined but is up to what the ruler thinks best: beating, \ncursing, or the like, which can vary with different people. In \naddition to punishing someone who makes an such an oath, he is \nobliged to carry out the oath he made about divorce or freeing \nwhen he breaks the oath. If he unsure whether he broke it or \nsuspects it or thinks it probable, he has broken it in the well-\nknown position. If he doubts whether he said,  \"You are divorced\" \nor not or is unsure about whether he made an oath and broke it or \ndid not make an oath and did not break it, he does nothing.  \n \n31.1d \"If Allah wills\" is not said in the oath  \n \nNo one should make an oath containing the safety clause, if \nAllah wills \n  \nThis is not done.  \n \n31.1e No kaffarah for oaths in which Allah is not \nmentioned  \n \nThere is no kaffarah (expiation) except for an oath made \nusing the name Allah or one of His other names or \nattributes \n  \nKaffarah is pointless otherwise. It is also done if he uses a name, \nlike the Almighty or the Creator, or one of His essential \nAttributes, like knowledge, power, will, hearing, seeing, and \nspeech and life. As for actions like provision, an oath is not made \nby them. The literal meaning of his words is that \"Allah willing\" \nhas no force when connected to divorce, as when he says, \"If I \nenter the house, you are divorced, Allah willing.\" Shaikh ibn al-\nMajishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if he means an action, \nlike entering the house, it has force. The position of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it does not apply, even if he \nmeans the action. When he enters the house, then the divorce \noccurs. It is that which is believed by Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), and is the well-known position.  \n \n31.1f Saying it at the same time as the oath  \n \nIf someone does use a safety clause he does not have to do \nkaffarah as long as he intends the provision and says \n'Insha'Allah' at the same time as he makes his oath. If this \nis not the case such a provision bears no weight \n  \nWhen he swears by Allah azza wa jall or one of His attributes, he \ndoes not have to do kaffarah with three preconditions.  \n \nHe must have meant the provision, i.e. intended to dissolve the \noath without any difference in the aim is that it was before the \noath, during it or after he finishes, then it applies as Shaikh at-\nTata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) states. If he does it without intention, \nas out of forgetfulness or for blessing, it does not dissolve the oath.  \n \nHe must say \"Allah willing\"; the intention alone is not enough.  \n \nIt must be connected to the oath before it. So if he is silent more \nthan enough necessary for a breath or sneezes. If he is forced to \nstop, there is no harm.  \n \n31.2 Kinds of oaths  \n \nThere are four kinds of oaths which can be sworn by Allah \nazza wa jall \n  \n31.2a Oaths for which there is kaffarah  \n \nYou do kaffarah for two of these; namely, if you swear by \nAllah azza wa jall, \"If I do such-and-such a thing, I will do \nsuch-and-such a thing\", or if you swear by Allah azza wa \njall, \"I will do such-and-such a thing\"  \n \nOne of the two is that the oath in the promise to perform a good \ndeed. The first is when he swears that he will do something or not \ndo something, and then if he fails to do, he has broken it.  \n \n31.2b Oaths for which there is no kaffarah  \n \nThe two kinds you do not do kaffarah for are firstly when \nyou make an oath about something, thinking at the time it \nis true and later realizing that it isn't. In this case you do \nnot do kaffarah, nor is there any wrong action involved \n  \nThe first category is when you think that it is true. This does not \nmean that you think it is probable. What is meant is feeling \ncertain, not it being unequivocal according to the evidence, but \nthen later the opposite becomes clear. This is what he believes to \nbe true. Belief is strong assumption. If it is not strong, then there \nin lack of clarity or even doubt. He owes no kaffarah and there is \nno sin involved since Allah azza wa jall says, \"Allah will not take \nyou to task for inadvertent statements in your oaths, but He will \ntake you to task for oaths you make intentionally.\" (5:89) We read \nin the Mudawwana, \"There is no inadvertency except in the oath \nby Allah azza wa jall or a vow which cannot be avoided, ' i.e. the \nunclear vow, as when he says, \"If I do this, then I have a vow\" and \nthe inadvertent has no effect in divorce, setting free or an unclear \nvow.  \n \n31.2c Oaths for which there is no kaffarah  \n \nThe other kind is if you swear an oath about something \nknowing it to be untrue or having doubt about it. In this \ncase there is a wrong action involved but no kaffarah \n  \nA doubtful oath is one, for instance, where you swear that you met \nsomeone the previous day but you did not meet him or are unsure \nabout it. Doubt is weak supposition. So he swears to a lie or is \nunsure, and so he definitely sins, even if what he swears is true. \nBut there is no kaffarah if it is connected to the past. If it is \nconnected to the present or future, there is kaffarah. It is like that \nwhen the inadvertent oath is connected to the future. If it is \nconnected to the past, there is no kaffarah.  \n \n31.2d Repentance in any case  \n \nYou must, however, do tauba to Allah azza wa jall, on \naccount of it \n  \nBecause it is one of the major wrong actions and you should draw \nnear to Him with what you can do of freeing slaves, sadaqa and \nfasting.  \n \n31.3 Kaffarah  \n \nKaffarah for oaths consists of  \n \nThere are four types of expiation. There is choice between three \nforms feeding, clothing or freeing, and fourth follows the lack of \nability to do either of the three: it is fasting. The best of the them \nis feeding which is why he began with it. \n  \n31.3a Types  \n \n31.3a1 Feeding  \n \nfeeding ten needy people, who are Muslim and free, giving \none mudd to each measuring by the mudd of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam), but according to us it is \nbetter to increase that by a third or a half \n  \nFrom this is clear that feeding has five preconditions  \n \nNumber (ten) and so it is not allowed to give it to more or less, nor \nto one several times. When he gives five people two mudds each, \nhe gives to five and completes it with another five people. He can \ngive a larger amount provided that it remains in the possession of \nthe poor and he does not destroy it. The time of paying it must be \nmade clear that it is kaffarah. If he feeds twenty people half a \nmudd, that is not allowed.  \n \nThat they are poor, If he gives it to rich people knowingly, that is \nnot allowed.  \nThat they are Muslims. If he gives it to the poor of the dhimmis, it \nis not allowed, as is the case with zakat. \n  \nThat they are free. If he gives it to a slave, that is not allowed.  \nThat what is given of the mudd to each poor person is by the mudd \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  and it not allowed \nwith anything else.  \n \nTwo things can take the place of the mudd: two ratls of bread with \nseasonings of oil or yogurt, or meat. As for feeding them lunch and \ndinner, or two lunches or two dinners, and to have lunch or \nsupper, that is not enough, even if it reaches a mudd. We think it \nbetter to increase give more than a mudd.  \n \nYou add a third or a half according to what the prevailing \nstandard of living is and whether the price of staples at the \ntime is high or low. However if you only give one mudd \nregardless of these considerations, you have fulfilled the \nobligation.  \n \nThis is based on the medium standard of life and the type of grain \nusually eaten, no matter what the price. Any a mudd in any land \nand in every time without adding to it satisfies it because it is the \nobligation.  \n \n31.3a2 Clothing  \n \nIf you give clothing you should give a man a robe and a \nwoman a robe and a head-covering \n  \nIf he chooses clothing, then he clothes ten poor people. There is no \ndifference between the child and the adult in giving the clothing \nand support. It is not a precondition that the clothing be from the \nmiddle of its people because Allah made that a precondition in \nfood but not clothing.  \n \n31.3a3 Freeing  \n \nKaffarah can also be done by freeing a believing slave  \n \nThey stipulate preconditions in it. One is that the slave is a \nbeliever, and so an unbeliever is not adequate. The second is that \nthe slave is free of faults which would impair him, like blindness, \nsenility. As for that which does impair, it is allowed. The third is \nthat it is someone who has firm ownership after buying, and not a \nconditional purchase. The fourth is he has full ownership, and is \nnot shared, The fifth is that there is no contract to purchase \nfreedom.  \n \n31.3a4 Fasting  \n \nbut if you cannot do this or feed people, then you should \nfast three consecutive days although if you do them \nseparately, you have still fulfilled the obligation \n  \nIf all three are impossible, then there is fourth course which he \nindicates. It is recommended to fast for three consecutive days \nbecause it is hurrying to discharge responsibility. If the three are \nseparate, then it is still correct, but there must be an intention \nmade each night.  \n \n31.3b When kaffarah is obliged  \n \nYou can do kaffarah either before or after failing to fulfill a \nvow, although doing it afterwards is preferable according \nto us \n  \nThis appears to be generally applicable, whether the oath is for an \nact of piety or on account of failing to do something, like kaffarah \nfor the fast or something else, but it is preferable to expiate it \nafterwards.  \n \n31.4 Vows  \n \n31.4a Which vows must be fulfilled  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow involving obedience to Allah \nazza wa jall must fulfill it whereas anyone who makes a \nvow involving disobedience to Allah azza wa jall must not \nfulfill it and no reparation is necessary \n  \nLinguistically Nadhr means making something binding, and in \nthe Shari‟ah it is to oblige oneself to do something which is an act \nwhich brings one near Allah azza wa jall. There are two \ncategories: a vow involving obedience which must fulfilled, and a \nvow involving disobedience which must not be fulfilled. When it is \nnot obligatory to fulfill it, according to Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) there is kaffarah for it, but that is not the \nposition of the majority, as he stated here.  \n \n31.4b Vows made respecting other people's property  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow to give sadaqa with someone \nelse's money or to free a slave belonging to someone else is \nnot under obligation to fulfill it \n  \nHe owes no sadaqa or freeing in that which has no precondition. If \nit is connected to a precondition, then he must do it when the \nprecondition exists according to the famous position, like, \"I would \nfree so-and-so if I owned him.\"  \n \n31.4c Fulfilling the vow  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow that if he does a particular thing, \nhe will do a specific good action, such as praying or fasting \nor going on hajj or 'umra, or giving away something \nspecific as sadaqa, must do what he said he was going to do \neven if he fails to fulfill his vow straight away \n  \nWhether it is obligatory or forbidden, and so he binds himself to do \nwhat he vowed what he stipulated. This is when he mentions a \nspecific thing with his tongue or in his heart and it is a pious \naction. The unlawful and permissible are excluded and so a vow \nwhich does not involve a good action would not be binding. So in \nthe case of sadaqa, he may name an amount or simply make an \nintention connected to worship and ability. That is then binding. \nHe must carry it out, even if he did not intend an amount. If it is \nprayer, then it is the least of that to which the name prayer \napplies, which is two rak'ats. In the case of fasting, when it is not \nspecified, it is the minimum which can be fasting is applied, which \nis a day. If he says, \"If I speak to so-and-so, then I must walk to \nMakka,\" then it is obliged for him to walk on hajj or 'umra. As for \nsadaqa, if he does not name anything, he must give a third of his \nproperty. If he names, then the literal meaning of his words is \nbinding, even if it is all his property. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said. \"If he mentions his house and it is all \nthat he has, then he must do that.  \n \n31.4d When the vow is not accompanied by an oath  \n \nThis is the case even if his vow is not backed up by an oath \n  \nIt is binding.  \n \n31.4e An unspecified vow  \n \nIf anyone makes a vow without specifying a particular \ngood action to be done if he fails to fulfill it, and then does \nfail to fulfill it, should atone for it by doing the kaffarah for \noaths \n  \nIf he does not name anything specific in his vow so that it can be \nachieved, as when he says, \"By Allah, I have made a vow\" without \nsaying whether it is prayer, fasting, hajj or the like, he owes \nkaffarah for an oath in the School.  \n \n31.5 Oaths and vows to do wrong  \n \n31.5a There is no reparation for a vow to do a wrong action  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow to do a wrong action such as \nkilling someone or drinking wine or something similar, or \nto do something which is neither a good action nor a \nwrong action, does not have to make any reparation for \nfailing to fulfill it, but should seek forgiveness from Allah \nazza wa jall \n  \nOr something permissible or disliked. He does not have to do \nkaffarah.  \n \n31.5b Kaffarah for such oaths  \n \nIf anyone swears by Allah azza wa jall to do a wrong action \nhe should do the kaffarah for oaths and not do the thing he \nswore to do. However, if he is so bold as to do the thing he \nswore to do he has committed the wrong action but does \nnot have to do the kaffarah for breaking his oath \n  \nIf he swears by the name of Allah azza wa jall or one of His \nattributes, then he should do kaffarah. If he does not action \nwithout concern for its consequences, then he does not have to \nperform kaffarah.  \n \n31.6 Kaffarah for various oaths and vows  \n \n31.6a When there is a double kaffarah  \n \nAnyone who says in his oath \"By the pact of Allah and His \ncovenant\" and then fails to fulfill it has to do a double \nkaffarah  \n \nBecause the covenant is an oath and the pact is an oath. If he \ncombines them, he swears two oaths. What he mentions differs \nfrom the famous position which is found in at-Tawdih that the \nkaffarah is not repeated when the oath-taker intended to stress \nthe oath or it was unintentional.  \n \n31.6b A single kaffarah  \n \nHowever, anyone who emphasizes his oath about one \nspecific thing by repeating it only would have to do a \nsingle kaffarah \n  \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said when the oath is \nrepeated on the same thing, it is not a new oath, if the aim is \nrepetition, i.e. there is not another kaffarah. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-\nSalam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said he means that when he swears \nto someone by one of the Names or Attributes of Allah and then \nrepeats the oath by that specific Name or Attribute connected to \nthat specific thing. If he intends a second oath to stress the first or \ndoes not have an intention, he does not have to do the kaffarah \nagain. If he intended multiple kaffarah, then it is agreed that it is \nmultiple. If he intends to formulate and is not alluding to a \nmultiple kaffarah, then the famous position is that it is not \nmultiple. It is understood that it as about one thing. If, for \ninstance, he repeats it about two things, he owes the kaffarah of \nan oath for each, as when he says, \"By Allah, I will not speak to \nso-and-so, and by Allah, I will not eat from this food, and by Allah, \nI will not wear this garment.\"  \n \n31.6c Oaths for which there is no kaffarah  \n \nAnyone who says, \"I am a mushrik,\" or that he is a Jew or a \nChristian if he does such-and-such, does not have to make \nany reparation and nothing is binding on him except that \nhe must seek Allah azza wa jall’s forgiveness  \n \nI seek refuge with Allah - or any similar sort of expression. He \nowes no kaffarah because it was not by any of the Names of Allah \nor His Attributes and so does not entail a binding oath. He must \nonly repent and no shahadah is demanded of him. Of course, \nasking forgiveness is an act of devotion to Allah azza wa jall, like \nemancipation, sadaqa and fasting.  \n \n31.6d No kaffarah for making something lawful unlawful  \n \nand anyone who makes something haram for himself \nwhich Allah azza wa jall has made halal does not have to \ndo kaffarah  \n \nIn the form of food or drink. He owes no kaffarah but must ask \nforgiveness for that sin because it is Allah azza wa jall who makes \nthings lawful and unlawful and he has criticized Allah by doing \nthat by the words of the Almighty, \"Say: 'What do you think about \nthe things Allah has sent down to you as provision which you have \nthen designated as lawful and unlawful?' Say: 'Has Allah given \nyou authority to do this or are you inventing lies against Allah?'\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 10:59) There are two exceptions to that.  \n \n31.6e An exception: divorce  \n \nexcept in the case of his wife who then does become haram \nfor him until after she has been through another marriage \n  \nThis is when someone says that his wife is haram for him. This is \nbecause making her haram amounts to a treble divorce and so she \nis not lawful for him until she has been through another marriage \nwhich has been consummated. If it has not been consummated, \nthen a treble divorce must have occurred in it unless he intended \nthe minimum. The second case is when he makes his slavegirl \nunlawful and intends to free her. By that she becomes unlawful to \nhim.  \n \n31.6f A vow to give away all of one's property  \n \nIf you make an oath or vow to give your wealth away as \nsadaqa or as a free gift [to the House of Allah] giving away \na third is sufficient to fulfill the oath \n  \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that if that that is \nthe case in an oath or vow and also when he does not name \nsomething specific. If he names it, it is binding on him, even if it is \nall of his property. This is also the case when he gives it to a \nspecific person like Zayd or the Banu Zayd: all of that is binding \nwhen he makes the oath unless he would be reduced and then he \nis left what a bankrupt is left.  \n \n31.6g A vow to sacrifice one's son  \n \nIf you make an oath to sacrifice your son, then if you \nremember what happened with Prophet Ibrahim (alaihi \nsalam) you should sacrifice an animal which should be \nslaughtered in Makka and the minimal sacrifice for this is \na sheep. If, however, the example of Prophet Ibrahim (alaihi \nsalam) does not enter your thoughts there is no need for \nyou to make any reparation \n  \nAs when you say, \"If I do not do such-and-such, I will sacrifice my \nson,\" and then recall the story of the Prophet Ibrahim (alaihi \nsalam) and his son, then you sacrifice an animal, a camel, cow or \nsheep, in Makka or at Mina if you stop at 'Arafat. It is said to be \nrecommended or obligatory, which is the more likely. The \nminimum is a sheep which is disliked if a larger animal is \npossible. It can be male or female. If you do not remember the \nstory at all, then there is no sacrifice or kaffarah, but you should \nask Allah azza wa jall's forgiveness.  \n \n31.7 An oath to walk to Makka  \n \n31.7a Such an oath is binding  \n \nIf you make an oath to walk to Makka and fail to do so it is \nstill binding on you to walk from the place where you made \nthe oath and it is up to you whether you go for hajj or \n'umra \n  \nAs when you say, \"If I do a certain thing, I will walk to Makka.\" If \nyou do that thing, then you must walk from the land in which you \nmade the oath, not from the place in which you resides, unless you \nspecified a place. You have a choice about whether it is in hajj or \n'umra when you did not intend either. That is the famous position: \nthere is a choice when there is no intention. The end of achieving \nthe oath in 'umra is after finishing sa'y. In the hajj it is after \nfinishing the Tawaf al-Ifada.  \n \n31.7b When riding becomes impossible  \n \nIf it becomes impossible for you to walk at any point you \nshould ride. But if you later become able to walk you \nshould walk that part of the journey where you rode. If you \nare certain you will not be able to fulfill the oath you stay \nwhere \nyou \nare \nand \nmake \na \nsacrifice. \nWhat \n'Ata' \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said about this is that you should not \ngo over any part of your journey a second time and that \nyou can sacrifice instead \n  \nThis oath is dependent on ability. If you become able to walk, then \nyou ride and later you can return and walk. If you know that he \ncannot, you make a sacrifice - preferably a camel, or a cow, or a \nsheep. If you do not know what you walked and what you rode, \nyou walk the whole way. If you know that you will not be able to \nwalk, you sacrifice and do not have to return again. 'Ata' ibn Abi \nRabah (rahmatullahi alaihi), one of the mujtahids, said that you \ndo not have to return again and the sacrifice takes care of it. This \nis part of the disagreement in the Maliki School in which there is \nchoice.  \n \n31.7c When someone who has not performed hajj makes \nthis vow  \n \nIf you have not yet gone on hajj [and it was not part of \nyour intention when you made the oath to walk to Makka \nto do so] you must do an 'umra first and when you have \nfinished your tawaf and sa'y and shorten your hair, you \nmay then go into ihram from Makka for the fard of hajj as \na mutamatti'. In any other case you should shave your \nhead but in this instance it is recommended to merely \nshorten the hair in order to retain an unkempt appearance \nduring the hajj \n  \nIf you not have not yet performed hajj when you make an oath to \nwalk to Makka, then it is mandatory that the walking be in 'umra, \nbased on what the Mukhtasar states, when there is no intention. \nWhen you have an intention, you walk as you intended. It is \nrecommended that after the tawaf, sa'y and shortening your hair, \nyou then assume ihram from the masjid according to the \nMudawwana or at its door according to Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Then you make the intention for the hajj of \nIslam, and you add 'umra to hajj if it is in the months of hajj. He \nshould shorten only shorten and not shave his hair in this case.  \n \n31.7d An oath to walk to Madina or Jerusalem  \n \nIf you make an oath to walk to Madina or to Jerusalem it is \nall right to ride to them if your original intention was to do \nthe prayer in either of the two masjids. If you meant \nsomething else you do not have to fulfill you oath at all \n  \nYou can walk to them in the well-known position. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that you must walk to them \nwhile Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Maziri \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others recommended that because it is \ncan act of piety which should be fulfilled. You are obliged to go to \nthem only if you intend an obligatory prayer - although some say a \nvoluntary prayer and retreat in their masjids. If you do not intend \nto pray, you owe nothing because walking itself is not worship.  \n \n31.7e An oath to walk to any other masjid  \n \nIf you make an oath to pray in any masjid other than one \nof these three, you should not go either walking or riding, \nbut you should do that prayer in the place where you are \n  \nWhether it is near or far based on what is reported in Muslim \nwhere the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Animals are \nonly saddled for three masjids: my masjid, the Masjid al-Haram, \nand the Masjid al-Aqsa.\"  \n \n31.8 A vow to man the frontier  \n \nIf you make an oath to man a post in any place on the \nfrontiers of Islam you have to do it \n  \nEven if he is one of the people of Makka and Madina. That vow \nshould be fulfilled because manning the frontier is an act of \ndevotion to Allah azza wa jall and if you vow an act of devotion, \nyou must fulfill your vow.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 32: On marriage, divorce, remarriage, \n'Dhihar'-repudiation, vows of celibacy within \nmarriage, mutual cursing (li'an), 'Khul'-\n'divorce, and suckling \n \n \nThese are eight things. The first, marriage, is the root and rest are \nconsequences. Each has a linguistic meaning and usage which we \nwill mention in its proper place. Marriage (nikah) linguistically \nmeans intercourse and is used as a metaphor for the contract. In \ntechnical usage, it is actual for the contract and metaphorical for \nintercourse. It is used in custom to mean intercourse as the \nAlmighty says, \"Until she marries a husband other than him,\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 2:230) and so it is known from this that nakaha is \nused for intercourse between any man and woman. Marriage in \nthe sense of intercourse is only permitted in the Shari‟ah by one of \ntwo matters: the contract of marriage or ownership by the words \nof the Almighty, \"those who guard their private parts – except \nfrom their wives or those they own as slaves, in which case they \nare not blameworthy.\" (Holy Qur‟an 23:5-6)  \n \nMarriage has four pillars: the wali, the place, the form and the \nobligatory dower.   \n \n32.1 Obligatory elements for the validity of marriage  \n \n32.1a A guardian  \n \nMarriage is not valid without a guardian [wali] \n  \nThere is no marriage contract except with a guardian. As Shaikh \nibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, the guardian is either her \nowner (in the case of a slave), or her father or male relative, or an \nagent or guardian, or the authority (the ruler) or someone who is \nMuslim.  \n \nPreconditions for that are being Muslim, free, adult, sane and \nmale. Integrity is not a precondition for the validity of the contract \nin the famous position, but part of its perfection, nor is common \nsense. So the fool can make a contract for his daughter with the \npermissible of his guardian according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). This is a precondition of validity and the \ncontract is not valid without a guardian by the statement of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"A woman does not give \nherself or another woman in marriage. The woman who gives \nherself in marriage is guilty of fornication.\" [as Daraqutni \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) who said that it is sahih and hasan.] If it \noccurs without a guardian, then the marriage is null and void both \nbefore and after consummation, even if she gives birth to several \nchildren. There are two transmission about whether the \nnullification is a divorce or not.  \n \n32.1b A dowry  \n \na dowry \n  \nThe dowry is a precondition for the validity of consummation \nbecause of the words of the Almighty \"Give women their dowry as \nan outright gift.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:4)  \n \n32.1c Two witnesses  \n \nand two legally acceptable witnesses \n  \nHaving two witnesses is also a precondition for the validity of \nconsummation, not for the contract. It is a precondition that the \ntwo witnesses of the marriage be reputable, based on what Shaikh \nibn Hibban (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted in his Sahih: the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no marriage \nexcept with a wali and two legally acceptable witnesses.\" Marriage \nwithout those preconditions is invalid according to the hadith. If \nthere are no legally acceptable witnesses, then there should be a \nlot of witnesses, like 30 or 40.  \n \nOne of the preconditions of the validity of the contract is the form \nof the contract from the wali and husband or agent. The guardian \nmust use an expression which would entail permanent transfer \nlike \"I have given to you in marriage\". The husband must use an \nexpression which entails acceptance, like \"I have accepted.\" The \norder is not a precondition, but is recommended. If the husband \nspeaks first and then the guardian speaks after him, the contract \nis sound as long as the two responses are immediate; a slight \ndifference does not impair the contract as opposed to a major \ndifference. This would be, for instance, if a man who is ill were to \nsay, \"If I die from this illness, I have given my daughter in \nmarriage to so-and-so,\" and then dies a month later, and the \nhusband accepts the contract after his death. The marriage is not \nvalid.  \n \nNOTE: A marriage is contracted by the acceptance and answer, \neven if it was intended a joke on both sides because marriage is a \nserious matter.  \n \n32.1d Witnesses must be present at the contract  \n \nIf these two are not present to witness the actual making \nof the contract, it is not permissible for the couple to \nconsummate their marriage until the witnessing has taken \nplace \n  \ni.e. the guardian and husband. In one text, it has the singular, \nmeaning the husband. If it is consummated without witnessing, \nthe marriage is invalidated with a final divorce and they receive \nthe hadd-punishment if they did not make it known and do not \nhave the excuse of ignorance and admit intercourse. If they make \nit known, there is no hadd, especially they have a feast, drums \nand one witness.  \n \n32.1e Minimum amount of dowry \n  \nThe smallest acceptable amount for a dowry is a quarter of \na dinar \n  \nThat by which the contract becomes valid. The dinar is of pure \ngold and in silver it is three dirhams of pure silver. It can be an \nequivalent value in goods. There is no maximum because the \nAlmighty says \"Give one of them a qintar.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:20)  \n \n32.2 The authority of the guardian  \n \n32.2a A father arranging the marriage of a virgin daughter \n  \nA father can arrange the marriage of his virgin daughter \nwithout her permission even if she is beyond the age of \npuberty. It is up to him whether he consults her or not  \n \nTo whomever he wants for the dowry he wishes, even for less than \na suitable dowry. He can give her choice, and it states in al-\nJawahir and elsewhere that it is recommended that he ask her \npermission.  \n \n32.2b Someone other than the father arranging the \nmarriage of a virgin  \n \nHowever, if anyone other than the father is arranging the \nmarriage of a virgin, such as a guardian appointed in the \nfather's will or anyone else, he cannot give her in marriage \nunless she is beyond the age of puberty and has given her \nconsent. In this case her silence is taken as consent \n  \nIt says in the Mudawwana that an orphan is not given in \nmarriage by her guardian until she comes of age and gives \npermission. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"unless \nthere is a will from the father to marry her to a certain person and \nthen he acts in loco parentis. There is a text in the Mukhtasar \nwhich states that the guardian as the same position as the father \nin compulsion to marriage with two preconditions. One is that he \nthe husband is specified and the other is that the father \ncommands that. The Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) states after \nthis, \"The girl is not married unless her father commanded that \nshe be married.\" What he mentioned about other relatives than \nthe guardian, like the grandfather and brother, is known in the \nSchool.  \n \n32.2c A woman who has been married before  \n \nA woman who has already been married cannot be given in \nmarriage, by her father or anyone else unless she herself \nagrees to it and gives verbal consent  \n \nWhen she is adult, sane and free and has not lost her virginity \nthrough injury or fornication, be she sensible or foolish, by her \nfather or anyone else. It is limited to the adult instead of the child \nwho loses her virginity before becoming an adult. Her marriage is \nnot dependent on her consent. \"Sane\" excludes the mad woman. \nHer father can compel her, even if she has children. The judge can \nalso compel the adult mad women if she has no father.  \n \nWhat is mentioned about asking her permission is by word, as \nImam \nMalik \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nImam \nash-Shafi‟i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and Sahih Muslim transmitted, \"The widow \nis more entitled to herself than her guardian, and the virgin is \nasked for consent for herself, and her consent is her silence.\" What \nis meant by the widow is the non-virgin. The difference between \nthe two is the shyness which is found more fully in the virgin \nrather than the non-virgin. It is reported from Shaikh ibn al-\nQassar (rahmatullahi alaihi) that modesty has ten parts: nine in \nwomen and one in men. When a woman marries, a third of it goes. \nWhen she gives birth, two-thirds is gone, and if she fornicates, it is \nall gone.  \n \n32.2d The necessity of the consent of the guardian  \n \nA woman can only be married if she has the consent of her \nguardian or someone suitably qualified from among her \npeople, such as one of her male relations, or the governor \n  \nOr her agent since a guardian is a precondition for the validity of \nthe contract - there is no disagreement about that with us - or \nwith the permission of someone qualified, which means those who \npossess the preconditions of guardianship which are: being male, \nfree, sane, adult, not in ihram, and not a unbeliever for a Muslim \nwoman. The ruler acts in default of such a person.  \n \n32.2e Lowly women  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion regarding lowly women \n(daniyya) as to whether they can have a guardian that is \nnot related to them or not \n  \nThis is the woman who has neither beauty, money nor position. \nWhen she has beauty, money or position, she is noble. Position is \nlike lineage and descent, or a noble father.  \n \nA guardian who is not related is a Muslim, i.e. he is not a \nguardian nor one qualified from her family nor a client nor a ruler \nwhen there is a particular guardian. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that she is permitted to appoint him \neven when there is a relative. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that that is not permitted unless there is no relative. \nSo the two Shaikhs agree on the validity but differ about when \nthis can be done. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat it is valid although disliked, which is the reliable position, \nwhile Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is not.  \n \n32.2f Order of precedence in matrimonial guardians \n  \nA woman's son has more right to be her marriage guardian \nthan her father and her father has more right than her \nbrother. After this the nearer the relationship the greater \nthe right \n  \nThe son is a closer relative because he is the most entitled of her \nrelatives after her father. The father is more entitled than the \nbrother (full or half) because the brother is not as close as the \nfather and the father will debar him from inheritance.  \n \n32.2g The marriage is valid when the more distant acts as \nguardian  \n \nHowever, if the more distant relative acts as guardian the \nmarriage is nevertheless still valid \n  \nEven when a nearer relative exists, like the brother. The marriage \nis valid because the order between them is only about suitability. \nDiffering from it is only disliked provided the marriage is with an \nequal. If the husband is not an equal, then it is obliged for the \ncloser relative to reject the marriage, even if the woman is pleased \nwith it. If he does not reject it, it is presented to the ruler, i.e. it is \nobligatory to reject it and she is not permitted to consent. It is \ninvalid.  \n \n32.2h A guardian appointed in a will \n  \nA guardian appointed in a will can arrange the marriage of \na male child under his guardianship  \n \ni.e. he can compel him to marry, like the father, when that has \nbenefit, like marrying him to a rich or noble woman.  \n \n32.2i The limitations of such a guardian  \n \nbut he cannot arrange the marriage of a female child \nunless the father has given him specific instructions to do \nso \n  \nAnd if he has specified the husband, when he says \"Marry her to \nso-and-so.\" According to the Mukhtasar, it is enough that he \ncommands her to compel her to marry that he can marry her to \nwhomever he wishes.  \n \n32.2j Agnate relatives  \n \nMale relatives on the maternal side are not considered \nsuitable as marriage guardians who should rather come \nfrom the paternal side  \n \nTo act in giving in marriage, whether they are heirs like the \nbrothers by the mother or not, like the maternal uncle. The \nguardians come from the paternal side, the stronger being \nadvanced first. So the full brother comes before the half brother by \nthe father. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"It is \nclear from his words that the guardian is only one of the paternal \nrelatives, and there is a contradiction when he says 'someone \nsuitably qualified from among her people, or the governor.' The \nreply is that the what is meant here about the relative being only \nfrom the paternal relatives does not preclude the one who is not a \npaternal relative being a protector or ruler, and so it is relative.  \n \n32.3 Competition between suitors  \n \nNo one should propose marriage to a woman if another \nproposal has already been accepted, nor should anyone try \nto outbid his brother, if an agreement has already been \nreached \n  \nAccording to what Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"The expression means a prohibition.\" This is to propose when \nthere is an outstanding proposal and to bid when there is an \noutstanding bid provided an agreement has been reached between \nthe couple of the parties to the bid. In respect of marriage, this \nmeans that the couple incline to one another so that only the offer \nand its acceptance remain. In the sale it is a precondition that the \nmoney be weighed, for instance, and the goods free of faults. If he \nsees a fault, he can return it.  \n \n32.4 Forbidden types of Marriage  \n \n32.4a The Shighar marriage  \n \nA 'Shighar' marriage - which is when there is a direct \nexchange of daughters without any dowry - is not \npermitted \n  \nThere are three types of forbidden marriage. Shighar is to \nexchange one woman for another. The basis for its prohibition is \nfound in the Muwatta' and two Sahih collections where the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade the Shighar. It is \nderived from lifting, as when a dog lifts its leg to urinate or when \na person lifts their leg for copulation. It is also used from a land is \ndevoid of people. It is used for exchanging women without a \ndowry. The pure Shighar is that a man gives his daughter in \nmarriage to a man provided that he marries his daughter to him \nwith no exchange of dowry. The woman whose marriage is \nconsummated \nreceives \nan \nappropriate \ndowry \nand \nthe \nunconsummated has nothing.  \n \n32.4b Marriage without a dowry  \n \nneither is marriage without a dowry \n  \nIf they stipulate that it be dropped. If that happens, then it well-\nknown that it is nullified before consummation, and she receives \nnothing. There are two positions about whether its nullification \namounts to a divorce. After consummation she receives a suitable \ndower and the child is connected to him and there is no hadd-\npunishment because of the dispute.  \n \n32.4c Temporary marriage  \n \nnor is temporary marriage - which is marriage for a \nspecified, limited period \n  \nBy consensus. This is found in Khalil, the Mudawwana and \nelsewhere, whether it is a short or long term such that the person \nwill not live that long. Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that it is marriage with a dowry, guardian and witnesses \nwhich is unsound by setting a term, and its judgment is that it is \nalways invalid without a divorce. If anyone marries a woman in a \ntemporary marriage but does not enjoy her, it is permitted for his \nfather and son to marry her. There is no hadd for them, and the \nchild is attached to the father and she observes full „Idda. She \nreceives no dowry if it was voided before consummation. If it is \nafter that, she receives the dowry appropriate to her whether or \nnot a dower was stipulated for her.  \n \n32.4d Marriage during the idda  \n \nMarriage during the ‘Idda period is also forbidden  \n \nThis means forming a contract while she is in her „Idda, whether \nthat it for the death of a spouse or divorce, irrevocable or \nrevocable, based on the words of the Almighty, \"until the book \nreaches its term.\" The consensus on that if anyone forms a \ncontract with a woman during „Idda, it is nullified without divorce \nbecause it is agreed to be unsound. If it is consummated, they are \npunished as are the witnesses if they are aware of that. She \nreceived the named dowry and children are connected but the \ncouple do inherit from one another if one dies before it is nullified \nbecause the contract was unsound and she is always forbidden to \nhim. When there is only a contract which it is nullified, she is not \nforever forbidden and he can marry her after the „Idda is he \nwishes.  \n \n32.4e Marriage contracts containing uncertainty  \n \nas is any marriage involving uncertainty (gharar) in either \nthe terms of the contract or the amount of the dowry or \nany marriage in which the dowry includes anything whose \nsale is forbidden \n  \nLike marriage by choice, or where the dowry consists of an \nrunaway slave or runaway camel, or if the dowry is unlawful, like \nwine and pigs. If anyone of that occurs, then it is invalid before \nconsummation and she has no dowry. It is established after it with \nthe dowry of a women like her.  \n \n32.4f When there is a defect in the marriage  \n \nAny marriage which is invalid because of some defect in \nthe dowry should be dissolved before the consummation \ntakes place. However, if the marriage is consummated, it is \nconsidered valid and the man should then pay the dowry \nappropriate to the circumstances of the woman he has \nmarried \n  \nLike a marriage for what cannot be lawfully owned, like wine, or \nis permitted but not valid to sell, like a runaway slave. It should \nbe dissolved by divorce with no dowry. If she has taken it, she \nreturns it. If it is consummated, and only discovered afterwards, \nshe receives a suitable dowry for someone of her deen and lineage.  \n \n32.4g Defective marriage contracts after consummation  \n \nIf it is the contract that is defective but the marriage is not \ndissolved until after it has been consummated, the \nspecified dowry must be paid and any marriage bars \n(muharim) that would have applied if the marriage had \nbeen valid, still apply \n  \nThis is like a marriage without a guardian which is invalid before \nand after consummation. If it is voided before consummation, \nthere is no dowry. But if it has been, a specified dowry is paid or a \nsuitable dowry. When an invalid marriage is nullified, the bars to \nmarriage formed by it are still binding. just as would have been \nthe case in a valid marriage. If the marriage is nullified before \nconsummation, these bars do not occur unless some of the \npreliminaries to intercourse have taken place, like kissing and \nembracing.  \n \n32.4h Fake marriage does not permit remarriage  \n \nNor does such a marriage make it possible for a man to \nremarry a woman whom he has previously divorced with a \ntriple divorce \n  \ni.e. through an unsound marriage after it is agreed that it is \nunsound, even if intercourse occurs several times. As for a \nmarriage whose validity is disputed and she is divorced after \nconfirmed intercourse, then she is lawful based on the evidence of \nwhether there is intercourse or not. It achieves imposing bars \nagainst intercourse without making marriage lawful to be careful \non either side.  \n \n32.4i It does not entail being muhsan \n  \nNor do the two parties involved attain 'muhsan' status \n  \nBecause one of the preconditions of becoming lawful and muhsan \nis the validity of the contract. The correct position is that the \ncouple do not achieve muhsan status through an invalid marriage \nas we read in at-Tahqiq.  \n \n32.5 Forbidden degrees  \n \n32.5a Unlawful through blood relationship  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has made it haram to marry seven \ncategories of women through blood relationship and seven \nthrough suckling and marriage relationship. He says, may \nHe be exalted, \"Haram for you are your mothers and your \ndaughters and your sisters and your father's sisters and \nyour mother's sisters and your brother's daughters and \nyour sister's daughters.\" These are the ones who are haram \nthrough blood relationship \n  \n32.5b Unlawful through suckling or marriage relationship  \n \nThose who are haram through suckling or marriage \nrelationship are, as Allah azza wa jall says: \"Your mothers \nwho have suckled you and your sisters through suckling \n  \nThis applies whether the nurse is a virgin or non-virgin, even if \nnot yet of puberty, and even if it is a hermaphrodite, alive or dead, \nwhen there is milk in the breasts. The suckling can be once or \nseveral times. Mothers and sisters are the only two mentioned in \nthe Holy Qur'an: one is the root and one the branch to indicate \nthat it encompasses all.  \n \n32.5c Wives' mothers  \n \nyour wives' mothers \n  \nEvery woman who has a connection by birth to the wife, however \nhigh, whether he made a contract with her when he was adult or \nyoung. The majority of the people of knowledge say that it is \ngeneral whether or not the marriage was consummated. A \nmarriage contract with the daughter makes her mother unlawful. \nOther people like 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and ibn 'Abbas \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) say that \"those you have gone into\" is a \nprecondition for this and the step-daughter. According to their \nschool, when a man marries a woman and divorces her before \nconsummation, he can marry her mother.  \n \n32.5d Step-daughters  \n \nyour step-daughters living in your households, if you have \nconsummated your marriage with their mothers - if you \nhave not consummated it there is no harm in marrying \nthem \n  \nStepdaughters are the wife's daughter. No consensus about that is \nunderstood except what is related from 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nthat she is not unlawful when she is in the household. There is \ndisagreement \nabout \nconsummation. \nImam \nash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is intercourse while Shaikh al-\nBaydawi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it means to go behind a \ncurtain with them which is a well-known allusion to intercourse. \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it means enjoyment with touching, \nkissing, even if nothing happens from that.  \n \n32.5e Son's wives  \n \nthe wives of your sons who are born from your loins \n  \nHowever lows whether the marriage was consummated or not. \nThis applies to milk sons as well by agreement, based on what the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said: \"Suckling makes \nunlawful what lineage makes unlawful.\"  \n \n32.5f Two sisters at the same time  \n \nor being married to two sisters at the same time except if it \nhas already happened  \n \nWhether by marriage or ownership of if one is by marriage and \nthe other is a slavegirl. An exception is made regarding what has \nalready happened. If it happened before, and has been removed by \nIslam, Allah azza wa jall excuses it. Islam eliminates it but there \nis no punishment for it.  \n \n32.5g Father's ex-wives \n  \nAnd Allah azza wa jall also says, \"Do not marry any of the \nwomen whom your fathers married \n  \nWhether the marriage has been consummated or not. It is by the \ncontract that she becomes unlawful to the son. It is the same with \nthe ex-wife of the grandfather.  \n \n32.5h Milk causes marriage barriers  \n \nAnd the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) made suckling \nthe same as blood regarding the categories of relationship \nwhich are haram for marriage \n  \nThis is in the two Sahih collections. What birth makes unlawful, \nsuckling makes unlawful. The ayat which indicates the \nprohibition of being married at the same time relatives other than \ntwo sisters and the Sunnah adds further categories. Here he \nindicates here a prohibition made by the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam):  \n \n32.5i Being married to a woman and her aunt  \n \nAnd he also made it haram for a woman to marry a man \nwho is married to any aunt of hers \n  \nIt is transmitted in the Muwatta' and the two Sahih collections. \nThe precise rule is that it applies to every two women between \nwhom there is kinship and suckling which prevents them being \nmarried together, and so it is unlawful to be married to them both \nat the same time. If he is married to both of them, both marriages \nare always null and void, even if he has consummated the \nmarriage, without divorce or dowry for the one whose marriage \nhas not been consummated. If the first woman knows, then the \nsecond marriage is void and the first marriage is confirmed and \nthe marriage of the one who claims she is the second is nullified, \nbut it is by divorce. If the first knows of the second and the \nhusband does not claim knowledge about which marriage was \nfirst, both marriages are void.  \n \n32.5j The contract entails marriage barriers \n  \nWhen a man has married a woman, the existence of the \ncontract \neven \nwithout \nthe \nmarriage \nhaving \nbeen \nconsummated, makes that bride haram for his father and \ngrandfathers and his sons \n  \nThis bar is not based on intercourse. \n  \nIn the same way, the bride's mother and grandmothers \nbecome haram for him \n  \nThis explains the \"mothers of your wives\". By a contract with the \ndaughter, the mother becomes unlawful, whether the marriage is \nconsummated or not.  \n \n32.5k The case of the ex-wife's daughters  \n \nHowever, her daughters are not haram unless either he \nhas had sexual intercourse with her or has experienced \nphysical pleasure from contact with her, as a result of \nhaving married her or owned her as a slavegirl or the same \nthing having happened as a result of a doubtful marriage \nor ownership \n  \nEven by looking at other than her face or hands. In the case of the \ndoubtful marriage, such a contract does not make the daughter \nunlawful. Consummation, intercourse or enjoyment of her makes \nher unlawful. Looking at her face or hands, even with pleasure, \ndoes not. Enjoyment by sound marriage is evident. A case of \ndoubt, for instance, would be when the marriage is a fifth one, or \nshe is in „Idda without him knowing and he enjoys her, or he had \nintercourse with a woman thinking that she is his wife and so all \nthe branches of each of those women mentioned are unlawful for \nhim.  \n \n32.5l The effect of fornication  \n \nZina [fornication or adultery] does not make partners \nharam who would normally be halal \n  \nEven if this is multiple, it does not create the bar either in the root \nor the branch. It is lawful for him to marry her mother or \ndaughter as long as it is not his own daughter, who is unlawful to \nhim. That is the position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in \nthe Muwatta'. His evident words in the Mudawwana are different \nwhich says: if he fornicates with the mother of his wife or her \ndaughter he should divorce her. Most Shaikhs say that this \ndivorce is mandatory. So what is in the Mudawwana and the \nMuwatta' differ. Most Shaikhs prefer the Muwatta' and it is relied \non because all the companions of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) agree on it except Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Some prefer what is in the Mudawwana since Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned that Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he had retracted what was in the \nMuwatta' and said that it was unlawful.  \n \n32.6 Intercourse with non-Muslim women  \n \n32.6a Women who are not People of the Book  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has made it haram to have sexual \nintercourse with a kafir woman, not from the People of the \nBook, either through marriage or ownership \n  \nThis is for the Muslim. This is based on the words of Allah azza \nwa jall, \"Do not marry idolatrous women until they believe.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 2:221) Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nthis includes the Magians and Sabaeans who are the people who \ndeviated from Judaism and Christianity and worshipped the \nangels. It includes idolaters who actually worship idols and others \nwho worship other things like the sun and the moon.  \n \n32.6b Women of the People of the Book  \n \nIt is halal to have sexual intercourse with women of the \nPeople of the Book if you own them as slaves or are \nmarried to any of their free women, but it is not halal for \neither a free man or a slave to have sexual intercourse \nwith slave girls from among the people of the Book \nthrough marriage to them \n  \nThis is based on the ayat of Allah azza wa jall, \"or what your right \nhands own.\" We read in adh-Dhakira that because the People of \nthe Book have been honored by the Book and addressed by the \nAlmighty Lord, their women and food are permitted. Others lack \nthis honor by their deprival. It is reported from 'Abdullah ibn \n'Umar ibn al-Khattab (alaihi salat wa salam) that it is not \npermitted to marry a free Kitabi woman by evidence of the ayat of \nSura al-Baqara. He says, \"There is no shirk greater than her \nstatement that her Lord is 'Isa (alaihi salam).\"  \n \n32.7 Marriage to slaves and stepmother's children  \n \nA woman cannot marry her slave, nor her son's slave and a \nman cannot marry his slavegirl nor his son's slavegirl. He \ncan, however, marry his father's slavegirl and his mother's \nslavegirl \n  \nA man is permitted to marry his stepmother's daughter from a \nprevious marriage. \n  \nThis is clear when he had the daughter before the marriage and \nwas weaned. When he married her while she was nursing or the \nfather has divorced her and then she married a man and had a \ngirl, can the daughter of the first husband marry this girl or not. \nThere are three positions in that. The most likely of them is the \nprohibition and dislike out of caution. Then he mentioned the \nreverse of this question.  \n \nAnd a woman can marry her stepmother's son from a \nprevious marriage \n  \nBy other than her father. This is when her father marries her \nafter the child is weaned. If he marries her while she is nursing, \nhe is her step-brother by nursing.  \n \n32.8 Number and condition of wives  \n \nBoth free men and slaves are permitted to marry four free \nwomen whether Muslims or from the People of the Book. \nSlaves can marry four Muslim slave girls and free men can \nalso do this but only if they are afraid of committing zina \nand do not have the means to marry free women \n  \n32.9 A man's duties towards his wives  \n \n32.9a Equal treatment  \n \nA man should treat his wives equally \n  \nA man should be equitable with his wives, whether they are free \nor Muslim slaves or Kitabis. This obligation is indicated by the \nBook, Sunnah and consensus. As for the Book, it is the words of \nthe Almighty, \"But if you are afraid of not treating them equally, \nthen only one,\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:3) i.e. choosing one is a command of \nAllah Almighty to confine oneself to one if you fear injustice. This \nindicates that justice is obligatory. As the for the Sunnah, the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"If someone has two \nwives and is not fair between them, he will come on the Day of \nRising with one side lower than the other. The four Sunan relate \nit and the Community agree that it is obligatory. Whoever is not \nfair between his wives disobeys Allah and His Messenger (alaihi \nsalat wa salam). He is not permitted to be Imam nor is his \ntestimony accepted. The preferred position that he confines \nfairness to the spending the night. As for clothing and \nmaintenance, that is according to the state of each of them: the \nnoble is suitably provided for and the lowly is suitably provided \nfor. There is no obligation in intercourse, but it is forbidden for \nhim to hold back from one in order to be keen towards the other. \nThe division is a day and night or two days if the wives agree.  \n \n32.9b Maintenance and Housing \n  \nHe is responsible for their maintenance and housing to the \nextent that his means allow \n  \nThe husband, free or slave must maintain and provide for his wife, \nfree or slave, Muslim or Kitabi. The literal sense is that it is only \naccording to his situation. The well-known position is that her \nsituation is also observed and so his like spends for her like in \nboth his hardship and ease. It is the same with clothing. He \npermitted to give the price to pay for what he owes. He does not \nhave to eat with her. There is agreement that she can divorce him \nif he is unable to support her after some delay in the well-known \nposition. An opposite position is that he can be divorced without \ndelay which was mentioned by Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). His divorce is not an irrevocable one, even if the judge \nimpose it, but it is not valid for him to take her back unless he \nfinds some wealth which will enable him to be able to support her.  \n \n32.9c Rights towards slave girls  \n \nA man's slave girls and or a slave by whom a man has had a \nchild (umm Walad) are not allotted nights in the same way \nas his wives are \n  \n32.9d When he becomes liable for support  \n \nA man is not liable for maintenance until his marriage has \nbeen \nconsummated, \nor \nhe \nhas \nbeen \ncalled \non \nto \nconsummate his marriage, given that it is with someone \nwith whom sexual intercourse is possible \n  \nWhether she is an orphan or otherwise, free or slave, simply by \nthe contract in the well-known position. Maintenance is obliged by \ntwo things. One is consummation which means they are alone \ntogether whether there is intercourse or not, and whether or not \nshe is someone with whom it is possible to have intercourse since \nshe may have a physical impediment, and the husband is adult \nand they are not supervised. The second thing is when he is \ninvited to consummate it and the husband is adult and they are \nnot ill.  \n \n32.10 Marriage by proxy (tafwid)  \n \n32.10a Definition  \n \nMarriage by proxy is acceptable. This is when the husband \nand the guardian make a contract without mentioning a \ndowry  \n \nWithout dispute. It is related in the singular, i.e. the husband can \nmake it. The words of the author are true in two forms because \nwhen they do not mention the dowry, either they are explicit in \nthat by proxy as when he says, \"I marry you to my ward by proxy \" \nor like \"I have married you to my ward\" without mentioning the \ndowry. In both cases the marriage is valid. If they make an \nexplicit precondition that there is no dowry, then it is not \npermitted and it is invalid before consummation. \n  \n32.10b A dowry must be fixed  \n \nin which case the marriage cannot be consummated until \nthe amount of the dowry has been fixed \n  \nAppropriate to her status on the day of the contract because it \nobliges inheritance and other fixed rights of marriage and entitles \nhim to consummation, not by the contract nor by death. If one of \nthem dies, they inherit from one another. There is no dowry except \nby stipulation. Some of them say it is affirmed by death, but that \nit is weak.  \n \n32.10c Acceptance of the dowry  \n \nIf the stipulated dowry is appropriate to the status of the \nwoman in question she must accept it. However if it is less \nthan her due the choice is hers. If she does not want to \naccept it, the couple are separated \n  \nWhen the dowry is appropriate to her in the School, she must \naccept it. If it is less than the suitable dowry, as when he \nstipulates 50 dinars when a suitable dowry is 100, then she can \nchoose. If she is satisfied and is sane and a non-virgin, she can \nmake it binding as long as it is not less than a quarter of a dinar. \nIf she is not pleased with it, then they are separated with a final \ndivorce because it is before consummation.  \n \n32.10d When the dowry is suitable  \n \nIf she is satisfied with it, or if the husband makes the \namount to what is appropriate, then the marriage is \nbinding on her \n  \nBy adding more to what was stipulated when it did not reach a \nsuitable dowry, and he allots her a proper amount after allotting \nless, then it is binding.  \n \n32.11 Effects of Change of Religion  \n \n32.11a If one of them leaves Islam  \n \nIf either one of a married couple leaves Islam, their \nmarriage is invalidated and they automatically become \ndivorced \n  \nThis is by a statement of disbelief or entering another religion. It \nbecomes immediately invalid and there is a final divorce in the \nfamous position, i.e. it is invalid by divorce. If the apostate \nbecomes Muslim, then the marriage remains and there is no need \nfor a contract nor taking back because the tie still exists. If he is \nkilled while an apostate, the spouse does not inherit. If someone \nwho is not an adult apostasies, they agree that he is only killed \nafter becoming adult and being asked to repent. Because one takes \nnote of his apostasy, his slaughtered animal is not eaten and the \nprayer is not said over him.  \n \n32.11b Another opinion  \n \nalthough \nanother \nopinion \nis \nthat \nthe \nmarriage \nis \ninvalidated but no actual divorce takes place \n  \nAnother position is that the marriage is invalid without divorce, \nwhich is transmitted from ibn Abi Uways (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and \nIbn al-Majishun (radhi‟Allahu anhu). They are compelled to \nabrogate it by the words of the Almighty,\" Do not hold to the bond \nof the unbelievers,\" (Holy Qur‟an 60:10) i.e. there should be not \nbond or marital connection between them.  \n \n32.11c When a couple become Muslim  \n \nIf a non-Muslim couple both become Muslim their marriage \nremains valid \n  \nThis is whether they are Kitabis or others if they become Muslim \nbefore or after consummation, whether the marriage was with a \nguardian and dowry or not. The marriage is valid as long as there \nis no impediment, like lineage or milk. If there is such an \nimpediment then the marriage is invalid.  \n \n32.11d When only one person in a couple become Muslim \n  \nIf one of the couple becomes a Muslim, the marriage is \nautomatically invalidated, but no actual divorce takes \nplace \n  \nThis invalidation is without divorce in the famous position. They \ndescribe this question in its various forms. One of them is that the \nhusband is married to a Magian or the like who is not one of the \nPeople of the Book and he becomes Muslim and she does not soon \nafter, i.e. within a month. If the time is not long between the two \nof them becoming Muslim, like a month, the marriage is confirmed \nwhether it has been consummated or not.  \n \n32.11e When the wife becomes Muslim  \n \nIf the woman becomes a Muslim, her previous husband has \nthe first claim on her if he becomes a Muslim during her \n‘Idda period \n  \nIf she is a Kitabi or otherwise when the marriage has been \nconsummated. This is true even if he divorces her in the „Idda, as \nthe divorce of the unbeliever is not considered. If he becomes \nMuslim after the end of the „Idda, the marriage is not confirmed \nfor her because his Islam is like the revocable divorce and there is \nnot taking back after the end of the „Idda. If she becomes Muslim \nbefore her husband and the marriage has not been consummated, \nthen their situation is clear.  \n \n32.11f When the man becomes Muslim  \n \nIf the man becomes a Muslim and the woman is one of the \nPeople of the Book, their marriage remains valid \n  \nIf he becomes Muslim before her and she is one of the People of \nthe Book, the marriage is confirmed as long as there is no \nimpediment to its continuance like lineage or suckling or if he \nmarried her in „Idda, whether his Islam was before consummation \nor not.  \n \n32.11g If the woman is a Magian  \n \nIf the woman is a fire-worshipper (Magian) and becomes a \nMuslim straight after her husband, they remain married. If \nthere is a delay in her accepting Islam, separation takes \nplace \n  \nIf he becomes Muslim immediately as long as there is no \nimpediment. If she delays, they are separated. What the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says differs to what is in the Mukhtasar, \nwhich is that if she becomes Muslims after her husband without it \nbeing a long time between their becoming Muslim, the marriage is \nconfirmed. \"Near\" is defined as a month and the like.  \n \n32.11h Someone with more than four wives  \n \nIf an idolater who has more than four wives becomes a \nMuslim he must select four of them and separate from the \nrest  \n \nFour of those he is permitted to marry in Islam before or after \nconsummation, whether he had a multiple contract or several \ncontracts with them, whether they are first or last, whether they \nbecome Muslim with him or he becomes Muslim and they are \nKitabis. Choice is explicit. After the choice he is separated from \nthe others without divorce. The point of the dispute is that if he \nbecomes Muslim with ten wives he chooses four and separates \nfrom the rest.  \n \n32.12 Various impediments  \n \n32.12a Divorce by Li'an  \n \nIf someone divorces his wife by a curse (li'an) he can never \nmarry her again \n  \nHe adds in the Muwatta', \"If he denies himself, he is flogged with \nthe hadd and the child connected to him, but he cannot take her \nback.\"  \n \n32.12b Marriage during ‘Idda  \n \nThe same applies to a man who marries a woman during \nher ‘Idda period and consummates the marriage during it \n  \nNo matter what kind of „Idda it is. We limit the „Idda to being for a \nrevocable divorce because if he marries a finally divorced woman, \nand she is unlawful to the husband, it is abrogated and there is a \nhadd but she is not forever unlawful to him.  \n \n32.12c Marriage of slaves  \n \nIt is not permitted for a slave or a slavegirl to marry unless \ntheir master gives permission \n  \n32.12d Women not making a marriage contract  \n \nIt is not permitted for a woman, or a slave, or a non-Muslim \nto draw up a woman's marriage contract \n  \nBeing male, free and Muslim are preconditions for the validity of \nthe contract since the women is not permitted to undertake the \ncontract for herself let alone another woman. The unbeliever has \nno authority over a Muslim woman although he does over an \nunbelieving woman and can marry her to a Muslim or unbeliever.  \n \n32.12e Marriage to make re-marriage possible  \n \nIt is not permitted for a man to marry a woman in order to \nmake it halal for her to remarry a man who has previously \ndivorced her by a triple divorce \n  \nThis is when the motive for marriage to make re-marriage lawful, \nor he has that intention along with the intention of keeping her if \nhe likes her. What is considered is the intention at the time of the \ncontract. If that intention occurs at the time of consummation \nhere is no harm. This is based on the words of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam), \"Shall I tell you about the borrowed Billy-\ngoat'?\" They said, \"Yes, Rasulullah.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"That is one who makes a woman lawful.\" Then he (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Allah has cursed the one who makes a \nwoman lawful and the one for whom he makes her lawful.\" (ad-\nDaraqutni) He likens him to an animal and then he (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said that Allah cursed the two men for what they did in \nmaking her lawful for her ex-husband. \n  \nand if such a marriage did take place it would not make a \nremarriage of this kind valid  \n \nThat is because this type of marriage is void before and after \nconsummation Some of them make a distinction between a final \ndivorce with consummation and a suitable dowry. If the first \nmarries her with this marriage, it is invalid without divorce and \nthe husband, guardian, witnesses and wife are punished for \ncarrying a marriage designed to make re-marriage lawful.  \n \n32.12f Ihram precludes marriage  \n \nA man in a state of ihram can neither get married himself \nnor draw up a marriage contract for someone else \n  \nWhether it is hajj or 'umra. This is because it is valid that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The person in ihram \ndoes not marry or give in marriage nor propose.\" If there is \nmarriage or giving in marriage, it is always invalid before \nconsummation and so she receives nothing. If it is abrogated after \nit, she has the dowry because every woman with a consummated \nmarriage receives dowry.  \n \n32.13 Sickness  \n \n32.13a Serious illness precludes marriage, but the dowry is \npaid from the third  \n \nIt is not permitted for a man with a very serious illness to \nget married but if he does get married and consummates \nthe marriage, then his bride's dowry is the first thing to be \npaid from the third of his wealth he is permitted to leave \nas he wills \n  \nOr for a sick woman which may prove fatal. That is because he is \nrestricted in respect of his property and it is connected to all who \nhas a lien on it absolutely. It is clear that the marriage of a \nseriously ill person is not allowed, even if he needs a woman to \nlook after him. It is like that in one of the two famous positions. \nThe other position is that it is permissible on account of need. The \nmarriage is void before and after consummation.  \n \nThe preferred position is that it is nullified by divorce because \nthere is disagreement on it. If it is not consummated, she has \nnothing. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that the \nwoman whose marriage is consummated receives a suitable \ndowry. It is the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is clear \nthat she has the stipulated dowry, even if it is more than the \ndowry of a woman like her, from the capital, little or great.  \n \n32.13b Such a wife does not receive a fixed share  \n \nShe does not receive the fixed share of his estate which \nwould normally go to a wife \n  \nThis comes from the prohibition by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) against bringing in a new heir or removing one, and to \nact other contrary to its aim.  \n \n32.13c Divorce when ill  \n \nIf such a man divorces a wife, that divorce is binding on \nhim, but, if he dies from his illness, his wife still inherits \nfrom him \n  \nIt is divorce because he is sane and responsible, whether the \ndivorce is final or revocable. She does not inherit from him if the \ndivorce is treble. She inherits from him if its revocable as long as \nthe „Idda is not over. If he recovers from his illness and falls ill \nagain, she does not inherit from him because the restriction was \nremoved by health.  \n \nThis chapter is continued in the next page which deals with \ndivorce, 'Dhihar'-repudiation, (ila') vows of celibacy within \nmarriage, mutual cursing (li'an), 'Khul'-'divorce, and suckling.  \n \n(Continuation of Chapter 32)  \n \nDivorce, 'Dhihar'-repudiation, vows of celibacy within \nmarriage (ila'), mutual cursing (li'an), 'Khul'-'divorce, and \nsuckling  \n \n \nThe discussion on divorce begins. Linguistically it means \nreleasing, from your words, \"I released the camel,\" and it is a \ntechnical term for undoing the bond of marriage. It has four \npillars:  \n \nHusband  \n \nWife  \n \nIntention. If someone speaks of divorce without intention it does \nnot occur, i.e. if someone wants to speak about something else and \nhis tongue becomes tied and he utters divorce, that has no effect. \nIt is the same when someone is forced to divorce: unless he uses a \ndouble-entendre with full knowledge.  \n \nThe form, which is divided into the explicit, which has the \nexpression \"divorce\" and it does not require an intention, and into \nallusion, which can be explicit or probable. If it is probable, then \nhis claim about his intention and number is accepted. When, for \ninstance, he says, \"Go\" or \"Leave,\" and says that he did not intend \ndivorce by that. He swears to that and owes nothing. If he says, \"I \nintended divorce by that,\" it is binding. If he intended one or more \ndivorce, he acts by that. If he did not intend a number, three is \nobliged.  \n \nThe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) divided divorce into two \ncategories: innovated and Sunnah.  \n \n32.14 Divorce  \n \n32.14a Result of divorce  \n \nIf anyone divorces his wife by a triple divorce she is no \nlonger halal for him either by right of ownership or \nmarriage until she has married another husband \n  \nFree or slave, Muslim or Kitabi, consummated or not. This is \nbased on the Qur'anic ayat. What is meant by marriage by the \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) and in the ayat is intercourse which \nis indicated by the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) in the hadith about the wife of Rifa'a (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \n\"Not until you taste his sweetness and he tastes yours.\"  \n \nA precondition for the husband is that he is a Muslim. If he had \nbeen a Muslim married to a Jew or Christian and he divorces his \nwife three times and then she then marries a Jew or a Christian \nwho then divorces her, she is not lawful for the Muslim to marry.  \n \nHe must be an adult and maturity in intercourse is considered. If \nthe contract is made before maturity and there is no \nconsummation until he is an adult, then it is lawful. Intercourse \nduring menstruation or „Idda is not considered, nor is the \nintercourse of the one who makes lawful without mutual aversion \nin it and that there be a customary being alone together which is \nconfirmed by two women.  \n \nThe seclusion must be confirmed, Otherwise, she is not lawful. \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"even if the second \nconfirms the intercourse because they are suspected of doing this \nto allow re-marriage to the one who divorced her. \" Intercourse \nwith an unconscious woman or madwoman is not considered.  \n \n32.14b Triple divorce is an innovation  \n \nIt is an innovation (bid'a) to divorce a wife by a triple \ndivorce said on one occasion but if it happens it is \nnevertheless binding \n  \nThe command is contrary to that even though it did occur in the \ntime of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Part of that is \nthat he (alaihi salat wa salam) heard that a man had divorced his \nwife with three divorces together. He (alaihi salat wa salam) got \nup in anger and then said, \"Do you play with the Book of Allah \nazza wa jall while I am among you?\" However it is binding when it \nis done all at once.  \n \n32.14c Sunnah divorce  \n \nA Sunnah divorce is acceptable, which is when a man \ndivorces his wife by one pronouncement made while she is \npure, having not had sexual intercourse with her since she \nbecame pure and does not make a second pronouncement \nuntil her ‘Idda period is over \n  \nA divorce allowed by the Sunnah which is permitted is described. \nThis has four rules.  \n \nIf one of them is missing it is not Sunnah.  \n \n32.14d When he can take her back  \n \nHe can go back to her provided that she has not begun her \nthird menstrual period since the pronouncement of \ndivorce (assuming she has menstrual periods and is a free \nwoman). If the wife is a slavegirl who has menstrual \nperiods, he can go back to her provided she has not yet \nbegun her second period \n  \nHe can take her back because the marital ties continue between \nthem except for intercourse. Taking her back is with the intention \nand the statement, like \"I take her back,\" \"I keep her,\" or things \nwhich take the place of word like intercourse and foreplay, but \nthere must be an intention with the intercourse. Intercourse \nwithout the intention is not taking back.  \n \n32.14e If the wife does not menstruate \n  \nIf the wife has not yet begun to have menstrual periods or \nhas ceased to have them, he can divorce her at any time he \nwants and the same applies to a woman who is pregnant \n  \nVarious ages are given for the menopause. About \"any time,\" \nShaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It can even be after \nintercourse with her because such a divorce is in months which \nwould not entail lengthening the „Idda. It is the same with the \nwife with whom the marriage has not been consummated, even \nduring the time of her menstruation, since the reason for the \nprohibition is to avoid prolonging „Idda.  \n \n32.14f If the wife is pregnant  \n \nA man can go back to his pregnant wife up until the time \nshe gives birth, in the same way that he can go back to a \nwife who is having periods before the end of her ‘Idda \n  \nHe can take her back when the child is partially born. If it is \ncompletely born, then the „Idda is over and he cannot take her \nback. The „Idda ends by the miscarriage of a piece of flesh or a clot. \nIf the matter is unclear, and it is not known whether it was the \nfetus or congealed blood, one considers the hot liquid. The „Idda of \na woman with constant bleeding is a year: nine months are \nconsidered as freeing her and three are the „Idda. So the „Idda is \nactually three months. The „Idda of the post-menopausal woman is \nthree months. There is no difference in the „Idda of months \nbetween the free woman and slave.  \n \nThey disagree about whether \"period\" in the ayat means purity, as \nwith \nus \nand \nImam \nash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nor \nmenstruation with Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n32.14g Divorce during menstruation  \n \nIt is forbidden for a man to divorce his wife while she is \nmenstruating but if he does do so it is valid, but he is \ncompelled to take her back if her ‘Idda period has not \nfinished \n  \ni.e. she is not pregnant. If he does, it is binding because Abdullah \nibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) divorced his wife while she was \nmenstruating and as 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) about that and he (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Tell him to take her back and then keep her until \nshe is pure and then menstruates and then is pure. Then if he \nwishes he can keep her, or if he wishes he can divorce her before \ntouching her. That is the „Idda which Allah azza wa jall has \ncommanded for the divorce of women.\" The ruler commands him \nto take her back. If he refuses, he threatens him with prison. If he \nrefuses, he is imprisoned. If he refuses he is beaten.  \n \nMukhtasar: The same applies if he divorces her during lochia.  \n \n32.14h An unconsummated marriage  \n \nIf a man has not yet consummated his marriage he can \ndivorce his wife at any time  \n \nHe is permitted to do this in the famous position since she has no \n„Idda, but Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) forbids it in \nmenstruation because he considers the reason behind the ruling to \nbe an act of worship.  \n \n32.14i Results of pronouncing divorce  \n \nOne pronouncement of divorce ends the marriage and \nthree makes her haram for him until she has been married \nto someone else \n  \nWithout consummation because she has no „Idda. It is final. Three \nin one statement or what is like it is like the final or by repeating \nthe expression one after another.  \n \n32.14j The statement, \"You are divorced\"  \n \nIf a man says, \"You are divorced,\" to his wife that is \nconsidered one pronouncement unless he intended more \nthan that \n  \nIt is a clear explicit statement, and counts, even if it is a joke. If he \nuses an indirect term (\"You are free\"), divorce is only obliged by \nintention because it is an allusion. If he intends more, it is \nbinding.   \n \n32.15 Khul' Divorce  \n \nKhul' is a type of divorce which precludes any possibility \nof remarriage, even though it is not technically called a \ndivorce, and it takes place when the husband accepts \nsomething from his wife in return for her release \n  \n\"It is a divorce\" refutes the one who says that it is invalidation. \nAccordingly to the first, if he divorced her before, the khul' is two \ndivorces and is she is only lawful after another marriage. \nAccording to the second, he can take her back before she married. \nThe words \"no possibility of remarriage\" indicates the position of \nsomeone who thinks it is revocable and not final. He said, \"not \ntechnically a divorce\" indicates the one who says the khul' is not \ndivorce even though it is called divorce.  \n \n32.16 Formulas of divorce  \n \nIf anyone says to his wife, \"You are divorced once and for \nall,\" it is as if he had pronounced the triple divorce, \nregardless of whether the marriage has been consummated \nor not \n  \nSimilarly, if anyone says, \"You are no longer my \nresponsibility,\" or \"You are on your own,\" or \"You are \nharam for me,\" or \"Your rein is on your hump\" (i.e. you can \ngo wherever you like) that is also considered as a triple \ndivorce if the marriage has been consummated. If the \nmarriage has not been consummated the husband is asked \nto specify what he intended \n  \nOne takes note of custom in all this.  \n \n32.17 Rights of divorced women  \n \n32.17a Dowry in unconsummated marriages  \n \nWhen a woman who has been previously married is \ndivorced before the marriage has been consummated she \nreceives half her dowry unless she chooses of her own free \nwill to forgo it. If she is a virgin the decision is left to her \nfather and in the case of a slavegirl it is left to her master \n  \nWhich has been named for her by the words of the Almighty \"If \nyou divorce them before you have touched them but have already \nallotted them a dowry, they should have half the amount you \nallotted, unless they forgo it,\" meaning non-virgin sane women, \"or \nthe one in charge of the marriage contract forgoes it.,\"(Holy \nQur‟an 2:237) which is the father in his virgin daughter and the \nmaster in his slavegirl. This applies when the divorce is final or \nrevocable, and she is free or a Kitabi or a Muslim slave, \nconsummated or not.  \n \n32.17b A gift from the husband to the divorced wife  \n \nWhen a man divorces his wife it is recommended for him to \ngive her something by way of consolation although this is \nnot obligatory \n  \nA gift according to his situation, wealthy or not. He is not \ncompelled to do it, but it is recommended.  \n \n31.17c When the gift is not needed  \n \nIf the marriage has not been consummated but the dowry \nhas been paid, nothing need be given by way of consolation  \n \nShe has no gift because she takes half of the dowry while her \ngoods remain. It is understood that this is when she has no \nallotment, she has a gift, as we said.  \n \n31.17d In a khul' divorce  \n \nThe same thing applies when a woman asks or a khul' \ndivorce \n  \nBecause she paid some of her property to separate from her \nhusband, disliked or not. \n  \n32.18 Right of widows in a tafwid marriage  \n \n32.18a In an unconsummated tafwid marriage \n \nIf a man dies without having either paid over the dowry or \nconsummated his marriage, his wife receives her share of \nhis estate but does not receive any dowry \n  \nThis is agreed because us the contract of marriage if sound, it \nmakes inheritance between them sound. But she has no dowry in \nthe famous position. What is understood is that it is the same if he \nhas allotted her a dowry.  \n \n32.18b In a consummated tafwid marriage  \n \nIf the marriage has been consummated she should receive \na dowry appropriate for someone of her status if no \nparticular amount has been agreed beforehand \n  \nWhen he has not allotted her any dowry. She also inherits. This is \nbecause her goods are sold and so she has a suitable dowry. This is \nwhen she is sane and it permitted to agree to less than a suitable \ndowry.  \n \n32.19 Physical grounds for annulment  \n \n32.19a Physical grounds in respect of the bride  \n \nThe marriage contract can be annulled if a bride is found \nto be mad or suffering from leprosy or a disease of the \nvagina. If the man consummates his marriage to such a \nwoman in ignorance he must pay her dowry and then \nclaim it back from her father. The same applies if it was \nthe bride's brother who acted as her marriage guardian \n  \nThese are faults. A disease of the vagina is a blockage which \nprevents intercourse. There are various forms of this. It includes \nconstant vaginal bleeds which prevent full intercourse. A bad \nsmell from the vagina is another cause. If the marriage is \nconsummated, then he pays her dowry and seeks it from the \nfather.  \n \n32.19b A consequence of this  \n \nIf the marriage guardian is not one of her close relatives, \nthe man does not have to pay any previously agreed dowry, \nbut instead the bride receives only a quarter of a dinar (i.e. \nthe minimum possible dowry) \n  \nIf he is a cousin, and does not know about the fault and the \nmarriage is consummated, he owes nothing. If he knows about the \nfault, then he is liable for it like the relative. He does not have any \ncomeback against the distant relative, but the woman only has a \nquarter of a dinar.  \n \n32.19c Impotence  \n \nAn impotent man is allowed one year and if he is still not \ncapable of having intercourse the marriage can be \ndissolved if the wife so wishes \n  \nIf he has not had intercourse because the impediment preceded \nand followed the contract. If he has had intercourse, and then that \nimpediment occurs and he manages intercourse there is no \ndivorce. If he claims intercourse and she denies it, his statement is \ntaken when he swears to it. If he refuses, she swears and her word \nis taken. This is if she wishes a final divorce because every divorce \nmade by the qadi is final except in the case of someone who is \nunable to provide for his wife.  \n \n32.20 A missing husband  \n \n32.20a Period of Waiting  \n \nIf a man disappears his wife should wait four years from \nthe day she brings the matter to the notice of the \nappropriate authority \n  \nThis is when he is missing in the land of Islam, and has no known \nplace in a place of famine or wildness when he has a wife and she \nrefers her business to the ruler to investigate his news for him. If \nhe is free, then the period is four years. If he is a slave, it is two \nyears. The time begins from when the case is presented to the \nauthorities.  \n \n32.20b The ‘Idda after the waiting period  \n \nWhen this period of time has elapsed she should observe \nthe same ‘Idda period as a woman whose husband has died. \nThen she may remarry if she wishes to  \n \nAnd she must observe mourning according to the famous position. \nAfter that she can marry and does not require the permission of \nthe ruler to marry.  \n \n32.20c His inheritance  \n \nThe wealth of such a man is not distributed as inheritance \nuntil such a time has passed that he could no longer be \nreasonably supposed to be alive \n  \nGenerally this is the age of eighty. The author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) choose it. \nShaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) chose seventy.  \n \n32.21 During the ‘Idda period  \n \nA woman may not be asked for in marriage during her \n‘Idda period although there is no harm in an indirect \nsuggestion being made provided it is done in an acceptable \nway \n  \nNo matter the reason for the „Idda. This means it is haram. When \nshe is in „Idda not from divorce, it is not haram since it is not \nthree. It is also unlawful to promise marriage from one of two \nsides so that she is certain of it. It is permissible to allude it so \nthat an intention is known.  \n \n32.22 Newly-wed  \n \nA man who marries a virgin can spend seven consecutive \nnights with her, overriding the rights of any other wives \nfor that period. If the woman has previously been married \nthe period is three nights \n  \nYoung or old, Muslim, Kitabi or slave. After this period the \ndivision begins.  \n \n32.23 Forbidden degrees among slave girls  \n \nIf a man has two slave girls who are sisters he may not \nhave sexual intercourse with both of them. If, having had \nsexual intercourse with one of them, he desires to have \nsexual intercourse with the other, he must separate \nhimself from the first, making her haram for himself, by \neither selling her or making an arrangement with her to \nbuy her freedom [kitaba] or by setting her free or by any \nother means by which she would become haram for him \n  \nOr any other forms of sexual pleasure. If he owns both, he has \nintercourse with one but refrains from other. If he wants to have \nintercourse with the other, he must made the first unlawful for \nhimself, either after the istibra' by selling her. If the sale is not \nfinal, like the sell with an option, the first woman is not unlawful \nto him until the end of the days of the option. Other possibilities \nare kitaba.  \n \n32.23a Consequences of intercourse  \n \nIf a man has had sexual intercourse with one of his slave \ngirls, her mother and daughters become haram for him and \nshe also becomes haram for his father and sons as is the \ncase in marriage \n  \nThis is based on analogy.  \n \n32.24 Divorce by a slave, minor or wife  \n \nA \nslave \ncan \ndivorce \nwithout \ngetting \nhis \nmaster's \npermission. A child, however, cannot divorce \n  \n \n32.24a Divorce by a wife \n \nA woman whose husband has given her the authority to \ndivorce or the option to do so as long as the two are in the \nsame meeting \n  \nIn the meeting she must clearly state her choice. The woman with \nauthority may have authority for one or more divorce. \n  \n32.24b Sort of right of divorce  \n \nThe husband may deny the right of other than a single \ndivorce. If she has the option, it can only be a triple \ndivorce and he does not have the night to deny it \n  \nExcept for the option. This cannot be denied whether the marriage \nis consummated or not.  \n \n32.25 Ila': The Oath of Abstinence  \n \n32.25a Definition of the ila'  \n \nA man who swears not to have intercourse for more than \nfour months is considered to have pronounced an ila' \n  \nThis is whether the woman is Muslim, Kitabi or slave, intending \nharm by that. The period begins from the date of the oath, if it is \nexplicit, or from the day of stopping, and the judgment is that it is \nan oath which applies to less than the term, like the \"I will not \nhave intercourse with you until Zayd comes,\" and if it four months \nor less, it is not an ila'.  \n \n32.25b When the ila' becomes effective  \n \nThe divorce is only implemented after the end of the ila': \nwhich is four months if the man is free and two months if \nhe is a slave. Then the ruler gives him an ultimatum. If he \nresumes marital relations, then the ila' is canceled \n  \nThis is the famous position that there is no divorce until the end of \nthe term of ila'. It is the famous position that the ruler gives him \nan ultimatum to resume relations or divorce. If he resumes, then \nthe judgment of the 'ila' is removed by the words of the Almighty, \n\"If they resume Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Merciful,\" (Holy Qur‟an \n2:226) and resumption is achieved by the glans disappearing into \nthe vagina. If he does not resume, then the ruler commands him to \ndivorce. If he refuses, then the divorce is forced on him by the \nruler.  \n \n32.26 The Dhihar Divorce  \n \n32.26a Expiation of the Dhihar  \n \nIf someone pronounces a dhihar (a statement that sex with \nher is tantamount to incest) then he may not have \nintercourse with her until he expiates that by freeing a \nbelieving slave free of faults who is not partially owned by \nothers or in the process of obtaining freedom. If he cannot \ndo that, then he must fast two consecutive months. If he is \nunable to do that, he should feed sixty poor people two \nmudds each \n  \nFree or slave Muslim. He cannot have intercourse with her or kiss \nor touch her or look at her hair until he expiates for it. The \nmonths are lunar months which are counted by the moon. If he \nbreaks it, he starts anew because it must be continuous. If he \ncannot do that, then he feeds free Muslims. The slave is not fed for \nexpiation unless his master gives permission.  \n \n32.26b No intercourse until he done expiation  \n \nHe may not have intercourse with her night or day until \nthe end of the expiation. If does so, he must repent to Allah \nazza wa jall \n  \nHowever he does not have any other expiation. \n  \nIf he has intercourse after doing part of the expiation by \nfeeding or fasting, he starts it over again  \n \n32.26c Slaves freed in expiation  \n \nThere is no harm in freeing a one-eyed slave in the dhihar \nor a bastard. A child is sufficient, but we think it better to \nfree someone who fasts and prays \n  \nOr any other slave. The Malikis think it better, as opposed to a \nnursing child. He should support the freed child until he is able to \nearn.  \n \n32.27 The Li'an divorce  \n \n32.27a Definition of li'an  \n \nThe li'an divorce between a couple is when the man denies \npaternity provided that he claims that he has been apart \nfrom her since her last menstrual period or by actually \nwitnessing adultery, like a kohl stick in its case \n  \nThe li'an is an allowance made by the Book and Sunnah. There is \nno disagreement about it among the Imams. It takes place \nbetween a couple, even if their marriage is void, consummated or \nnot, or rather they are iniquitous as Shaikh ibn al-Mawwaz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) states. If someone marries a relative or his \nsister unknowingly and she becomes pregnant and he denies the \nchild, they curse each other because it appeared to be a marriage. \nIf she refuses, she receives the hadd. If he refuses, he receives the \nhadd for slander and the child is connected to him. It is a \nprecondition that the husband be a legally responsible Muslim \nwho can have intercourse. For the wife, there is a precondition \nthat she be one who can become pregnant. Neither Islam nor \nfreedom are preconditions. There can be a li'an from a Kitabi or \nslavegirl.  \n \nShe must have menstruated, even once. A similar case is when he \nclaims that he has not had intercourse with her after she had \ngiven birth previously this denied pregnancy. There must be a \nperiod between the two pregnancies which would make them \nseparate: that is six months or more. Or it is actually witnessing \nadultery. A precondition for the li'an in denying paternity is \nimmediacy. If he sees it and is silent and then takes a stand after \nthat, there is no li'an. A precondition for the li'an is actual and not \nhaving intercourse with her afterwards. If there is a delay there is \nno li'an for adultery.  \n \n32.27b Li'an in slander  \n \nThere is disagreement about whether li'an in the case of \nslander is allowed \n  \nWithout the claim of seeing intercourse or denying paternity in \ntwo famous positions, One is that he enacts the li'an and the other \nis that he receives the hadd and cannot enact the li'an.  \n \nFour rulings are connected to the li'an. He indicates one of them:  \n \n32.27c Li'an precludes pre-marriage  \n \nIf they divorce by li'an, they can never remarry \n  \nThe other three judgments is that there is no hadd punishment, \npaternity is denied and the marriage is ended. The separation \nbetween them occurs when the li'an is finished. It does not require \nthe judgment of a judge. It is abrogation, not divorce in the famous \nposition.  \n \n32.27d How the husband carries out the li'an  \n \nThe husband begins the li'an by testifying four times by \nAllah azza wa jall and then the fifth time he curses himself  \n \nIn the li'an. To deny paternity, he says, \"I testify by Allah that this \nchild is not mine\" four times. Shaikh al-Mawwaz (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that it is what is in the Mudawwana. It is the well-\nknown position that he says, \"I testify by Allah that she has \ncommitted adultery.\" If saw her, he says, \"I testify by Allah that I \nsaw her commit adultery.\" The fifth time he says that the curse of \nAllah is on him if he is one of the liars.  \n \n32.27e How the woman carries it out  \n \nThen she does the same four times, and the fifth invokes \nAllah's anger, as Allah azza wa jall has mentioned [in the \nHoly Qur'an 24:6-9] \n  \nShe denies the husband's oath, and when he states that he denies \npaternity and testifies by Allah azza wa jall that she committed \nadultery, she rejects that and says four times, \"I testify by Allah \nthat I have not committed fornication.\" When he says that he saw \nher and swears by Allah that he saw her fornicate, she refutes \nthat and say four times, \"He did not see me fornicate.\" The fifth \ntime she invokes the anger of Allah azza wa jall on her if he is \ntelling the truth.  \n \nThe li'an must take place in the presence of a group of people, with \na minimum of four and be in the highest place in the land. It only \ntakes place in the masjid. It is recommended that it be after the \n'Asr prayer and it is recommended to alarm them both, \nparticularly at the fifth oath and ]to tell them. \"This fifth oath will \noblige the punishment for you.\"  \n \n32.27f If the wife refuses to testify \n  \nIf the wife refuses to testify, she is stoned if she is free and \nmuhsana by intercourse with her husband or another \nhusband. Otherwise, she receives a hundred lashes \n  \nThis is after the husband's curse. There is half the punishment for \na Dhimmî.  \n \n32.27g If the husband refuses to testify  \n \nIf the husband refuses to testify, he is flogged eighty lashes \nfor slander and the child is considered to be his \n  \n \n32.28 Khul'  \n \nA woman may ransom herself from her husband by her \ndower or a sum more or less unless it is due to some injury \nto her. If there was an injury to her, she may reclaim what \nshe gave him and the khul' is still binding. The khul' is a \ndivorce which cannot be retracted except by a new \nmarriage contracted of her own accord \n  \nShe can do this if she is adult and sane and he is adult and sane. \nIf he is a child or mad, she cannot do that. If it is due to an injury, \nlike not paying maintenance nor making her do inappropriate \nwork and the harm is established by evidence, and the woman has \nalready obtained a khul' and then says it was only due to harm \nand presents the evidence for that, then the husband must return \nthe payment to her and the khul' is a final divorce. They cannot \nmarry again unless she has married again.  \n \n32.39 Divorce of Slaves  \n \nA woman freed from slavery who married to a slave can \nchoose between remaining married to him or separating \nfrom him. If someone buys his wife, then his marriage is \nvoid \n  \nA slave is allowed only two divorces and the ‘Idda of a \nslavegirl consists of two menstrual periods. The expiation’s \nof the slave are the same as the free man except for the \ndifferences in the hudud punishments and divorce \n  \n32.30 Kinship established by wet-nursing  \n \n32.30a This applies up to the age of two  \n \nAny milk which reaches the stomach of a nursing child in \nthe first two years, even one suck, makes marriage \nunlawful \n  \nThis is in accordance with the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"and \nyour mothers who nursed you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:23) It is applies, \neven if only on one occasion.\"  \n \nThere are certain preconditions necessary to cause the legal \nconsequences of suckling.  \n \n32.30b After the age of two  \n \nNursing after the age of two years does not cause these \nprohibitions, unless it is close to it, like a month or so, or \nsome say two months \n  \nAfter the age of two years, even if a lot of milk reaches his \nstomach, it does not create marriage barriers. This is based on the \nwords of Allah azza wa jall, \"Mothers shall suckle their children \nfor two full years,\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:233) and His words, \"his \ncarrying and weaning is 30 months.\" (Holy Qur‟an 46:15) So He \ninforms us about the minimum period of pregnancy and full period \nof nursing. A little over two years does not matter. Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi alaihi) says a month and Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) two months.  \n \n32.30c When the child is weaned before the age of two  \n \nIf the child is weaned before the age of two so that it eats \nfood without milk, any nursing which happens after that \ndoes not create these prohibitions \n  \nThis is according to what is in Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh an-Nasa'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) report that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Nursing does not \ncreate prohibitions except what splits the intestines,\" and that is \nbefore weaning. If a child eats food rather than milk, his \nintestines are opened.  \n \n32.30d Milk being poured into the mouth or nose  \n \nNursing by pouring milk into the mouth or nose creates \nthe same prohibitions \n  \nEven if it is not definite that it reached the stomach. That is what \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) reports from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays that if it reaches the stomach, it creates prohibition but \notherwise not.  \n \n32.30e Milk sisters  \n \nIf a woman nurses a boy, her daughters and her husband's \ndaughters, whether born before or after the boy, are his \nsisters. However the boy's brother may marry them.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 33: ‘Idda, Istibra' and Maintenance \n \n \n„Idda designates a woman waiting for a specific time determined \nby the Shari‟ah to see if she is pregnant. It is also a form of \nworship in itself. It is obligatory by the words of the Almighty, \n\"until the book reaches its term\" and because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said to Shaikh al-Furay'a (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \"Wait in your house until the book reaches its term.\" There \nare three types: menstrual periods, lunar months and pregnancy. \nPeriods apply to the divorced woman who menstruates, free or \nslave.  \n \n33.1 ‘Idda for divorced women  \n \n33.1a Its length  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a free woman is three periods, whether she is \nMuslim or kitabi. For a slave or partial slave, it is two \nperiods. It does not matter whether the husband is free or \na slave. A 'period' means the periods of purity between two \nmenstruation’s \n  \nThe ayat is general and this is not disputed. „Idda has to do with \nthe woman, not the husband. Divorce has to do with the men. A \nperiod is the period of purity. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says it is menstrual periods.  \n \n33.1b If the woman is not menstruating  \n \nIf the woman is not menstruating or has ceased \nmenstruation, then it is three months for a free woman, \nfree or slave \n  \nSo she cannot be pregnant. It is three months. This is agreed. It is \nthe same for the slavegirl in the famous position. This is \ncalculated by the moon. When she is divorced during the month, \nthe month in which is which is divorced is completed from the \nfourth month. The day of divorce is not counted.  \n \n33.1c A woman with constant bleeding  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a divorced woman with constant bleeding is \none year, slave or free  \n \nThat is nine months and third months.  \n \n33.1d ‘Idda for pregnant women  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a pregnant woman who is widowed or \ndivorced is when she gives birth, whether free or slave or \nkitabi \n  \nThis is in the famous position in divorce and is agreed, even if it is \na minute after the divorce or death. This applies to all by the \nwords of the Almighty, \"The term of those who are pregnant is \nwhen they lay down their burdens.\" (Holy Qur‟an 65:5) It is makes \nthe general particular in \"those of you who die and leave wives, \nthey should wait by themselves for fourth months and ten days.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 2:234) The limitation of it is clarification. If she gives \nbirth to twins, she is not lawful until she gives birth to the second.  \n \n33.1e No ‘Idda if the marriage has not been consummated \n  \nA \ndivorced \nwoman \nwhose \nmarriage \nhas \nnot \nbeen \nconsummated has no ‘Idda  \n \n33.2 ‘Idda for widows  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a free woman who is widowed is four months \nand ten nights, whether a child or adult, consummated or \nnot, Muslim or kitabi. For a slave girl who is partially free \nit is two months and five days, except in the case of an \nolder woman whose period is delayed. Then she waits until \nthe doubt is removed. As for the one who does not \nmenstruate because of youth or old age and her marriage \nwas consummated, she cannot marry until three months \nafter the death of the husband \n  \nThis is a woman who is not pregnant, whether with false \nmenstruation or not. It is the same whatever the age of the \nhusband. Removal of doubt is by menstruation or the completion \nof nine months.  \n \n33.3 Mourning  \n \nMourning for the woman in ‘Idda because of being \nwidowed is that she not use any adornment in the form of \njewelry, kohl or other things, and she avoids all dyed \ncolors except black. She avoids all perfume. She does not \nuse henna or perfumed oil nor comb perfumed substances \ninto her hair. Mourning should be observed by the slave \nand free woman, child and adult. There is disagreement \nabout a Kitabi. A divorced woman does not have to observe \nmourning  \n \nIhdad is mourning. She avoids bracelets and similar things, and \nkohl, which would appear to be even if it was out of necessity, \nwhich it the position of Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). In the Mudawwana, \"She does not use kohl except for \nnecessity.\" She removes dishevelment from her self. She does not \nenter the bath-house except by necessity and does not rub her \nbody with depilatories. Black can be worn as the garment of \nsorrow. If it is an adornment among some people, she should avoid \nit. She avoids perfume and adornment because that invites \nmarriage. Henna is adornment. Mourning is observed by all ages \nbecause in Abu Dawud the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"The woman whose husband dies does not wear saffron or \nred garments, or jewelry or use henna.\" There is disagreement \nabout a Kitabi with two famous positions about whether it is \nobligatory.  \n \n33.4 The ‘Idda for a Jewish or Christian woman and umm \nWalad  \n \nA free Kitabi woman should be compelled to observe the \n‘Idda for a Muslim husband who has died or divorced her. \nThe ‘Idda of a umm Walad after the death of her master is \none menstrual period. It is the same when he frees her. If \nshe does not menstruate, it is three months  \n \nWhether it is a single or final divorce because mourning is \nprescribed to protect lineage. The man has died and has no one to \nprotect his lineage and so mourning becomes a barrier to defend \nthe dead. The Kitabi is compelled whether the marriage has been \nconsummated or not, even if she is a child or he is one.  \n \n33.5 Istibra'  \n \nIstibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes \nownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by \nselling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the \nwoman menstruates after being in the possession of the \nnew master before he has bought her, then she does not \nhave to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out. The \nistibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is \nfor a woman who no longer menstruates. There is no \nistibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse \n  \nIf someone buys a pregnant woman from another person or \ngains possession of her without a sale, should not go near \nher or enjoy her in any manner until she gives birth \n  \nOmitted explanation!  \n \n33.7 Lodging and maintenance of divorced wives  \n \n33.7a Right to lodging and maintenance  \n \nA divorced woman whose marriage has been consummated \nhas the right to lodging, but not maintenance unless she \nwas divorced by less than three divorces or is pregnant. If \npregnant, she has a right to maintenance whether it is one \nor three divorces \n  \nThis is distinct from khul'. Any woman whose marriage has been \nconsummated has the right to maintenance.  \n \n33.7b The position of a woman separated by a khul'  \n \nA woman with a khul' divorce has not right to maintenance \nunless she is pregnant \n  \nAny woman divorced by a final divorce is not entitled to \nmaintenance unless she is pregnant.  \n \n33.7c A woman divorced by li'an  \n \nThe woman divorce by a li'an has no maintenance, even if \nshe is pregnant \n  \nBecause the husband has denied paternity.  \n \n33.7d Widows  \n \nIn the ‘Idda period on account of being widowed, she has \nno right to maintenance but to lodging if the house \nbelonged to the decreased or he rented it \n  \nIf the marriage was consummated.  \n \n33.8 Confinement in ‘Idda  \n \nWhen she is divorced or widowed, she should not leave her \nhouse until her ‘Idda is over unless the owner of the house \nevicts her and will not accept a normal rent. Then she \nleaves and stays in the place to which she moves until the \nend of the ‘Idda \n  \nShe is not moved from her house unless it is a case of necessity. \nShe is permitted to go out to see to her needs: what this refers to \nis moving house. She must spend the night in her house. She does \nnot leave for hajj during this time.  \n \n33.9 Nursing and custody of children  \n \n33.9a Nursing the child  \n \nThe woman should nurse her child in the marriage unless \nsomeone of her status should not do so. A divorced woman \ncan nurse the child for the father and she can take a fee for \nnursing if she wishes \n  \nIf she is married or has been divorced by a revocable divorce. In \nsuch a case she receives no fee. \"A divorced woman\" refers to a \nwoman who is finally divorced or who has finished her „Idda. The \nright of nursing is a right in her favor, not one against her based \non what is reported by Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said to a woman whose \nhusband had divorced her and wanted to take her child from her, \n\"You are more entitled to the child than he is as long as you do not \nre-marry.\"  \n \n33.9b Custody  \n \nAfter a divorce, the woman has custody of a boy until he \nreaches puberty and a girl until she marries and the \nmarriage consummated \n  \nThis is the right of the mother, be she free or slave, Muslim, or \nKitabi, sensible or foolish according to Shaikh ibn 'Arafa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). This right also pertains if she is widowed. \nThe girl's maintenance is owed by the father until her marriage is \nconsummated.  \n \n33.9c Order of custody  \n \nAfter that if the mother dies or remarries, custody goes to \nthe grandmother and then the maternal aunt. If there are \nno female relatives of the mother, then it goes to one of the \nsisters and paternal uncles. If there are none, then the \nagnate relatives \n  \nCustody goes first to the mother's mother and then the father's \nmother.  \n \n33.10 Recipients of Maintenance  \n \n33.10a The wife  \n \nA man is only responsible for the maintenance of his wife, \nwhether she is rich or poor \n  \nA wealthy man is obliged to provide food, condiments, clothes and \na dwelling once he has consummated the marriage or has been \ninvited to do so while the woman is capable of intercourse. It does \nnot matter whether she is wealthy or poor, Muslim or Kitabi, free \nor slave. A divorce can be imposed on him if he is unable to \nprovide for him unless she knew of his inability in advance.  \n \n33.10b His poor parents  \n \nand his poor parents  \n \nWho are free, whether they are Muslims or unbelievers and he \nacknowledges their poverty. If he denies that they are poor, they \nmust prove but are not required to make an oath. Making them \ntake an oath would involve disrespect.  \n \n33.10c His children: sons  \n \nand to his young children who have no wealth. He is \nresponsible for sons until they reach puberty if they have \nno crippling disability \n  \nThis is free children, even if they are unbelievers. This means a \ndisability which would prevent them from earning, as when they \nare insane or blind. Then the father is required to continue to \nsupport them.  \n \n33.10d His daughters  \n \nand for girls until they marry and their marriages are \nconsummated \n  \nOr the husband, who is adult, has been invited to consummate the \nmarriage. When her husband divorces her or dies, her father is \nnot responsible for her maintenance if she is adult. If she is not \nadult, it reverts to him.  \n \n33.10e He is not responsible for other relatives  \n \nThese are the only relatives whose maintenance he is \nresponsible for \n  \nHe is not responsible for grandparents or grandchildren.  \n \n33.10f Providing the wife with servants  \n \nIf he is wealthy enough, he should provide his wife with \nservants \n  \nThis is an obligation when his wife is not someone who usually \nserves herself.  \n \n33.11 Burial  \n \n33.11a Burying slaves  \n \nHe must also maintain his slaves and shroud them if they \ndie \n  \nThe obligation is from the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) in the Sahih, \"The best sadaqa is that given by the \nwealthy. The upper hand is better than the lower hand. Begin \nwith your immediate dependents. The woman says, 'Either you \nfeed me or release me, the slave says, 'Feed me and use me,' and \nthe child says, 'Feed me until you let me go.'\"  \n \n33.11b Shrouding the wife  \n \nHere is disagreement about shrouding the wife, Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is done using \nher own money, and Shaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that it comes from the husband's money. \nShaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if she is \nwealthy her money is used, and if she is poor, it is done \nfrom her husband's money \n  \nIf she is wealthy her money is used and the husband is not obliged \nto pay it because shrouding is part of maintenance which ends \nwith death. Otherwise the tie of marriage obliges that he do it \nsince he can wash her and she her private parts and they inherit \nfrom one another.  \n \n \n \nChapter 34: Sales \n \n \nThis includes hire, partnership and all sale transactions, like cash \nsales and selling a debt, sound and invalid sales, the definition of \nthe sale and transfer of goods.  \n \nThere are three essential elements of the sale:  \n \n1.  The seller and the buyer, both of whom must possess \ndiscrimination and so a sale of a child or mad person is not \nvalid, \nand \npossess \nlegal \nresponsibility, \nwhich \nis \na \nprecondition for the sale being binding. Islam is a \nprecondition for buying a Holy Qur'an or a Muslim slave.  \n \n2.  The second is the price, which must be pure, consist of \nsomething which has a use, be something which can be \nhanded over, known by both parties and something whose \nsale is not forbidden.  \n \n3.  The third element is the form of the transaction which is the \noffer and acceptance, or that which indicates acceptance like \ncustomary behavior in such matters.  \n \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) begins the chapter with the \nwords of Allah azza wa jall:  \n \n34.1 Exchange of money  \n \n\"Allah has allowed trade and made usury unlawful.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 2:274)  \n \n34.1a. Legal status of usury  \n \nThe Sunnah and consensus make it unlawful. If someone states \nthat usury is lawful, there is no disagreement that he is an \nunbeliever.  \n \n34.1b. Usury in extending the terms of a debt  \n \nThe usury practiced in the Jahiliyya in debts was that \nwhen they were due, they were either paid or delayed in \nexchange for a payment of usury.  \n \nIn exchange for a delay, an increase was paid.  \n \n34.1c. Usury in exchange  \n \nBesides usury in exchange for delay, usury also consists of \nselling silver for silver, hand to hand, in unequal amounts. \nThe same applies in the case of gold for gold. Silver for \nsilver and gold for gold are not permitted except like for \nlike, hand to hand. Gold for silver is usury except hand to \nhand.  \n \nThe basis for the prohibition is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Do not sell gold for gold, except like for like.\" The \nsame applies to silver. \"Hand to hand\" means that the transaction \nis immediate.  \n \n34.2 Exchanges involving foodstuffs  \n \n34.2a. Immediacy in the exchange of stored foodstuffs  \n \nThe same applies to food grains, beans and similar foods or \ncondiments which can be stored. It is not permitted to \nexchange one category of them for the same category \nexcept hand to hand like for like. It is not permitted for \nthere to be a delay in this.  \n \nThis includes barley, millet, rice and all such grains. This would \nalso apply to such condiments as vinegar and honey. The fact that \na delay is not permissible is stressed when he says, \"hand to hand\" \nwhich means it must be immediate and direct. One considers \nlikeness in terms of legal weighing or measurement. If no criterion \nhas been transmitted from the Lawgiver about something, then \none uses whatever the customary criterion is.  \n \n34.2b. Delay not allowed in foodstuffs  \n \nIt is not permitted to exchange food for food with a delay, \nwhether in the same category or different categories, and \nwhether that can be stored or not.  \n \nThis includes fruits like pomegranates and melons because a \ndelay would entail usury.  \n \n34.2c. Exchange of perishables  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with exchanging fruits and \nvegetables which cannot stored in unequal amounts, even \nif they are of the same kind, provided it is hand to hand.  \n \nFruits which cannot be stored are like apricots and apples. \nDisparity is permitted in them, even if they are stored in rare \ncases in certain climates. This is like the case with pears, in which \nthere can be disparity in the well-known position.  \n \nIt is not permitted to have a disparity in the same category \nof dried fruits and other condiments, food and drink which \ncan be stored, except for water. There is nothing strong in \nexchanging different categories of other grains and fruit \nand foods in equal amounts from hand to hand. It is not \npermitted to have a disparity in the same category except \nin the case of fresh fruits and vegetables.  \n \nIf the items are usually storable, like walnuts and almonds, then \ndisparity is not permitted. This is a weak position in the School. \nThe well-known position is that disparity is permitted in them. \n \nDisparity is forbidden in food drink and condiments, food like \nhoney and vinegar. Disparity is permitted in water, but it is not \npermitted to sell it for food on credit according to the well-known \nposition.  \n \nThe allowance for disparity in fruit and vegetables is based on the \nsound hadith in which the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid \"When the categories are different, then sell however you \nwish.\"  \n \nHis final statement includes storable and unstorable, and this \ncontradicts what he said before about storable fruits, but we \nalready stated that the well-known position is that disparity is \nallowed in them. The difference between the permission for fresh \nfruit and vegetables and its prohibition in the case of foodstuffs is \nthat foodstuffs include that which can be stored and which is a \nmajor source of nourishment. Even if fruits and vegetables are \nstored at times, they are not a major food source.  \n \nThen he goes on to discuss those categories in which major \ndisparity is not permitted.  \n \n34.2d. Categories of foods in which there can be no \ndisparity  \n \nWheat, barley and sult-barley comprise one category in \nrespect of lawfulness and or unlawfulness. All sorts of \nraisins comprise one category. All sorts of dates comprise \none category. Beans have different categories in regard to \nsales. The position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nvaries regarding this, but his position about them being \none category for zakat purposes does not vary.  \n \nSult is huskless barley. There can be no disparity in the exchange \nof raisins or dates although they have different varieties. Shaikh \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that they have different \ncategories while Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) states \nthat they are the same category. For zakat purposes, the \nMudawwana states that they are a single category.  \n \n34.2e. Meat  \n \nThe meat of the quadrupeds and wild animals is \nconsidered to one category, the meat of all types of fowl is \none category, and the flesh of all water creatures is one \ncategory. Fat falls into the category of the flesh from which \nit is extracted.  \n \nQuadrupeds are: camels, cattle, sheep and goats. Wild animals \ninclude gazelles and wildebeests. The category of fowls includes \nboth wild birds and domestic ones. The flesh of an animal cannot \nbe sold for its fat except like for like, hand to hand. The same \napplies to fish oil for fish: it can only be like for like, hand to hand.  \n \n34.2f. Animal products  \n \nYogurt, cheese and butter are classified according to the \ncategory of the animals from which they are taken.  \n \nThis is one of the unclear areas of the Risala as to whether they \ncan be sold one for the other. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand his people do not permit that. Shaikh al-Jazuli (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that what is meant is that the types of milk are one \ncategory, cheese is one category and butter is one category, and \nthey are to sold like for like without disparity.  \n \n34.3 Selling goods not yet in one's possession  \n \n34.3a. Foods which cannot be sold before possession  \n \nSomeone who buys food is not permitted to sell it before he \ntakes possession of it, provided that the purchase was by \nweight, volume or number rather than unmeasured. That \nis the case for every food, condiment or drink except \nwater.  \n \nIt is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade that. This general prohibition is then restricted to the \ncategories mentioned. \"Unmeasured\" [juzaf] refers a sale without \nmeasure, weight or number. In such an (unmeasured) sale it is \npermitted to re-sell the goods before taking possession of them \naccording to the well-known position because ownership is \nachieved by the contract. Therefore if it is destroyed before he \ntakes possession of it, it is the buyer's liability. Water is excepted \nbecause it is not a food.  \n \n34.3b. Medicines and non-oil crops  \n \nMedicines and crops which are not pressed for oil are not \namong the foods which it is forbidden to sell before taking \npossession of them or which cannot be exchanged for \nunequal amounts of the same category.  \n \nLike honey which is compounded with other drugs and made into \na medicine. Crops which are not pressed normally are like onion \nseeds, chard and white radish seeds, but not seeds like sesame \nand olives which are pressed for oil. It also includes things like \nonions, garlic, coriander, cumin, fennel and pepper. It is permitted \nto sell them before receiving them and disparity in amounts is also \npermitted.  \n \n34.3c. Selling borrowed food before taking possession of it „ \n \nThere is nothing wrong with selling borrowed food before \ntaking possession of it.  \n \nIt is permitted for the one who borrows to sell it before he has full \npossession of the loan, provided it is a cash sale. That is not \npermitted in a credit sale because if the borrower were to sell it on \ncredit, that would invalid since it would be selling a debt for a \ndebt.  \n \n34.3d. Partnership, cost resale and revocation of sales are \npermitted  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with partnership in buying, in cost \nresale, or in revocation of a sale before taking possession, \nin the case of food which is measured.  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with partnership in measured food stuffs \nbefore taking possession. That is when someone has a partner in \nsome of it. There is nothing wrong in cost resale [tawliya], which \nis when he sells the commodity to someone for the same price he \npaid for it. There is nothing wrong in revocation, which is when \nthe buyer withdraws from the seller or vice versa.  \n \n34.4 Transactions which entail risk  \n \n34.4a. Contracts which entail risk are not permitted  \n \nEvery sales contract, hire or lease which contains danger \nor risk in respect of the price, the item purchased or the \nterm at which payment is due is not permitted. It is not \npermitted to sell something uncertain or to sell something \nunknown or to sell to an unknown term.  \n \n \nDanger is when it is not certain that the commodity exists, as \nwhen someone says, \"Sell me your horse in exchange for my \nprofits tomorrow.\" Risk is when one is certain something exists \nbut there are doubts about its soundness, as in selling fruits \nbefore they are ripe.  \n \nAn example of what is forbidden when there is risk in the price is \nwhen someone buys goods in exchange for his stray camel. In \nregard to the purchased item it is like when someone buys a \nrunaway slave. Risk in the term is when someone buys goods \nagainst the arrival of Zayd when he does not know when he will \nactually come.  \n \n34.5 Selling goods with hidden defects  \n \n34.5a. Deceit is not permitted  \n \nIn selling, it is not permitted to conceal faults or to \nadulterate things, nor to overrate or mislead, nor to \nconceal defects. It is not permitted to mix the bad with the \ngood, nor to conceal something about the goods which, if \nknown, would make the buyer dislike it or which would \nreduce the price if were known.  \n \nConcealment [tadlis] is to know that there is a fault in the goods, \nbut to conceal that from the buyer. Adulteration is to add \nsomething which is not part of the thing, like adding water to \nhoney. Overrating is deceit by lying about the price as when \nsomeone says, \"I bought it for twenty dinars and I will give you it \nto you for less!\" Misleading is to gull with words as when the seller \ntells him, \"Buy it from me and I will give you a reduction! “Nor is \nit permitted to mix poor wheat with good wheat.  \n \nIt is not permitted to conceal defects which would put off the \nbuyer, such as selling cloth which has been previously used as a \nshroud or by a leper. Something which would reduce the price is, \nfor instance, if a new garment is impure or has been washed.  \n \n34.5b. Defects in slaves  \n \nIf someone buys a slave and finds a defect in him, he can \nkeep him without any compensation, or return him and get \nhis money back, unless the slave has acquired a new \ncorrupting defect while in his possession. If this is the \ncase, the new owner may claim back the amount of the \noriginal defect from the price he paid, or he can return the \nslave and pay the depreciation caused by the new defect.  \n \nIf he returns a slave because of a defect and has put him to \nwork to earn revenue while he was with him, he keeps the \nrevenue.  \n \nThe same principle applies to buying slaves. The buyer has a \nchoice between keeping the slave and returning him. If he keeps \nthe slave, he receives nothing for the fault. He is allowed to return \nthe slave because there might have been concealment [tadlis] in \nthe sale. This principle applies to faults which can be concealed, \nnot a fault it is impossible to conceal since it is evident, like \nblindness, or something which is necessarily hidden, like a nut \nwhich is found to be empty when opened. In such a case, there is \nnothing the buyer can say.  \n \nIf the slave has acquired a new defect while in the possession of \nthe buyer, it must be one which would seriously decrease his \nvalue.  \n \nIf the buyer had the slave to work for him, he keeps the revenue \nfrom that work up until the time the deal is nullified, and he is not \nobliged to hand over any of that, since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Income is with responsibility.\" One of them \nsaid that the meaning of that is the as long as the goods are the \nresponsibility of the buyer, he is entitled to the revenue. When the \nsale is nullified, then the seller is entitled to the revenue.  \n \n34.6 Selling merchandise on trial, a slave with a guarantee \nor a slave girl in seclusion  \n \n34.6a. Selling on trial [khiyar]  \n \nA sale with an option to cancel is permitted when the two \nparties stipulate a short period in which the buyer can test \nthe goods or in which to seek advice. Immediate payment \nis not permitted in such a sale.  \n \nOne or both parties can make this stipulation. It is permitted \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The buyer \nand seller have the option to withdraw as long as they have not \nparted.\" Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted that in the \nMuwatta' and stated that it was permitted. They can stipulate a \nshort period which ends when the goods have been tested or until \nadvice sought has been sought. The advice can be about the \ncheapness or dearness of the price, or about undertaking the \npurchase or sale. Testing can be about ascertaining the condition \nof the goods. That varies according to different goods. The option \nin the case of a riding animal is about three days, For slaves, it is \nabout five days or a week in which to test his condition and work. \nThere is about a month for a house.  \n \n34.6c. Slave with indemnification ('uhda)  \n \nNor is immediate payment permitted in the case of a slave \nwith a three day guarantee. [Holy Qur’an 34:14]  \n \nThis is selling a slave provided that the seller has responsibility \nfor any faults that come to light in the course of three days after \nthe contract.  \n \n34.6d. A slavegirl in seclusion [muwada'a]  \n \nNor is there immediate payment in the case of a slavegirl \nplaced in seclusion to ascertain whether she is pregnant. \nThe responsibility and maintenance in that period are that \nof the seller.  \n \nPayment is also not made immediately when a slavegirl in \nseclusion is sold. It is when a valuable slavegirl or one with whom \nthe seller has had intercourse is put in the keeping of a \ntrustworthy man or woman until it is clear whether or not she is \npregnant.  \n \nPayment in these three cases is suspended when cash is \nstipulated because sometimes it will become a sale and sometimes \nit is a loan, and so it is unclear whether the payment is an \nadvance or a price.  \n \nThe seller is responsible for the goods in these cases, and for \nmaintenance of the slavegirl, as long as it is not evident that the \nbuyer is lying. In such a case, he must take an oath, even he is not \nsuspected.  \n \n34.6e. When slavegirls are secluded  \n \nA slave girl is usually only secluded to see whether she is \npregnant is when she is purchased to take to bed or when \nthe seller states that he has had intercourse with her, even \nif she is ugly. The buyer cannot absolve the seller from the \nresponsibility for the pregnancy unless it is clear and \nobvious. Absolving the seller of responsibility in things \nabout the slave about which the seller has no knowledge is \nallowed.  \n \nThis seclusion is an obligation for two types of slavegirl to \nascertain if the woman is pregnant. One is when the buyer wants \nher to sleep with, even if the seller does not admit to intercourse \nwith her since the most likely case is that intercourse might have \noccurred, and so the most likely is given the standing of the \ndefinite out of caution in sexual matters. The second case is a \nslavegirl with whom he had has intercourse in case she might be \npregnant.  \n \nIf the slavegirl is valuable and the buyer has not had intercourse \nwith her, and he says that he is not responsible for any pregnancy, \nthe sale is invalid. If she is clearly pregnant, then he may \nstipulate that he is not responsible for her pregnancy. He limits it \nto \"valuable\" rather than ugly. It is absolutely permitted to \nstipulate that he is not responsible for the pregnancy of an ugly \nslavegirl, whether that is clear or not.  \n \nOne may absolve himself in the case of slaves, but not other \nthings. That is the well-known position. The permissibility of that \nis limited to two things. One is that the seller does not know about \nit. If he knows that there is a fault and disclaims responsibility for \nit, that does not help him. The second is that he has remained a \nlong time with it. If, for instance, he buys a slave and then sells \nhim soon afterwards, stipulating his lack of liability, that is of no \nuse.  \n \n34.6f. A mother may not be separated from her child  \n \nA mother and her child are not separated in a sale until the \nchild has grown his second set of teeth.  \n \nIt is not permitted to separate them. This applies to children by \nlineage and applies whether they, the mother and child, are \nMuslims or unbelievers, or one is Muslim and the other an \nunbeliever since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) made a \ngeneral statement about that: \"If someone separates a mother \nfrom her child, Allah azza wa jall will separate him from those he \nloves on the Day of Rising.\" [Shaikh at-Tirmidhi, hasan]. It is \nlimited to the mother by lineage, not the mother by suckling. It is \npermitted to separate them if the relationship is only one of \nsuckling. It does not include other relatives besides the mother, \nlike the father. It is permitted to sell them separately.  \n \nThe prohibition against separation has a point at which it ends. \nThe second teeth refers to when the milk teeth fall out. Then it is \npermitted to sell them separately because the child is independent \nfrom his mother in eating, drinking, and sleeping.  \n \n34.7 Responsibility in an invalid sale  \n \n34.7a. Basic rule of responsibility for the goods  \n \nIn an invalid sale, the seller remains responsible for the \ngoods. But if the buyer has taken possession of them, he is \nresponsible for them from the time he has them in his \npossession.  \n \nAn invalid sale would be like one conducted during the adhan for \nJumu'a. The seller remains responsible because it is still his \nproperty and ownership has not been transferred to the buyer. If \nthe buyer has taken possession of them, he is responsible because \nhe has not taken them as a trust, but as a sort of quasi-ownership. \nThat is the reason given by Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated there is \nsome confusion in his reasoning, since it is obvious, as stated \nbefore, that there is no transfer in an invalid sale while there \nmust be a transfer according to his argument. It is possible that \nhe means that his taking possession is quasi-ownership is based \non his claim. When he takes possession, thinking that he is taking \nownership and then causes damage, he is responsible, even if \nownership has not been transferred to him in reality. That is why \nhe is liable. That applies from the moment he takes possession of \nthe goods, not from the moment he makes the contract. If the \ncontract had been sound, he would have been responsible from the \nmoment the contract was concluded.  \n \n34.7b. Consequences of buyer responsibility  \n \nSo if the market price changes or the commodity is altered, \nthen the buyer must pay its price on the day he bought it \nand does not return it. If, however, it is something sold by \nmeasure or weight, he must return its equivalent. Real \nestate is unaffected by market changes.  \n \nThe market price can rise or fall. If the commodity is altered and \nit is possible to assess its value, the buyer must pay that amount, \nwhatever it is, even it is more than the original price, not the price \non day of the judgment, and then he does not have to return the \ngoods if they still exist. If it is something replaceable, which can \nbe weighed, measured or counted, then he returns the equivalent. \nIf it is impossible to return the like, then he must pay the price. \nAn example of this is fresh dates when their time has passed. \nThen the price is assessed on the day he is unable to pay.  \n \nReal estate is not affected because usually land is bought for \nprivate use, and so a change in the price is not investigated, which \nis not the case with other things.  \n \n34.8 Free loans [salaf] \n \ni.e. not a loan meant as an investment  \n \n34.8a Illegal transactions in loans  \n \nIt is not permitted to make a loan in exchange for some \nbenefit [for the lender]. It is not permitted to combine a \nsale and a loan in a single transaction. The same applies if \nthe loan is combined with hire or rental.  \n \nThat is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nthat. That is like when someone has some poor quality wheat and \nlends it to someone who takes it from him in exchange for \nrepaying it with good wheat.  \n \nAn example of the form of combining a sale and a loan is when two \ngoods are sold for two dinars with a month's credit and then one of \nthem is bought for a dinar in cash. So it is as if the seller has \ntaken one item and a dinar in cash and at the end of the term, he \ntakes two dinars: one in exchange for the goods, which is a sale, \nand the second in exchange for the dinar in cash, which is a loan.  \n \nNor is permitted to couple a loan with hire or rent as a \nprecondition for making the loan, because hire or rent are a form \nof sale and not a special quality in themselves. It is not permitted \nto make a loan a precondition of marriage, partnership, the qirad \nloan, musaqa or money changing.  \n \nTo sum up, no contract entailing compensation can be combined \nwith a loan.  \n \n34.8b. What can be lent  \n \nA loan is permitted in everything except slave girls or \nsilver ore.  \n \nA loan [salaf] means giving something with the intention of \npleasing Allah azza wa jall so that the borrower can use it and \nthen return its equivalent. It is permitted, i.e. recommended, in \nitems which will be useful for the borrower and relieve his \ndifficulties. It can also become obligatory or forbidden in certain \ncases. It is allowed in everything which it is lawful to own, even if \nit is not valid to sell it, and thus includes the tanned skin of \ncarrion and the meat of sacrifices.  \n \nSlavegirls are an exception to this because that would lead to \nlending sexual favors, although a loan of a slavegirl can be made \nto a woman or to a child who is of an age where he cannot have \nintercourse. That is permitted as stated by Shaikh al-Lakhmi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others.  \n \n34.9 Surrendering borrowed or sold property  \n \n34.9a. No reductions or increases allowed for a change in \nthe collection date  \n \nA reduction in the debt is not permitted in order to hasten \nits collection nor can it be delayed in exchange for an \nincrease in the amount due.  \n \nThis is according to the well-known position. The fuqaha' call this \ncase \"putting down and expediting\". Its form is that one man owes \na debt to another which is due at a certain time, like a hundred \ndirhams with a month's credit. The one owed the debt tells him, \n\"Give me the fifty now and I will reduce it by fifty for you.\" This is \nforbidden because whoever moves up a thing before it is obliged \nbecomes a borrower. So it is as if the payer is lending the one owed \nthe money fifty dirhams in exchange for his responsibility when \nthe 100 are due. So it is a loan in exchange for an increase. If that \noccurs, what he took from him is returned to him. When the term \ncomes, the lender takes all that he was first due, which is 100.  \n \nThe same applies to delaying the debt in exchange for an increase, \nas happened in the Jahiliyya because that is borrowing for an \nincrease. When the time for repayment comes, the person who \nowes the debt says, \"Give me a delay and I will give you more than \nyou are owed.\"  \n \n34.9b. Not granting an increase in return for earlier \npossession  \n \nGoods are not collected sooner in exchange for increase in \nthem when there is a sale involved.  \n \nThat is part of getting rid of responsibility for the goods. An \nexample of a case in which you are given an increase is when you \nbuying a hundred garments of known description from a man and \nhe tells you, \"Take your garments,\" and you reply, \"I will leave \nthem with you. I have no need of them now.\" He says, \"Take them \naway and I will give you five more.\" That five is in return for \ncanceling his responsibility for them.  \n \n34.9c. Returning borrowed goods before they are due  \n \nThere is no harm in returning a loan early with an \nincrease which is only in the quality.  \n \nThere are two preconditions here. One is that the goods are part of \na loan and the second is that the increase is only in the quality. \nFor instance, if the borrowed garment is one of poor quality, he \nsays, \"I will give you better than it if I return it early.  \n \n34.9d. Returning a loan with an increase  \n \nThere is disagreement about when someone repays a trade \nloan [qard] with an additional amount at the time of \nrepayment when there was no stipulation, promise or \ncustom to do so. Ashhab allowed that, but Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked it and did not allow it.  \n \n\"At the time of repayment due (lit. meeting of settlement)\" is the \nmoment in which it is paid, whether that is before or after the \nagreed term. A stipulation about this would be, for example, when \nthe lender says, \"I will not lend to you unless you give me more \nthan I lent you.\" A custom refers to the borrower who normally \ngives more when he repays. The reason for allowing it is that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The best of people is \nthe one who is the best in payment, and the best of you is the one \nwho is the best repayment,\" as Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) said. The literal words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwould mean that Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) allowed it \nabsolutely, whether a little or a lot of increase. What Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) actually allowed is a small increase \nlike a dinar in a hundred and one ardib in a hundred. It is possible \nthat Shaikh Ashhab's (rahmatullahi alaihi) position applies both \nto a little and a lot. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ndisliked doing that with a prohibitive dislike in the well-known \nposition.  \n \n34.9e. Payment before the loan is due  \n \nIf someone owes dinars or dirhams as the result of a sale or \na loan which has a set term, he can pay them before they \nare due. He can also hand over goods or food from a loan \nearly, but not when it is because of a sale.  \n \nThat is because the term is his right. If he forgoes his right, then \nthe lender must accept it and is compelled to do so. This is the \nsame for a loan or a debt. He cannot be compelled to accept it in \nthe case of in a sale or an advance because they both have a right \nin that case. A seller is not compelled to accept early payment, \neven if it is only a day or two.  \n \n34.10. Risky things which may not be sold  \n \n34.10a. Not selling fruits or grain before they are ripe  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell fruits or grain whose ripeness \nhas not appeared, but it is permitted to sell them when the \nripeness of some of them has appeared, even if that is on \none palm tree among many.  \n \nThis refers to fruit on trees, like dates and grapes while they are \nstill green, or grain which has not developed, like wheat and broad \nbeans. It is not permitted because there is no legal use in the sale \nbefore ripeness appears. The appearance of the ripeness of dates is \nwhen they turn red or yellow. Its appearance in crops like grapes \nis when sweetness appears. The appearance in grain is that it is \ndry. Any contract formed before that is void.  \n \nIt is permitted to sell fruits when some of them are ripe, even one \npalm tree as long it is not a bakura, which is a tree which ripens \nwell before the others so that the goodness of the others does not \nimmediately follow it. It is not permitted to sell a garden on the \nbasis of the soundness of the fruit of such a tree, but the fruits of \nthat tree on its own can be sold.  \n \n34.10b. Not selling things which one does not have  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell fish which are still in rivers or \npools, nor can one sell a fetus still in its mother's womb, \nnor the fetus of what is in the wombs of other animals. It is \nnot permitted to sell the offspring of unborn camels nor to \nsell the sperm of male camels nor to sell a runaway slave or \nstray camel.  \n \nThe prohibition about fish is based on what Imam Ahmad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted about the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) forbidding buying fish still in water, i.e. due to \nuncertainty, and the uncertainty in it has two aspects. One is the \nlack of the ability to hand the fish over, and the fish might be little \nor large.  \n \nIt is also not permitted to sell a fetus, human or animal, because \nof the uncertainty since one does not know whether it will be born \nalive or dead, fully formed or not fully formed, male or female.  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell the offspring of unborn camels, and that \nis because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade such a \nsale, which is called habal al-habala. Ibn Wahb explained it as the \noffspring of a camel's offspring. It cannot be concealed that this \nentails great uncertainty. If it is forbidden to sell what is in the \nwomb, how can one sell the future offspring of what is in the \nwomb!  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell the sperm of camels since it is confirmed \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade selling the \nstud uses of a camel. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"If that is limited to a number of times or a period of time, then it \nis permitted. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that \nit is disliked because of its prohibition.  \n \nA runaway slave is not to be sold while he is on the run because of \nthe forbidden uncertainty. If he is resident or it is clear that he is \nno longer on the run, then it is permitted, i.e. when a time is \nstipulated as, for example, when he says, \"The end of his being on \nthe run is four days.\" Or it can be limited by place, as he says, \n\"His being on the run will end at Alexandria.\" The same ruling \napplies to stray camels because of the uncertainly about the \nability to get hold of them.  \n \n34.11 Dogs  \n \n34.11a It is not permitted to sell dogs  \n \nSelling dogs is forbidden. There is disagreement about \nwhether one can sell those dogs which are permitted to be \nkept.  \n \nThe prohibition derives from what is reported in Muslim where \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade the proceeds \nfrom the sale of dogs, money earned through prostitution and the \nearnings of a soothsayer. The disagreement is about dogs which \nare used as guard dogs and for hunting. There are two well-\npositions about whether that is permitted or prohibited.  \n \n34.11b. Liability for killing dogs  \n \nIf someone kills such a dog, he is liable for its price.  \n \nIf someone kills a dog it is permitted to keep, he must pay the \nprice according to the position that it is permitted to sell it. As for \ndogs not permitted to be kept, there is no price for such a dog.  \n \n34.12 Muzabana exchange  \n \nA sale of something which entails dealing with something whose \nweight, measure or number is unknown.  \n \n34.12a. It is not permitted to sell meat for a live animal  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell meat for a live animal of the same \nspecies.  \n \nThat is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nthat and because it is selling something known for something \nunknown, which is one meaning of muzabana. Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) considers the prohibition to be specific to \nmeat in exchange for a live animal of the same type, as the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) indicates here. The species in this case \nmeans the linguistic category for the type and the class, like \nselling beef, for instance, for sheep. In the Mukhtasar, the \nprohibition is limited to meat which has not been cooked. \nOtherwise it is permitted, as it is permitted to sell it for other \nthan its species, like selling mutton for birds.  \n \n34.12b. Combining  two sales in the same contract not \npermitted  \n \nIt is not permitted to have two sales in the same contract. \nThat is when someone can buys goods for either five in \ncash or ten on credit, and the sale becomes binding after \none of the two prices is paid.  \n \nIt is confirmed the that Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade that. There are two forms of that. One is when someone \nbuys the same goods for two prices. The Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) indicated that here, which is either paying five in cash or \nten on credit and the sale becomes binding once one price is paid. \nHe used the price to designate the sale as the price is one of the \nessential elements of the sale. The second form is to sell two \ndifferent commodities for one price, like a garment and a sheep, as \na requirement of the sale. The precondition for its being forbidden \nis because that becomes binding for one or both parties and \nbecause of the uncertainty entailed since the seller does not know \nthe price he was paid nor the seller what he paid. If it is not \nbinding, then it is permitted.  \n \n34.12c. Not selling dried fruits for fresh ones  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell dried dates for fresh ones, nor \nraisins for grapes, whether for disparate amounts or equal \namounts, nor any type of fresh fruit for the dried fruit of \nthe same type. This is muzabana which is forbidden.  \n \nThis cannot be done, either in similar or disparate amounts, since \nit is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was \nasked about selling dried dates for fresh ones and he asked, \"Do \ndried dates reduce in size when they are dried?\" \"Yes,\" they \nreplied. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Then no.\" Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"They are not sold.\" Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that there is no harm in that.  \n \nIt is also not permitted to sell raisins for grapes in disparate or \nequal amounts because there can be no equivalence in them, \nbecause when dried, the fresh may be more than the dried, or less \nor the same. This is uncertainty and lack of knowledge of actual \nequivalence, and is tantamount to actual disparity. Disparity is \nnot permitted because they are the same category. This applies to \nany sort of fresh fruit in exchange for dried. This would include \ngrains and any fruits which differ when they fresh from how they \nare when dried. He excludes different types because disparity is \npermitted when the two are different types.  \n \nMuzabana is forbidden, which here is selling something known for \nsomething unknown of the same type. We consider muzabana to \nbe confined to things susceptible to usury, even if the hadith \nwhich explains it uses something which is susceptible to usury.  \n \n34.12d. Not selling undetermined quantity for a determined \nquantity  \n \nOne does not sell an undetermined amount for a measured \namount of the same commodity, nor an undetermined \namount for an undetermined amount of the same category \nunless the difference between the two is clear and it is \nsomething in which disparity in the same category is \npermitted.  \n \nThis is like selling a heap of wheat whose measure is unknown for \na heap of wheat whose measure is unknown since it is muzabana \nwhen it is the same category. When the two categories are \ndifferent, that is permitted provided it is obvious, i.e. the two \ncategories are clearly different, be it selling an unknown for a \nknown or vice versa, whether or not the difference is evident. \nWhen it is clear that there is difference between the measured \nquantity and the unmeasured, or the unmeasured and the \nunmeasured, it is permitted to sell them if they are a category in \nwhich disparity is permitted. This cannot be done with something \nwhich is storable and a stable food, nor with gold or silver.  \n \n34.13 Selling Absent Goods  \n \n34.13a. Absent goods can be sold based on their description  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with selling an absent article \nbased on its description. Pre-payment is not to be \nstipulated unless its location is close or it is something safe \nfrom change, like a house, land or a tree. Pre-payment can \nbe made for these.  \n \nThis is according to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and his \npeople, with certain preconditions. One is that the item is \ndescribed. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \napparent meaning of his words is that if it is sold without a \ndescription and it not been seen, then it is not allowed. If it is, he \nhas an option to cancel when he sees it. That is what is stated in \nthe chapter on uncertainty in the Mudawwana.  \n \nThe second precondition is that someone other than the seller \ndescribes it because the seller is not reliable in his description \nsince he intends to augment its description so that the goods will \nsell. The precondition for its being described by other than the \nseller is when there is prepayment, even voluntarily. Otherwise, \nthe description of the seller is accepted as probable.  \n \nThe third precondition is that the goods are not very far away. \nThis is a precondition if the sale is definite. If there is an option to \ncancel, it is permitted because there is no harm to the buyer.  \n \nThe fourth is that pre-payment is not stipulated. It is forbidden \nbecause it is not possible to hand over the goods so that he pays \nthe price but does not receive the goods and thus it becomes a \nloan.  \n \n34.13b. Exceptions to forbidding prepayment  \n \nHe makes two exceptions to forbidding obliging pre-payment. One \nis when the absent goods are near to the place, whether it is \nanimals, commodities or immovable property, like a day or two. \nThe second exception is when the sale concerns one of the \ncategories mentioned. It is something which is safe from sudden \nchange, unlike the situation with animals. It is not permitted to \nmake a precondition for prepayment of categories subject to \nchange when they are located far away.  \n \n34.14 Slaves sold with an indemnification  \n \n34.14a. Indemnification ['uhda] is permitted in slaves  \n \nA guarantee is permitted in selling a slave when that is \nstipulated or it is the local custom. In the three day \nguarantee the seller is completely responsible for defects \nin that slave, and in a year's guarantee, he is only \nresponsible for insanity or either type of leprosy.  \n \nAn 'uhda is a contract in which responsibility for the goods \nremains that of the seller after the contract for a certain period. It \nis permitted in the case of slaves but not animals because a slave \nhas the ability to conceal his defects, which is not the case with \nother commodities, and he may be concealing a defect which the \nbuyer will dislike, and its concealment may be due to harm or \ndislike in the seller. The period of indemnification is set when it is \nstipulated in the contract or when the ruler obliges people to do \nthat. If none of this exists, then it is not set.  \n \nFor three days the seller is responsible for everything, even death, \ndrowning, burning or suicide. If the buyer finds an illness within \nthe three days, he can return the slave without evidence. If that \noccurs after three days, he must produce evidence that the slave \nhad that illness when he purchased him. The buyer is responsible \nfor the feeding and clothing of the slave in this period and any \nrevenue he earns in that period belongs to the buyer.  \n \nIn the year's guarantee, the seller is only liable for three things. \nOne is insanity, which is by jinn possession or nature, not due to a \nblow or rapture. He is not returned since it is possible to cure that \nby treatment which differs from the first two cases. The other two \nthings are the two forms of leprosy [whitening and that which \ninvolves mutilation]. The contract is specific to these diseases. \nThat is because their causes can exist while they only manifest \nthemselves at certain times of the year, as is the custom of Allah \nazza wa jall in the effect of that cause in that season. So the four \nseasons must be passed through, which is a full year, to show that \nhe is clear of these defects.  \n \n34.15 Sale with advance payment [salam]  \n \n34.15a Advance payment is permitted  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in advance payment [salam] for \ngoods, slaves, animals, food and condiments, provided the \ngoods have a known description and there is a set term of \ndelivery. The price is to be paid immediately, or with a \nshort delay of something like two or three days, if that is \nstipulated in the contract.  \n \nThis is also called salaf, and it is a term used to designate a type \nof sale in which what is purchased is not collected immediately. \nIts reality is that the price is advanced and delivery of the goods \npurchased delayed. The Book, Sunnah and consensus indicate \nthat it is allowed. The evidence in the Book is the words of Allah \nazza wa jall, \"Allah has permitted trade.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:274) As \nfor the Sunnah, it is reported in the two Sahih Collections that \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, 'When anyone pays in \nadvance for something, it must be for a specified measure and \nspecified weight for a specified term.\" The Community agree that \nit is permitted.  \n \nIt is allowed in the commodities he mentioned provided the goods \nfor which the advance is paid have a known category, amount and \nquality as he indicated. If the purchase is food, then its type must \nbe specified, either wheat, barley, or millet, or if it is fruit, it is \nspecified, whether raisins or dates. The amount is specified by \nwhatever is the custom in measure, weight, number or length or \nwhatever. The description must be specific. If it is food, he \nmentions what describes it. If is an animal, then the species is \nmentioned, its color, and whether it is male or female.  \n \nTwo things are considered about the term. It is must be known \nand it is a length of time in which market prices can change. Its \nminimum is half a month. It is not valid to give an advance for \nimmediately delivery according to what is common in the school.  \n \n34.15b. Preconditions of the payment  \n \nHe indicates preconditions of the payment, and that he must pay \nthe entire price because when he pays some and delays some, it is \ninvalid because it is a debt for a debt. There can be a short delay \nof a day or two if it is not stipulated that he pay cash when the \ncontract is made. It is permitted for the advance to be paid after \ntwo or three days. That is still considered immediate payment, \nand he mentions this specifically. His words would mean that if it \nis longer than that, such a precondition is not allowed.  \n \n34.15c. Delivery of the goods paid for in advance  \n \nWe prefer for the delivery of the goods paid for by advance \nto be fifteen days, or for it to be collected from another \ntown, even if that is two or three days distant. According to \nmore than one scholar, it is permitted to pay three days in \nadvance and collect it in the same town in which the \nadvance was paid. Others dislike that.  \n \nThat is because the market generally changes in such a period. It \nis clear that it is about that. That is like when he says, \"We prefer \nfor the length of the advance to be up to fifteen days.\" The school \nof Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is the term of the advance is \nthat in which something like it will change its price in markets \nwithout that being specifically defined. The subject of the \ndisagreement is when the price of the advance is paid when the \ngoods for which the advance is paid are in the same town. If each \nof them are in different towns, the term mentioned is not a \nprecondition, as he indicated.  \n \nIf the goods are in another town other than where the advance is \npaid, the distance between the two is the term for the advance, \nbecause usually there is a difference of prices in different places. It \ndoes not matter if it is only half a day.  \n \nSome scholars, including Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), allow \nthe advance in the same town, while others, like Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), dislike it.  \n \n34.15d. An advance cannot be with the same type of goods  \n \nIt is not permitted for the payment to consist of the same \ntype of goods as that for which the advance payment is \nmade. No advance is made of the same type or similar type \nof goods unless he lends him something to be repaid with \nsomething of the same quality and quantity, and the \nborrower enjoys the benefit.  \n \nThis is when the goods for which the advance is made are more \nthan the payment, like one qintar of iron for two qintars because \nthe object of an advance is to bring about a benefit. The same \nholds when it is less, like two garments for one garment of the \nsame type because it is a liability in exchange for a wage. When \nthe payment for the advance is similar to the goods in description \nand amount, it is permitted, as he states here, like donkeys for \nasses, or linen slaves for cotton slave because their uses are close.  \n \nAn exception to the prohibition against advancing a thing of the \nsame type is a loan which is repaid with its like. The borrower \nenjoys the use, but it is not permitted for the lender to be the one \nwho benefits.  \n \n34.16. Exchange of debts  \n \n34.16a. It is not permitted to sell a debt for a debt.  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell a debt for a debt.  \n \nIt is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nselling an outstanding debt for an outstanding debt. The people of \nlanguage say that that means a delayed payment for a delayed \npayment, meaning a debt in exchange for a debt. According to the \nfuqaha', it denotes three things: selling a debt for a debt, \ncontracting a debt in exchange for a debt, and abrogating one debt \nby another debt. So the expression, \"selling a debt for a debt\" has \ntwo applications which includes three forms.  \n \n34.16b. A forbidden aspect  \n \nOne form of that is to stipulate delay of payment for the \nsalam sale until the goods are delivered, or to delay \npayment more than three days after the contract.  \n \nPayment of the salam cannot be set for more than three days after \nthe contract. It is part of \"a debt for a debt\" because it prolongs the \nresponsibilities of both.  \n \n34.16c. Not canceling one debt by another debt  \n \nNor is it permitted to cancel one debt by another debt. \nThat is when someone owes you something and you cancel \nit by allowing him to pay you something else at a latter \ndate.  \n \nAn example of this is that he owes you ten dinars on a year's \ncredit. Then cancel it for ten garments, for instance. If the \ncancellation is at the term or shorter than it, there are two \npositions. One is that is permitted, which appears to be most \nlogical. It is also said that it is forbidden, and that is the better \nknown position.  \n \n34.17 Sale of goods one does not have  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell something which you do not have \nif it is stipulated that you must deliver it immediately.  \n \nIf it is clear that if he wants immediate delivery. This is when he \nsells something for which he is responsible and does not have and \nso he must go to the market and buy it and then hand it over to \nthe buyer. This entails risk and uncertainty, because he may or \nmay not find it, and if he does find it, he will buy it for more than \nthe price for which he sold and must make up the price himself, \nand is forbidden foolishness, or he buys it for less and consumes \nthe rest falsely, which is not permitted.  \n \n34.18 Reversal of sale on time  \n \nWhen you sell some goods to be paid for later, you may not \nbuy them back by paying in cash less than you sold it for or \nby taking a shorter term to pay for it than the term given \nto the original buyer, nor can you pay more for it or take a \nlonger term to pay for it than the original term. It is \npermitted to buy it at the original date, and that is fair \nexchange [muqassa].  \n \nThe sale in the first example is when he sells a garment for ten \ndirhams for a month and then buys it for five in cash. The \nexample of the second is that he sells it to him for one hundred for \na month and then buys it for fifty for fifteen days. Both cases are \nforbidden because they entail a loan in exchange for an increase \nbecause he pays a little in order to take more than it.  \n \nAnother case is when you sell goods for a price on credit. You \ncannot then buy them back for more than the price, as when a \nman sells goods for one hundred for a month and then buys them \nfor one hundred fifty for two months because that entails a debt \nfor a debt. If you sell goods for a price on credit and then buy them \nfor a price on credit for the same term, that is permitted whether \nthe price is more or less or the same, because there is no reason to \nbe on guard. Fair exchange is when you see goods for one hundred \nfor a month and then buy it for one hundred on credit. This is \nresponsibility for one hundred. So at the end there is one hundred \nfor one hundred.  \n \n34.19 Buying in undetermined amounts [juzaf]  \n \n34.19a It is permitted to buy in unmeasured amounts  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in buying undetermined amounts \nof things which can be measured or weighed, except for \ndinars and dirhams which are minted. It is, however, \npermitted in the case of pieces of gold and silver.  \n \n\"Undetermined\" means not weighed, measured or counted. \n\"Nothing wrong\" means it is permitted. In the Sahih we read that \nthe Companions, may Allah azza wa jall be pleased with all them, \nsold fruits in undetermined amounts. It is, however, forbidden to \nsell minted dinars and dirhams in undetermined amounts because \nthat is part of what contains risk and gambling. It is permitted \nwith pieces of gold and silver unless they are used for currency. \nWhen they are used as currency, then it is not permitted to do \nthat.  \n \n34.19b. Things which can be easily counted are not sold \nuncounted  \n \nIt is not permitted to buy slaves and garments in \nundetermined amounts, nor other things which can be \ncounted without difficulty.  \n \nThis would also be like two gardens. It is easy to count small \nnumbers.  \n \n34.20. Right to the accessories of items sold  \n \n34.20a. Pollinated palms and crops  \n \nIf someone sells date palms after they have been \npollinated, the fruit belongs to the seller unless the buyer \nstipulates that is part of the sale. It is the same with other \ntypes of fruit. Pollinating [ibar] is using the male blossoms \nto pollinate the female, but in respect of crops, it means \nwhen they spout from the soil.  \n \nThis is when all or most trees have been pollinated. The fruit still \nbelongs to the seller unless it is part of the contract. This is a \ngeneral principle which applies to all sorts of fruit, like grapes and \nolives. Pollination of palms means to put pollen on the fruit from \nthe male palm tree. In other than palms, like peaches and figs, it \nis when the fruits begin to grow so that they can be seen. The \nwell-known position about crops is that it is when they start to \nemerge. So if someone buys sowed land in which has not yet \nappeared, he obtains the seeds in it.  \n \n34.20b. A slave's possessions  \n \nIf someone sells a slave who owns some property, that \nproperty belongs to the seller, unless the buyer stipulates \notherwise.  \n \nHe stipulates it for the slave, not for himself. If he stipulates it for \nhimself, that it is forbidden if the price was gold or silver, and the \nproperty is gold or silver.  \n \n34.21 Examining items  \n \n34.21a Buying items unseen but described  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in buying what is bags with a \nknown description on rosters.  \n \nThis is permitted. Even though the basis is forbidden, it is \npermitted because of the difficulty and hardship entailed for the \nseller in untying the bags which may sully what is in itself and be \na great burden if the buyer is not satisfied. So the description \ntakes the place of actual seeing. What is meant by rosters is a \nwritten description. If he finds the contents to be what is on the \nroster, then the sale is binding and the buyer has no option to \ncancel. If he finds that the contents are different, he has an option \nto make the sale binding or cancel it.  \n \n34.21b. What one cannot buy without seeing it  \n \nIt is not permitted, however, to buy cloth which is not \nunfolded nor described nor to buy if it is a dark night \nwhen the buyer and seller cannot see it or know what is in \nit. The same holds for buying an animal on a dark night.  \n \nLiterally it would mean that if it is described, it is permitted. The \nwell-known position is that it is not permitted because there is no \nhardship involved in bringing it out and unfolding it. His words \nmight also give rise to the impression that if it is a moonlit night, \nit permitted. According to the Mudawwana it is absolutely not \npermitted, whether it is a dark or moonlit night.  \n \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) also says that about \nselling flock animals. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) makes \na distinction about that whose meat is eaten, which can be sold \nsince it possible to test it at night by touching it with the hand to \nclarify the aim of it being fat or lean.  \n \n34.22 Bidding  \n \n34.22a. No bidding when a sale is about to be concluded  \n \nNo one should bid against his brother's bid when the two \nparties are satisfied and near to closing a deal, but he can \ndo so at the beginning of the bidding.  \n \nA sale is finalized verbally, even if the two parties have not \nphysically separated.  \n \nIt is forbidden when the buyer and seller are close to agreement \nand only the finalization remains. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that bidding in sales to seeking to increase the price.  \n \nWe believe that sales are concluded by a verbal agreement, or \nwhat indicates it, like a gesture or handing over, even if they have \nnot separated. The hadith says that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"The buyer and seller have the option as long as \nthey have not separated.\" Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes \nthe separation to be by words. \n  \nThen he begins to discuss transactions which resemble sales.  \n \n34.23. Hiring services by time, piece-work and renting  \n \n34.23a. Hiring services is permitted  \n \nHiring services [ijara] is permitted when the two parties \nset the length of time and the payment.  \n \nIn a hadith, we read that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"I will be the antagonist of three people on the Day of Rising: \na man who makes a covenant in My name and then betrays it, a \nman who sells a free man and then consumes the money he gets \nfor him, and a man who hires an employee and gets full work from \nhim and then does not pay him his wages.\" This hadith is in the \ntwo Sahih Collections. The apparent meaning of the words is that \nthere must be a term set for every employment, but that is not the \ncase when the types of employment do not need a term. It is work \nwhose end is when it is finished, like sewing and weaving. Naming \nthe payment is necessary, as Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said. When it is not named, that is not allowed unless it is \nsomething common which does not vary, and then it is permitted.  \n \n34.23b. Piece-work jobs  \n \nNo term is fixed in a contract to recover a runaway slave \nor a lost camel, or to dig a well, to sell a garment or similar \nthings. He receives nothing until the work is complete.  \n \nIt is not set because that would increase the uncertainty about \nwage since the term pay pass before the work is complete and so \nhis work will be for nothing, or he make take what he is not \nentitled to if the work is complete before the end of the term. A \npiece-work job can consist of many things, like the cases \nmentioned here.  \n \nSomething similar is stated in the Mukhtasar. Shaikh Bahram \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It may be something in which the \ncontractor only obtains a useful benefit when the work is \ncomplete. How will he obtain that benefit if the work is not \ncomplete? He must receive an amount which he benefits by. An \nexample of that if when he looks for a runaway slave in one area \nand does not find him there, there is some benefit for the \ncontractor because he knows that he is not that area.\" It is \nunderstood from the words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand the Mukhtasar that when the work is not complete, he gets \nnothing, and that is the case. That is the case since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is a camel load for the \none who brings it.\"  \n \n34.23c Someone hired to sell something by the end of a \nterm  \n \nIf someone is hired to sell something by the end of a term \nand he still has not sold it at the end of the time, he is \nentitled to his full wage. If he sells it after half the term, he \nonly receives half the wage.  \n \nThis is when he is hired to sell a specific item. The reason for this \nis that when the hire is connected to uses, each of part of it is in \nreturn for a part of the uses. If it is said that it was already stated \nthat no term can be put on a job whereas here he mentions the \nend of the term and so this is a contradiction, the answer is that it \nis not a contradiction because before he was speaking about piece-\nwork and here it is hire, which is not allowed without a term as \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated. \n \n34.23d Renting [kira']  \n \nRenting is like selling as far what is lawful or unlawful is \nconcerned. If someone rents a particular riding animal to \ngo to a certain place and the animal dies, the rest of the \nhire is canceled. It is the same when an employee dies, or \nwhen a house is rented but collapses before the end of the \nterm.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that renting [kira'] \nis used for that which is without intelligence and hiring (ijara) is \nfor that with intelligence. It resembles sales in respect of having a \nknown term and known rent, and in being forbidden without a \nknown term and the like. The difference between hire and rent \nbegins with his description of renting a riding animal. It indicates \nthat renting is used for selling the use of an animal which has no \nunderstanding. He calls an employee ajir, because he has \nintelligence.  \n \nRenting the use of an animal is like when he says, \"Rent me this \nanimal,\" which he points at it, \"so that I can use it for travel to a \ncertain place.\" If the animal then dies, or is confiscated or claimed, \nthe rent is canceled and he pays for the distance he has traveled, \nwithout consideration for the first rent because it might be cheap \nor expensive.  \n \nIf an employee is hired for a particular job for a known period to \nwork in a house or tend sheep, the same ruling as that of the \nanimal applies. The rest of the hire is canceled. The same applies \nwhen all or part of a house collapses or there is great harm in it or \nits burns or is claimed before the end of the rent, whether the rent \nis monthly or yearly. It is canceled and he pays for the time he \nlived there.  \n \n34.23e Teachers and doctors  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in a teacher teaching the Holy \nQur'an being paid when the student has mastered it and \nfor a doctor to be to be employed provides he cures the \npatient.  \n \n It is permitted to employ someone to teach the Holy Qur'an to \nchildren until they master it, i.e. memorize it, all or part. There is \nalso no harm in hiring a doctor who is paid when he cures the \npatient.  \n \n34.23f The death of a renter does not end the rental  \n \nThe rental of an animal or house does not end with the \ndeath of the renter nor does not the hire of a shepherd end \nby the death of the sheep. The sheep should be replaced \nwith a similar flock.  \n \nThat is because the item rented remains and the heirs can rent it \nfor its like or less. In the case a shepherd, if he is not given a new \nflock, he is paid the full wage.  \n \n34.23g. When a rented animal dies  \n \nIf someone rents out an animal with a guarantee and then \nthe animal dies, he should provide another. If the rider \ndies, the rental is not canceled and his heirs must hire \nanother rider.  \n \nAn example is when he says, \"Rent me an animal I can use to get \nto such-and-such a place.\" If the animal dies, the one who rented it \nto him must replace it because the uses are his responsibility and \nnot connected to this particular animal. If the rider dies, i.e. when \nsomeone rents an animal and pays for it and then dies, the rent is \nnot canceled. His heirs rent the animal for someone who is like \nhim in ability and condition.  \n \n34.23h Destruction of implements  \n \nIf someone rents a household implement or something else, \nhe is not liable for it if it is destroyed or lost while in his \npossession. His word is believed about that until it can be \nproven that he is lying.  \n \n\"Implement\" [ma'un] is a general term for utensils in the house, \nlike pots, platters, axes, and sieves. \"Something else\" would be like \na garment or riding animal. If he says it is destroyed, the one who \nrented is believed unless there is evidence to the contrary and \nthen he is liable. This is like when he says, \"It was destroyed at \nthe beginning of the month,\" and then it is seen with him after \nthat. It is understood by \"in his possession\" that if he removes it \nfrom his possession and it was destroyed by someone else, he is \nliable since he rented it to someone not trustworthy or someone \nheavier or more injurious than him.  \n \n34.23i Artisans' responsibility  \n \nArtisans are responsible for things they lose, whether they \nare working for a wage or not.  \n \nArtisans are those who set themselves up to work for their \nlivelihood, like tailors. They are responsible for the value of things \nthey lose, assessed on the day they took possession of those things, \nand receive no wage for the work they did on them, i.e. because \nthey are responsible for the value of the item before any work \ndone on it. It states in the Mawwaziyya, \"The owner cannot say, 'I \nwill pay the wage and take its value after the work.'\" Shaikh ibn \nRushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Unless the artisan confirms \nthat he lost it after the work was done.\"  \n \n34.23j Bath house owners  \n \nThe owner of a public bath house is not liable [for \nbelongings lost by clients].  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that his words mean \nthat he is renting out and is not a guard for the clothing. Abdullah \nibn Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated the opposite of this. He \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that the owner of a bath house is a guard \nof the belongings, whether he guards them for a fee or without a \nfee. This is where they are stolen or destroyed by the command of \nAllah azza wa jall. As for when he says, \"A man came and asked \nfor them and I thought that he was their owner and so I gave \nthem to him,\" then he is liable. The same applies when he says, \"I \nsaw the one who took them and I thought that he was their \nowner.\" Shaikh ibn al-Musayyab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The \nowner of the bath house is responsible, and that is what Imam \nAbu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \n34.23k Ship owners  \n \nThe owner of a ship is not liable [for lost cargo or damage]. \nA ship owner is not paid his hire until he delivers his \ncargo.  \n \nHe is not liable for the ship floundering because of wind or waves. \nHe does not receive his hire until he delivers the cargo because the \nfee for the ship is one that of hire. If the aim is not achieved, the \nfare is not deserved. It is said that he is paid a fare according to \nhow far the ship traveled. That seems likely because it is more \nappropriate to connect the rent of the ship to hire than to connect \nit to piece-work because the end is known and the wage is known \nand so he is paid according to the distance traveled.  \n \n34.24 Partnership of labor and capital  \n \n34.24a. Partnership of labor  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in a having partnership in physical \nlabor when the partners work in the same place with the \nsame work, or do work that is similar.  \n \nIt is the permission of each of the two partners to work together. \nThe evidence for that is in the Sahih from Zuhra ibn Ma'bad \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu). He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) used to go out to the \nmarket with his grandfather to buy food. Abdullah ibn Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and ibn az-Zubayr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) would \nmeet him and say to him, \"Be our partner. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) prayed for you to have blessing,\" so he \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) would be their partner. Often he would get a \ncamel's load as profit and sent it home.  \n \nThey work in the same place with the same work. This is the \nposition of the Mudawwana. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) explains it as being well-known. The 'Utbiyya allows it to be \nin several places when the work they do is the same. The author of \nthe Mukhtasar says that it well-known. The same sort of work is \nlike two tailors. \"Close\" means that the work of one of them \ndepends on the work of the other, as when one prepares the \nspinning to be woven and the other does the weaving. When the \nwork is different and not similar, like a tailor and blacksmith, \npartnership is not permitted because of the uncertainty since the \nwork of this one rather than that one may be sold and he will take \nwhat he is not entitled to from his companion.  \n \n34.24b. Partnership of capital  \n \nA partnership in pooled capital is permitted provided the \nprofit is shared between according to the size of the \ninvestment of each of them. The work of each is also in \nproportion to percentage of the profit stipulated for him. It \nis not permitted to share the profit equally if their \ninvestments differ.  \n \nCapital partnership is in dinars and dirhams invested by both \nsides by consensus, and by food with the same description and \ncategory according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwhile Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) forbade that, i.e. forbade \nthat with the same description, category and amount, let alone \ndifferent ones.  \n \nWhen it is said that it is permitted, the profit shared between \nthem and the work is in proportion to the size of the investment. \nFor instance, if one of them pays 100 and the other 200, the profit \nand loss is divided into thirds between them.  \n \n34.25 Investment loans [qard]  \n \n34.25a. Investment loans [qirad] are made with money  \n \nAn investment loan [qirad] is permitted with dirhams and \ndinars, and it is also allowed with unminted gold and \nsilver.  \n \nThere are certain preconditions for a qirad. One is that it be in \ngold or silver, whether that is done by number or weight.   \n \n34.25b. Investment loans are not made in merchandise  \n \nA qirad made in goods is not permitted. In such a case, the \nborrower is like an employee who sells them. If he then \ntrades with the price, this then becomes an investment \nloan.  \n \nAn investment loan cannot be in any weighed or measured things \nbecause the basic root of the qirad is uncertainty because the \nwage is unknown since the agent does not know whether or not he \nwill have a profit. Its amount is according to the profit. The \ninvestor does not know whether there is a profit or not and \nwhether or not he will get his capital back. That is uncertainty \nbecause of these aspects. However the Lawgiver allowed it out of \nnecessity since the people needed to transact trade with it. That \namount of it which the Lawgiver permitted is what is permitted. It \nconsists of minted cash or what has the same ruling in the form of \npieces of gold and silver.  \n \nIf this actually happens, then the agent becomes an employee. \nWhen he trades with the price, that is a qirad. It says in the \nMukhtasar that his wage is the like of what he would get for \nselling the goods. As for his work in the qirad after that, he has \nthe profit from such a qirad, if there is a profit. Otherwise he has \nnothing.  \n \nThen he explained the matters over which the agent has control \nrather than the investor.  \n \n34.25c Expenses  \n \nThe agent has a right to clothing and food if he travels \nwith a considerable amount of capital. He is only entitled \nto clothing for a long trip.  \n \nThis is mandatory. What is meant are his expenses for a return \njourney, with two conditions. One is the journey, and it must be \none by which he intends to make the investment grow. If he \ntravels with it to visit his family or to go on hajj, he is not entitled \nto any expenses. The other is that the capital is considerable. The \njourney can be short or long in respect of food. There is no clothing \nentitlement for a short journey when the money is a lot and not \njust a little. A short journey is the distance of up to ten days and \nthe definition of a lot of property is fifty dinars or more.  \n \n34.25d Division of profits  \n \nThe profit is not divided until the capital is in cash.  \n \nIt means that it converted to gold or silver. A example of that is \nwhen he sells some goods and still has some which is the capital. \nIf he is told to then divide that which is cash, that is not permitted \nbecause the remaining goods may be destroyed.  \n \n34.26 Leasing an orchard or plantation [musaqa]  \n \n34.26a. A musaqa is permitted  \n \nLeasing an orchard or plantation of trees is permitted, \nprovided that the two parties agree on the shares.  \n \nIt means that someone hands over his grapevines or date palms, \nfor instance, to someone who attends to whatever they require of \nirrigation and work on the basis that the crop which Allah azza \nwa jall grants is divided in half between them or for a known \nportion of the fruit, like a third or a fourth. Its ruling is that it is \npermitted according to what is in the two Sahih Collections which \nstates that Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) employed the \npeople of Khaybar for half of what it produced of fruits or crops. It \nis an exception to arable sharecropping, which is renting out land \nfor what is produces, selling fruits and hiring them before they are \ngood and before they exist, which is part of hire for something \nunknown.  \n \nIt has certain preconditions. There must be two parties, and they \nmust be capable of hire. The expression saqa [whose root is \nirrigation] is used, and it is not contracted for mutual trade and \nthe like. It made on immovable property [i.e. the trees] and it \nwould appear that it is not permitted in anything else. This is not \nthe case. It is valid for in the case of crops like sugar cane, onions \nand cucumbers with certain conditions. One is that the owner of \nthe crops is unable to attend to them. The second is that he fears \nthe crop will die due to lack of irrigation. The third is that it has \nappeared from the ground. The fourth is that its ripeness has not \nyet appeared because then it would be permitted to sell it and so \nthere is no need for musaqa. Part it is that he does it for known \nportion, whether a lot like two-thirds, or a little, like a fourth.  \n \nThey must agree on the division of the shares. If he does it for \ncertain number of sa's or wasqs, that is not permitted.  \n \n34.26b The labor is done by the lessee  \n \nAll the work is done by the lessee. No other work can be \nstipulated for him other than that entailed by the musaqa \n[irrigation] and nor is he required to start any work in the \norchard unless it is of no consequence, like mending a \nfence and repairing a reservoir, without that involving \nactually initiating the work.  \n \nThe work consists of tending to what the fruits require in the form \nof irrigation, pollination, fertilization, pruning, and repairing tools \nin the form of buckets, spades, and so forth. The owner cannot \nstipulate other work, like buying a garment for him and similar \njobs which have nothing to do with the fruit. He cannot stipulate \ninitiating any new work unless it is inconsequential, like mending \nan existing fence of the garden or mending the reservoir. It is not \npermitted to stipulate that he build it from scratch because that \nwill remain after the fruit.  \n \n34.26c Tasks which can be stipulated  \n \nPollination of the trees is done by the lessee as well as \ncleaning the places where the water settles among the \ntrees, mending the place where the water falls from the \nbucket, cleaning the water source and similar tasks.  \n \nPollination is buying what is used for fertilization and attaching it \nto the trees. That is the school. Cleaning the water source is to \nremove dirt or leaves from it. Similar tasks include pruning and \ndrying.  \n \n34.26d Work animals may not be removed  \n \nThe musaqa does not permit the expulsion of animals in \nthe orchard. If some of them die, then the owner must \nreplace them. The lessee must maintain the animals and \nthe employees.  \n \nThe Mudawwana states that the owner of the garden cannot grant \nthe musaqa contract and then stipulate the removal of any of the \nslaves or animals from the garden. Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"This is a prohibition, not simple dislike.\" If animals \nin the garden die, the owner must replace them, even if the \nworker has not stipulated that because the contract is based on \nwork on that which is the responsibility of the owner of the garden \nin respect to those animals on which the contract occurred when \nthey are in the garden. If the owner stipulates that the agent has \nto replace them, that is not allowed. The agent must fodder the \nanimals and clothe and feed the employees according to the well-\nknown position because he owes the work and all the burdens \nconnected to it.  \n \n34.26e Cultivating un-planted parts of the orchard  \n \nThe lessee should cultivate the unplanted area if it is \nslight, but there is no harm in leaving that up to the lessee, \nand this is the most lawful course. If there is a lot of \nunplanted land, it is not permitted to include it in the \nmusaqa contract of the orchard. It can only be included if \nis it is a third or less of the orchard.  \n \nUn-planted land is land which is free of trees. A third or less is a \nslight amount. The owner can cancel that. If it is a lot, he is not \npart of the musaqa of the palm trees.  \n \nSo a small area of unplanted land can be part of the musaqa with \nthe above preconditions. If it is not mentioned or stipulated in the \ncontract, it is the responsibility of the agent. The contract is void if \nthe owner stipulates that it is his if the agent irrigates it, as the \ncontract is void is it includes a lot of unplanted land or it is \nstipulated that it belongs to the agent [in the case of palm trees]. \nIt belongs to the owner. As far as a lot or a little is concerned, it is \nin respect of all the fruits, not in respect to the share of the agent \nalone.  \n \n34.27 A farming partnership  \n \n34.27a Sharecropping is permitted  \n \nIt is permitted to have a sharecropping partnership if both \nparties share in the cultivation and the profit is shared \nbetween them, whether one owns the land and the other \ndoes the work, or the work and rent are shared between \nthem, or they both own the land.  \n \nSome call it muzara'a. The Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentioned eight cases in this topic: four are permitted, three are \nmentioned in order and the fourth delayed, and four are forbidden, \none of which is understood and three are stated.  \n \nAs for the three which are permitted, he mentioned the first here, \nwhich is when one owns the land and the other does the work. \nThat is when there is equality with the rent of the land in value, \nor close to it, as when the value of the land is 19 and the work 20 \nor the reverse. If they are far apart, it is not permitted.  \n \nThe second is when the work and rent are shared between them.  \n \nThe third is when they both own the land.  \n \nThen he moves to the forbidden three cases which are mentioned:  \n \n34.27b Forbidden forms of sharecropping  \n \nIf one provides the seeds and the other owns the land, with \nthe profit to be shared between them, that is not permitted, \nwhether one or both do the work.  \n \nOne case is when one of them provides the seed and the other the \nland and the work. Another case is when one of them provides the \nseed and the work and the other the land. The third case is when \none provides the land and the seed and they both do the work.  \n \nThen he indicates the fourth of the permitted cases and says:  \n \n34.27c Another permitted form  \n \nIf they both rent the land and the seed comes from one and \nthe work from the other, it is permitted if the values of the \ntwo undertakings are close.  \n \nOr it is jointly owned, or it belongs to one and the other pays him \nthe rent for half. This is when the cost of the seeds and the work \nare close. If they are not close then it is not permitted. That is the \nfourth forbidden case.  \n \n34.27d. Rental of land with uncertain irrigation  \n \nNo payment is made on renting land whose irrigation is \nuncertain until it is watered.  \n \nThis is like land watered by rain and land with a small spring. If \nirrigation is secure, like land watered by a river near a large sea, \nand like land watered by rain in the east, then when the contract \nof rental is made, it can be paid, even if it is for a long time, like \n30 years.  \n \n34.28 Liability for damage to crops sold and not yet \nclaimed  \n \n34.28a The effect of damage to crops  \n \nIf anyone buys fruit still on the trees, and then a third or \nmore of it is destroyed by cold, locusts, frost or something \nelse, the cost of that is deducted from the price the buyer \npays. If it is less than a third, then the buyer bears the loss.  \n \nHe buys the fruit after it appears but before it is fully ripe. Other \nthings which can damage the crop are like wind, snow, armies and \nthieves. It is related by Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When a man \nbuys fruits and then blight befalls it and a third of the fruit is lost, \nthe liability is obliged for the owner.\" This is when the cause is \nother than lack of water. When it is due to lack of water, then \nthere is no limit. It is reduced, be it a little or a lot, whether they \nare watered from spring or by rain because irrigation is the \nresponsibility of the seller, and is part of the discharge of his \nresponsibility.  \n \n \n34.28b When there is no reduction  \n \nThere is no crop damage in a crop or what is bought after \nthe fruit has been dried.  \n \nThat is because it is only sold after it is dry. The delay until after \nit has been dried is neglect on the part of the buyer.  \n \n34.28c Damage to vegetables  \n \nThere is a reduction in crop damage to vegetables, even if \nit is little. It is also said that there is only a reduction if a \nthird is damaged.  \n \nThis is like onions and chard because the damage is usually due to \nlack of water.  \n \n34.29 Gift of fruit which can be dried ['ariyya]  \n \n34.29a The 'ariyya  \n \nIf someone gives a man an 'ariyya [a grant] of the fruit of \npalm trees from his garden, there is no harm in him buying \nthem when they are ripe in exchange for dry dates, based \non estimation of their measure.  \n \nThis is when he gives someone – whether a man, woman or child – \nthe fruits as an 'ariyya, which is granting him the crop which is \nstill on those trees. It is not valid if it is a simple gift. When they \nare ripe, the giver can buy then by estimating their measure. The \nform of that is that it is said, \"How much is on this palm tree of \nwasqs?\" It is said, \"It is five or more.\" Then it is asked, \"How much \nwill that be reduced when they are dried?\" and the reply is a wasq \nor more. If something like five wasqs or less remain after that, it \nis allowed, and if it is than that, it is not permitted in exchange for \ndried dates of the same type.  \n \n34.29b When they are cut  \n \nHe given that when they are cut, if it is five wasqs or less. \nIt is not permitted to buy more than five wasqs except with \nmoney or merchandise.  \n \nThis is not meant that it is not a precondition that it is immediate. \nThey either agree to full payment when they are cut or are silent \non it. A precondition of immediate payment might entail harm. As \nfor immediate payment without it is being stipulated, there is no \nharm. The limitation of five or less only applies to one who \ngranted the 'ariyya. He can buy them with cash or goods. \n \n  \n \nChapter 35. Bequests and Freeing Slaves \n \n[Tadbir, Kitaba, Emancipation, the umm walad and wala']  \n \n \nThere are six topics in this chapter, each of which has a reality, a \nruling and other matters.  \n \nThe first concerns bequests [wasaya]. In the usage of the fuqaha' \nit is a contract which creates entitlements to the third of his estate \nwhich a person can dispose of and which become binding when he \ndies. They disagree about whether that is obligatory or \nrecommended. Most scholars think that it is mandatory, as is \nexpressed here.  \n \n35.1 Bequests  \n \n35.1a The right to make a bequest  \n \nIt is imperative for someone who has property to prepare a \nwill.  \n \nIt should be witnessed. If it is not witnessed, it is invalid, even if it \nis found in his writing unless he says, \"Carry out the document \nyou find in my handwriting.\" Then it is carried out.  \n \n35.1b No bequest to a heir  \n \nThere can be no bequest in favor of an heir.  \n \nHe either means the fact that it is not sound or that it is simply \nprohibited, The position of the School is that it is not valid, even if \nit is less than a third. If the other heirs do allow, it is made a gift \nfrom him.  \n \n35.1c Bequests are from the disposable third  \n \nBequests are made from the disposable third. Anything \nwhich exceeds that is rejected unless the heirs allow it.  \n \nThat which the person who makes a will can dispose of is a third, \nor it means that the one making the will cannot dispose of more \nthan a third. If it is more than a third, even a small amount, it is \nonly allowed by the permission of the heirs when they are sane \nand adult.  \n \nThe third is calculated on the day of death, not the day when the \nwill is read, according to what Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) states. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ncounters him by saying that it is contrary to the school. \"What the \nSchool considers in the bequest is that it is taken from the third \non the day the bequests are carried out, not the day of death, so \nthat if the third covers all the bequests on the day he dies and \nthen a blight befalls the property and destroys some of it so that \nthe third does not cover them, then the ruling on the day of the \ndivision is that of someone who has willed away more than a \nthird. I do not know of any disagreement about that in the school.\"  \n \n35.1d Emancipation takes priority  \n \nIn the disposable third, one begins with freeing a \nparticular slave.  \n \nHe deals with the order with which one deals with bequests. The \nfirst is the emancipation of a particular slave, whether he owns \nthat slave or someone else owns him, as when he says, \"Buy the \nslave of so-and-so and free him.\" We mentioned that this is first in \nthe bequests, but when there is a bequest about unpaid zakat or \nkaffarah, that takes precedence over emancipation.  \n \n35.1e The order of precedence  \n \nNext is priority freeing a mudabbar when the tadbir \ndeclaration was made when the master was healthy. This \nprecedes emancipation or any other bequests made when \nhe was ill, including unpaid zakat.  \n \nA bequest to pay zakat is taken from the third before other \nbequests, but a tadbir made when the master was healthy \ntakes precedence over it.  \n \nIf he did not mention unpaid zakat in the will, it is not paid from \nthe third.  \n \n35.1f When there is not enough in the third to cover all \nbequests  \n \nIt the third is not enough for then the people of shares who \nhave no precedence receive proportional shares of the rest.  \n \nThis is the same principle as 'awl [adjustment] in shares of \ninheritance. For instance, take the case when the deceased willed \none man half of his property and another a quarter. You compare \nthe position of the half and the fourth and see what is between \nthem and you find that the common factor is a quarter. You take \nthe half and fourth and combine them and so they are three and \nyou know the third is divided into three shares between them, one \nshare for the one with a fourth and two for the one with a half. \nThis is when the heirs do not allow the bequests. If they allow \nthem, then the one with the bequest takes the half and the other a \nfourth, and the rest is taken by the heirs.  \n \n35.1g Revoking a bequest  \n \nA man may revoke his bequest of emancipation or other \nthings.  \n \nEven if he is a fool and whether he is healthy or ill. The same \napplies to women and children, He can retract a bequest whether \nhe is healthy or ill, as it states in Tahqiq al-Mabani from Shaikh \nal-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nShaikh \nBahram \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He can retract it, even if he testified in his \nwill that he would not retract it. That is the 'amal in this.  \n \n35.2 Tadbir: an undertaking to free a slave at the master's \ndeath or a certain date  \n \n35.2a. Definition of tadbir  \n \nA tadbir is contracted when a man says to his slave, \"You \nare mudabbar\" or \"You are free afterwards,\" [i.e. after my \ndeath]  \n \nTaken the departure (idbar or dabr) of life. The root means what \nis behind something. Tadbir is recommended. One of its \npreconditions is the form with which it is made, like saying, \"You \nare free after my death\" or \"You are free on the day I die.\" The \nslave must be of age to be considered responsible and sane. It is \nnot sound to grant it to a mad person or a child even if he has \ndiscrimination.  \n \n35.2b Status of a mudabbar slave  \n \nThen he is not permitted to sell such slave, but he is still \nentitled to his work and, as long as the master is not ill, he \ncan confiscate the slave's possessions. If it is a slavegirl, he \ncan have intercourse with her.  \n \nIf he sells such a slave, the sale is invalid and the slave remains a \nmudabbar as long as the sale is not connected to emancipation. If \nit is connected to emancipation and the buyer emancipates him, \nhe is free and he has his wala', i.e. if he sets him free while the \nmaster is alive. If the sale is carried out with emancipation, the \none who set free has the wala'. If he is freed after the death of the \none of the one gave him the tadbir, it is not carried out because \nthe wala' is connected to the one who granted the tadbir.  \n \nThe master is entitled to his work until he dies because he is his \nmaster. If the master is ill and may die, he cannot confiscate the \nslave's property because that is removing his property for someone \nelse.  \n \nHe can have intercourse with a slavegirl because the basic \nprinciple is that she is allowed. If she becomes pregnant, she \nbecomes a umm walad who is freed from his main estate [rather \nthan from the disposable third] after his death.  \n \n35.2c A slavegirl due to be freed at a certain time  \n \nHe cannot have intercourse with a slavegirl who will be set \nfree a certain date nor can he sell her. He can demand her \nwork and can confiscate her possessions as long as the \nterm for her emancipation is not near.  \n \nThis is like when he says, \"Serve me for a year and then you are \nfree\" because the term may come before his death and so she will \nbe free. If he has intercourse with her she may become pregnant \nand then would only be free after his death [as a umm walad]. \nSuch a relationship in this case resembles a mu'ta marriage [a \ntemporary marriage because it has a term at which it ends]. If a \nslavegirl has a term fixed for her, he must not have intercourse \nwith her, or give her away or give her as charity because she has \none of the contracts of emancipation.  \n \nThe Hashiyat al-'Adawi notes that if he does have intercourse \nwith her, he is disciplined for that, but is not subject to a hadd \npunishment.  \n \nShe can work for him since she is still his property until the end of \nthe term. He can confiscate her possessions which she has, for \ninstance as a gift from him, but this is restricted to when the term \nof emancipation is not near. There is no definition of near.  \n \nThe Hashiyat al-'Adawi notes that there is a second position \nabout \"near\" and that it is about a month.  \n \n35.2d The freeing of a mudabbar is from the disposable \nthird  \n \nWhen the master dies, the emancipation of the mudabbar \ncomes out of the disposable third, while a slave promised \nfreedom at a certain date comes from the total estate.  \n \nPriority in the disposable third of the estate is given to a slave \ngiven a tadbir when the deceased was healthy. Then comes the \nslave given a tadbir when he was ill. If someone has been set a \ndate at which he will be free, he is different to the mudabbar and \nis set free from the capital of the estate.  \n \n35.3 Kitaba: the agreement to free a slave on payment by \nagreed installments  \n \n35.3a. The kitaba agreement  \n \nA slave with a kitaba [mukatib] remains a slave as long as \nhe still owes anything. The kitaba agreement is permitted \nwhen made with the agreement of the slave and master for \nan amount to be paid in installments, however many or few \nthey are.  \n \nNo matter how little is outstanding of the payments, the mukatib \nis still a slave since it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"The mukatib remains a slave as long as a \nsingle dirham of his kitaba is outstanding.\"  \n \nKitaba is the emancipation of a slave in return for money paid in \ninstallments. There is no disagreement that it is permitted. The \nBook indicates its legality: \"If any slaves you own desire to make a \ncontract to free themselves, write it for them if you know of good in \nthem.\" (Holy Qur‟an 24:33) The precondition is that the payment \nbe done in installments. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nreported from the Mudawanna, \"It is not immediate and the \ninstallments are stipulated, like x amount every month or every \nyear based on their mutual agreement.\"  \n \nIn al-Jawahir Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Our scholars \nsay that an immediately paid kitaba is permitted. It is analogous \nto a sale in which both immediacy and deferral are accepted.\"  \n \n35.3b When the slave defaults  \n \nIf he is unable to pay, he reverts to a full slave and the \nmaster can keep what he has already received. The slave \ncan only be deemed insolvent by the sultan after failing to \npay if he refuses to acknowledge his insolvency.  \n \nNone of him is free. The master keeps what he paid because he is \nhis slave. If the slave acknowledges his inability to pay, he \nautomatically reverts to full slave status.  \n \n35.4 Children and the property of slaves  \n \n35.4a Status of the children of women slaves  \n \nIf a woman has a kitaba or tadbir agreement, or a date is \nset for her emancipation, or she is pledged as security, any \nchild she bears shares her status.  \n \nHer children have her status whether the child is conceived in \nmarriage or by fornication. If the father is the master, the child is \nfree without dispute if the master is free. If the father is a slave, it \nis slave like her in all her rulings of emancipation, work, sales and \nthe like.  \n \n35.4b Status of children of a umm walad by other than the \nmaster  \n \nThe children of an umm walad fathered by other than her \nmaster have the same status as her.  \n \nThis about any children she has after she becomes a umm walad. \nThere is no disagreement about that in the School. As for children \nshe had before she became umm walad, they remain slaves.  \n \n35.4c The possessions of slaves  \n \nA slave's property belongs to him his unless the master \nconfiscates it. If the master frees him or grants him a \nkitaba and does not exclude the slave's property, then he \ncannot confiscate it.  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it appears from \nwhat he says that he actually owns it, and so there are two \nsecondary rulings from his words. One is that he is permitted to \nhave intercourse with his slavegirl since he owns her. The second \nis that a slave is obliged to pay zakat on the property in his \npossession. The well-known position, however, is that a slave does \nnot pay zakat.  \n \nThe Hashiyya of al-'Adawi points that his ownership of \nproperty is not, in fact, complete.  \n \nIt is agreed about anything he earns property after the contract of \nkitaba. According to the School, it applies to what he earned \nbefore the contract.  \n \n35.4d A slavegirl with a kitaba  \n \nThe master cannot have intercourse with a slavegirl who \nhas a kitaba contract.  \n \nThat is because her person and property are protected. If he does \nhave intercourse with her, the hadd is not imposed on him in the \nwell-known position, He is punished unless he is excused due to \nignorance or error and he does not owe any bride-price. If she is a \nvirgin or he forces her, he owes the amount of her depreciation. It \nstates in al-Jawahir, \"If she becomes pregnant, she can choose \nbetween insolvency and become an umm walad or continue with \nthe rest of her kitaba. If she chooses insolvency, she becomes a \numm walad. If she chooses to pay the rest of her kitaba, she is the \nmother of a child and a mukatiba [which means that the master is \nresponsible for her maintenance while she is pregnant]. When she \npays the installments, she is free. Otherwise she is free when the \nmaster dies.  \n \n35.4e Children of a slave with a kitaba  \n \nAny children born to a man or woman slave with a kitaba \ncontract after they have concluded a kitaba have the \nstatus and they are free when the parents are free.  \n \n35.5 Freeing a group by kitaba  \n \nIt is permitted for a group to have a kitaba but they only \nfree when the entire sum is paid.  \n \nThis is a single contract when they belong to the same master. \nThey pay according to their ability to pay on the day of the \ncontract of the kitaba was made.  \n \n35.6 Restrictions on a mukatib  \n \nA slave with a kitaba cannot free his own slaves or waste \nhis property until he is free. He cannot marry nor \nundertake a long journey without his master's permission.  \n \nHe can not get rid of his property without recompense for it, as \nthrough gifts and sadaqa, if that considerable. The reason for that \nis that it would be injurious to his master and it might lead to his \ninability to pay. He cannot undertake a long journey in which his \ninstallments will become due before he returns. Shaikh al-Aqfashi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the permission of his master refers \nto both marriage and travel. He can do it with his master's \npermission.  \n \n35.7 Children of a deceased mukatib  \n \n35.7a The status of the children of a mukatib when he dies  \n \nIf the slave with a kitaba dies leaving a child, he takes his \nplace and pays from his estate whatever is still unpaid \nwhich becomes immediately due. His children inherit any \nremaining property.  \n \nHis children who are part of the contract take his place, but that \nis not paid in installments. It is due immediately and is paid from \nhis estate if he left enough to cover the installments or more, \nbecause his responsibility ends at death, like all deferred debts.  \n \n35.7b If there is not enough to cover it  \n \nIf there is not enough to settle the amount, the children \nshould trade with what there is and pay it off in \ninstallments if they are adults. If they are children, and the \nestate is not enough to cover the installments until they \ncome of age and can trade, they revert to being full slaves.  \n \nAdult children continue to pay the installments if they have the \nability to work and can be trusted with the money. Otherwise the \nmoney is put with a trustee who pays on their behalf. If they are \nminors and there is enough to cover the installments until they \ncome of age, they are not made full slaves, but the money is lodged \nwith a trustee who pays the master his installments.  \n \n35.7c If the mukatib has no children  \n \nIf he does not have any children in his kitaba, his master \ninherits from him.  \n \nAnd there is not enough to cover the debt, the master is the heir \nby virtue of him being a slave, not by the wala', since he dies a \nslave.  \n \n35.8 Umm Walads  \n \nA umm walad is a slavegirl who has borne her master a child.  \n \n35.8a When a man has a child by his slavegirl  \n \nIf a man has child by a slavegirl, he can enjoy her while he \nis alive and then she is set free from the main estate when \nhe dies.  \n \nHe is permitted to enjoy her by the words of Allah, \"Or those they \nown as slaves, in which case they are not blameworthy.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 23:6) The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) had such a \nrelationship with Maria the Copt. When the man dies, his umm \nwalad is set free first, without any requiring any legal ruling and \ncannot be enslaved on account of his debts, whether they existed \nbefore or after her pregnancy.  \n \n35.8b Her status  \n \nHe is not permitted to sell her or demand her work or \ndemand revenue from her. He may, however, demand that \nfrom her child by another man.  \n \nIf he does sell her, the sale is void, even if the buyer frees her or \ntakes her as a umm walad or she dies. The buyer is given the price \nback. The same applies to gifts, pledges and the like. He can not \noblige a lot of work from her, but can oblige minor work like \ngrinding flour and fetching water. He cannot make her work for \nsomeone else, but he can do that with her other children.  \n \n35.8c Her children's status  \n \nSuch a child has the same status as his mother regarding \nemancipation and is free when she is free.  \n \nThis refers to her children by other than the master. This is when \nthe master dies when she is alive. If she dies before him, her \nchildren are not free until the master dies.  \n \n35.8d Miscarriages  \n \nAny miscarriage known to be a child makes her an umm \nwalad.  \n \n No matter whether it is a lump or clot, and even clotted blood, \naccording to the well-known position.  \n \nThis has two preconditions. The first is that the master admits to \nhaving had intercourse with her, and the second is that, in the \nabsence of the child, two women testify to the birth or miscarriage.  \n \n35.8e Denial of paternity  \n \nHe cannot claim coitus interruptus in order to deny \npaternity of the child if he admits to having had \nintercourse with her. If he claims that he has observed \nistibra' and not had intercourse with her afterwards, the \npaternity of her child born after that is not attributed to \nhim.  \n \nCoitus interruptus is withdrawal before ejaculation. It does not \nremove the paternity because even a small amount of semen can \nresult in conception.  \nIf he has observed istibra', which is remaining apart from her for \nat least one menstrual period or more, then in the famous position \nthe child is not attributed to him. He is not obliged to take an oath \nin that [about having observed istibra'.]  \n \n35.9 Obstacle of a slave's debts  \n \nIt is not permitted for someone whose property is covered \nby debts to set a slave free.  \n \nFreeing slaves is one of the greatest devotional acts one can do to \ndraw near to Allah. It is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"If someone frees a believing slave, Allah \nazza wa jall will save a limb of his from the Fire for every limb of \nhis.\" In one version, \"a limb of his from the fire for every limb of \nhis, even his genitals for his genitals.\" Freeing a man is better.  \n \nEmancipation has three pillars.  \n \n1. The first is the person frees, who must be adult and sane \nwith no legal restrictions on his dealings and not having \ndebts that take up all his property, An emancipation done \nby a child, madman or one legal restricted from financial \ndealings is not permitted. Nor is it permitted if his debts \ncover all his property, whether those debts are immediate \nor deferred because then he would be disposing of \nsomeone else's property.  \n \n2. The second is the slave, who can be a full slave or one \nwith some degree of freedom, like a mudabbar.  \n \n \n3. The third is the form which indicates removal of ownership \nas, \"You are free.\"  \n \n35.10 Freeing part of a slave  \n \n35.10a Someone who frees part of a slave frees all of him  \n \nIf someone frees part of his slave, he is made to free all of \nhim.  \n \nAs when he frees a fourth, third or half. He is judged to have freed \nall of him not just part of him, when the slave set free is Muslim \nsane, sensible with no debts and when the slave has one master.   \n \n35.10b If there is more than one master  \n \nIf someone else has a share in the slave, the share of his \npartner is estimated on the day the emancipation is \nsettled, and the slave is free. If he does not have the money \nto pay the partner, the portion of the partner in the slave \nremains.  \n \nThe one who set free his part must pay the partner the price \nwhich is assessed on the day of the judgment of emancipation if \nthere is judgment in it. Then the emancipation depends on the \nruling issued for it, not by the simple freeing of part of the slave. If \nthe person is wealthy, he pays the share of the partner on the day \nof the judgment. If he is not wealthy on the day of the judgment, \nthen the slave remains a slave unless his remaining master frees \nhim. If he has enough to pay for part of the share of the partner, it \nis estimated according to what he has.  \n \n35.11 Freeing because of mutilation  \n \nIf someone mutilates his slave clearly, such as cutting off a \nlimb and the like, the slave is set free.  \n \nLike a foot, hand or like a testicle. Then the master is obliged to \nfree him, even if that was intended to increase the price since he \ntortured him by doing that. Similar to cutting off a limb is gouging \nout an eye or the branding his face or elsewhere with fire. He is \nfreed from his estate. It appears from his words that he is freed \nautomatically on account of the mutilation, and Ashhab says that. \nIbn al-Qasim says that he is only freed by a ruling.  \n \nShaikh al-'Adawi (rahmatullahi alaihi): There is disagreement \nabout whether the master is punished by beating and \nimprisonment or whether the punishment is the enforced \nemancipation of the slave.  \n \n35.12 Freeing because of kinship  \n \nIf someone obtains ownership of his parents, his children \nor grandchildren, grandfather or grandmother, or uterine, \npaternal or full brother, that slave is freed automatically.  \n \nThis applies to relationship by blood or by suckling. All he \nmentioned is automatic and does not require a ruling in the well-\nknown position provided that he does not have debts which would \ntake up the price. If he has debts which would take up the price, \nhe cannot free him by that and nor sell nor can remain the owner \nof such a relative. Rather he is sold for him to cover the debt.  \n \n35.13 Freeing which is a consequence  \n \nIf someone frees a pregnant woman, her unborn child is \nfree with her.  \n \nWhether the child is by marriage or fornication. The child is free \nbecause every child who comes by marriage or fornication without \nownership follows the mother in freedom or slavedom.  \n \n35.14 Freeing because of a legal obligation  \n \nIn freeing slave to discharge an obligation, one may not \nfree a slave who is the process of being freed, like one with \na tadbir or a kitaba or something similar, nor one who is \nblind, or has had a hand or the like amputated, or a non-\nMuslim, a child, or someone who is subject to enforced \nguardianship.  \n \nThis is on account of obligations like the kaffarah for killing [and \nthat for dhihar divorce or for breaking the fast of Ramadan].  \n \nCategories who cannot be freed for this also include an umm \nwalad, someone with a date at which they will be free or someone \nwho is partially free, because it is muddled with the contract of \nliberation. [Only full slaves fulfill the obligation.]  \n \nFurthermore in satisfying the obligation, one cannot free \namputees since that decreases the value of the slave by the defect. \nIt cannot be a non-Muslim because Allah azza wa jall says, \"a \nbelieving slave\". It cannot be a child because he is not one of the \npeople of responsibility. Nor can someone debarred from dealing \nwith his own finances, who is a fool who spends his money \nimproperly.  \n \n35.16 Wala' [Clientage] \n \nThis gives the one who has this has what is tantamount to an \nagnate relationship to the former slave, i.e. as if he were related to \nhim via the father.  \n \n35.16a The one who receives the wala'  \n \nThe wala' belongs to the one who sets a slave free. It is not \npermitted to sell it or give it away.  \n \nThe person who removes ownership by liberating a slave becomes \nhis mawla if the one who is freed the slave is a Muslim. If the one \nwho freed is an unbeliever and he frees a Muslim, he has no wala' \nrelationship to his freed Muslim. The wala' then goes to the \ncommunity of Muslims. If the person then becomes Muslim, the \nwala' does not revert to him. The basis for this principle is found \nin the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The \nwala' belongs to one who sets free.\" It cannot be disposed of \nbecause of what Shaikh ibn Hibban (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nothers related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"The wala' is flesh like the flesh of lineage. It is not sold or given \naway.\"  \n \n35.16b Freeing on behalf of someone  \n \nIf someone frees a slave on behalf of another man, that \nman still has the wala'.  \n \nIf the man who ordered the emancipation is free. If he is slave, \nthen his master has the wala'.  \n \n35.16c The one who receives a shahadah  \n \nIf someone becomes Muslim at someone's hand, the wala' \ndoes not go to him, but to the Muslims as a whole.  \n \nWhen an unbeliever says the shahadah with someone, that person \ndoes not receive the wala' of that person [because the wala' only \nbelongs to the person who emancipates.  \n \n35.16d Women receiving the wala'  \n \nWhen a woman sets a slave free, she has the wala' of that \nperson as well as the wala' of the person's children and \nany slaves that person frees. In the case of someone she \nhas not set free, she does not inherit the wala' from her \nfather, son, husband or anyone else.  \n \nShe has the wala' of their children and freed slaves because she is \nthe initial emancipator and that is attributed ultimately to her. \nThe wala' is inherited via the agnatic male line and not the \nfemale.  \n \n35.16e Inheritance of a slave with no wala'  \n \nThe estate left by a slave without a wali [sa'iba] goes to the \nMuslim community.  \n \nThis is the sa'iba. Such a status comes about when someone tells \nhis slave, \"You are free as a musib\" or \"sa'iba\", by which he means \nemancipated. This expression is disliked because it was used in \nthe Jahiliyya for livestock as Allah azza wa jall says about them, \n\"Allah did not institute any such thing as bahira or sa’iba\" (Holy \nQur‟an 5:105)  \n \n35.16f Inheritance of wala'  \n \nThe wala' is inherited by the closest agnatic heir of the \ndead person. If he has two sons, they share the wala' \nbetween them. If one of them dies, leaving sons, the wala' \ngoes to his brother rather than his sons. If one of them dies \nleaving one son, and the other dies leaving two sons, the \nwala' is shared between all three.  \n \nAlthough the term \"inheritance\" is used here, properly speaking \nthe wala' is not inherited, but there is inheritance on account of it. \nShaikh al-'Adawi (rahmatullahi alaihi): Wala', like lineage, is only \nestablished by two witnesses.  \n \n \n \nChapter 36: Property Rights \n \n \nPre-emption (shuf'a), gifts, sadaqa, hubus, pledges, the \n'ariyya, deposits, lost items, and misappropriation  \n \n \nThis chapter deals with nine topics.  \n \n36.1 Pre-emption in property (shuf'a)  \n \n36.1a The right of pre-emption  \n \nPre-emption is allowed in something which is jointly \nowned.  \n \nShuf'a is derived from shaf' [even], the opposite of odd, because \nthe pre-emptor [shafî'] adds the share which he takes to his share \nand so his share becomes two shares. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) defined it as the partner taking his share \nfrom his partner by an enforced purchase.  \n \nThen he moves to the relationship of the neighbor. Our position \nthat is he has no pre-emption. What is taken by force can be a \nvoluntary sale. It is an allowance which is allowed to avert harm \nto the partner. Jabir (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) judged that there was pre-emption in all \nundemarcated property. When there were clear boundaries and \nroads were clear, then there was no pre-emption.\" (al-Bukhari & \nothers) There are two rulings based on this hadith: the obligation \nof pre-emption is for the partner rather than the neighbor because \nthe ruling in the hadith is that there is no pre-emption after \ndemarcation, and so a neighbor cannot pre-empt his neighbor. The \nsecond is that the obligation concerns real estate rather than \ngoods.  \n \nHe indicates by mentioning joint ownership. He means that the \nright concerns land and buildings and trees attached to it. Shaikh \nal-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the wisdom in \naffirmation of pre-emption is the removal of harm to the partner \nand it is particular to real estate because harm occurs most \nfrequently in it. They agree that there is no pre-emption in \nanimals, clothes, utensils and all moveables. A precondition for \npre-emption is that it is something in which division is feasible, \nthus excluding things which do not accept it without being \nrendered unsound, like a bath-house.  \n \n36.1b When there is no right to pre-emption  \n \nThere is no pre-emption in what has been divided, nor is \nthere pre-emption in respect of a neighbor, a road, the \ncourtyard of a house whose rooms have been divided, a \nmale palm tree or a well when the palm trees or the land \nhas been divided. There is only pre-emption in land and \nthe buildings and trees on it.  \n \nPre-emption was prescribed either to avoid harm in the division or \nharm to a partner. That does not exist in demarcated property \nwhich is why there is no pre-emption in it. Three of the Imams \nagree that the neighbor has no pre-emption while Imam Abu \nHanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) disagrees and affirms pre-emption \nfor the neighbor, but in his view the partner takes precedence over \nthe neighbor. There is no pre-emption in a private road shared \nbetween partners in a house or a garden. As for public roads, it is \nnot permitted to sell them. As for a yard when the house is \ndivided, there is no pre-emption, but if the estate is not divided \nand then is sold and one of the partners has his share of the estate \nand the road, then there is agreement that there is pre-emption in \nboth the estate and the road.  \n \nThere is no pre-emption in a male palm or a well. If pre-emption \nhad been permitted in that, the partner would take all the male \npalm trees and the buyer would have none because pre-emption in \nthat in which the partners share is only the male palm. If land is \ndivided and the well remains, there is no pre-emption.  \n \nTo sum up, pre-emption applies to jointed owned property and the \nright is canceled in three ways.  \n \nOne is when it is abandoned by explicit words, as 'I give up my \npre-emption.\"  \n \nThe second is what indicates that it is abandoned like seeing the \nbuyer building and planting and still remaining silent. The third \nis indicated next.]  \n \n36.1c When pre-emption lapses  \n \nThere is no pre-emption for someone present after a year \nhas passed. If he was absent he still has his right, even if it \nhas been a long time.  \n \ni.e. present in the land where the sale occurs. If he is present for a \nyear and is silent about seeking pre-emption for two months, that \ncancels his right. The one who was absent and far away still has \nthe right since he was absent before the possibility of pre-emption \narose, whether or not he knew about the sale. There is no \ndefinition of near or far (because circumstances vary).  \n \n36.1d Forcing a decision  \n \nA buyer must guarantee the one with the right of pre-\nemption. A possible pre-emptor may be forced to exercise \nhis right or forgo it.  \n \nThe buyer is responsible for any damage to the property. Shaikh \nal-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if someone is entitled to \ntake it from the pre-emptor, he takes it without giving him \nanything and the pre-emptor must reimburse the buyer what he \npaid and the buyer returns the price to the seller. [This is when \nthere has been more than one transaction.]  \n \nThe buyer can summon the pre-emptor and demand that he \nabandon his right or pay the price for which he bought it if it has a \nlike or its equivalent if it was something with value [i.e. if was \npaid for in livestock or goods, for instance]. If he does one of the \ntwo, there is no discussion. Otherwise the case is presented to the \njudge. If he asks for delay so that he can choose or bring the price, \nhe is given a delay of three days.  \n \n36.1e Pre-emption cannot be transferred  \n \nPre-emption may not be given away or sold. The right is \ndivided between partners according to their shares.  \n \nIt is not permitted for the pre-emptor to give or sell his right of \npre-emption. That form of that would be that Zayd who can pre-\nempt says to 'Amr, who has no right, \"I have given you my right to \npre-empt with Khalid,\" or \"Buy it from me for such-and-such.\" \nPre-emption is a right granted to a partner for the sake of \nremoving harm from him by entering into a partnership with \nsomeone he does not know.  \n \n36.2 Gifts [hiba], sadaqa, and hubus [waqf]  \n \n36.2a Gifts and sadaqa  \n \nGifts and sadaqa only differ in two things. One is that gifts can be \ntaken back while sadaqa is not taken back. When a father gives \nhis son something, he can take it back from him, but that is not \nthe case if he gives him sadaqa.  \n \nThe second difference is that it is permitted for a gift can revert to \nthe ownership of the giver by a sale, gift, sadaqa or some other \nmethod. That is not the case with sadaqa. It is disliked for it to \nrevert to the ownership of the giver by the means we mentioned \nabout the gift.  \n \nIts status is that it is recommended as indicated by the Book, \nSunnah and consensus. In the Book, Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Allah commands to justice and doing good,\" (Holy Qur‟an 16:90) \nand \"Who, despite their love for it, give away their wealth.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 2:176) In the hadith, \"If anyone gives in sadaqa as much as \na date from honest earnings - and Allah azza wa jall only accepts \nwhat is good - Allah azza wa jall will accept it in His right hand \nand will then increase it in size for the giver, just like one of you \nmight rear a foal, until it is the size of a mountain.\" Shaikh ibn \nRushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others related that consensus on \nit.  \nHashiyat al-'Adawi: There are four essential elements [arkan] \nin gifts.  \n1. The giver, who must not be someone legally debarred from \ndealing with financial matters.  \n \n2. A gift given by such a person is not valid  \n \n3. The recipient, who must be someone who can own something.  \n \n4. The gift, which must be something whose ownership can be \ntransferred.  \n \n5.The form of the giving.  \n \n36.2b It is dependent on possession  \n \nA gift, sadaqa or hubus is only complete by actual \npossession of it. If the giver dies before it is collected, then \nit becomes part of inheritance, unless that gift was made \nduring his final illness. Then it is paid out of the disposable \nthird as long as it is for other than an heir.  \n \nIf the giver dies before the gift is taken, it reverts to the estate and \nis inherited and the gift is void. If he makes the gift in his final \nillness, however, it is paid out as a bequest unless it is for a heir \nbecause it is not lawful to make a bequest to an heir and so it is \nvoid. But if the other heirs allow it, it is carried out.  \n \n36.3 Gifts and sadaqa  \n \n36.3a Gifts to close relatives  \n \nA gift to a close relative or poor person is like sadaqa and \ncannot be taken back.  \n \nA close relative is one with whom marriage is not permitted and \nsuch a gift is for the purposes of maintaining ties of kinship. The \nprohibition against taking back gifts or sadaqa to a poor person is \nbecause they were given away for the reward and seeking the face \nof Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n36.3b Gifts to one's son  \n \nWhen someone gives sadaqa to his son, he cannot take it \nback. He may, however, take back something he gave to a \nminor child or adult as long as he has not used it to get \nmarried or given it as a loan and nothing has happened to \nthe gift.  \n \nIf the gift was not for the sake of ties of kinship or his poverty or \nout of the desire for the reward of the Next World, but was for \nhimself. There is no difference between a male or female child, \nrich or poor. Something happening to a gift would be like if he was \ngiven iron and has made it made into a tool.  \n \n36.3c A mother's gifts  \n \nA mother may take back a gift as long as the father is alive. \nWhen the father is dead, she cannot take it back.  \n \nWhether the child is a minor or adult as long as the father is alive, \neven if he was mad at the time of the gift, unless, by the gift, she \nintended to maintain ties of kinship, or the reward of the Next \nWorld or because of his poverty. Then she cannot take it back.] \n \n36.3d. Gifts to orphans  \n \nOne may not take back a gift to an orphan. An orphan is \nsomeone who has lost his father.  \n \nIf he has no father at the time of the gift, she cannot take it back \nbecause he is an orphan and thus it becomes like sadaqa. No \nmatter what the age a person is, if his father is dead, he is called \nan orphan in the case of humans. In the case of animals, lack of \nmother makes an orphan, and in the case of birds, both parents.  \n \n36.3e Retaining possession of the gift  \n \nA father is permitted to retain possession what he gives to \nhis minor son when he does not live in that (if it is a house) \nor wear it if it is garment. He can only do that if the gift is \na specific article. He cannot do that if the son is an adult.  \n \nThis is permitted even until he is bankrupt or dies. If the gift is a \nhouse and he continues to live in it or most of it or to wear a \ngarment he gave him until there is an impediment, the gift is \nnullified. If he lives in a small part and rents most of it out, it is \nnot nullified. This is when the gift is described and specified, like \na particular house. He cannot say, \"I have given you one of the \nhouses.\" The father cannot keep that gift if the child is adult and \nsensible. If the son is a fool, he can keep possession of it.  \n \n36.3f Not taking back sadaqa  \n \nA man should not take back his sadaqa or nor can he \nrecover it except by inheritance. There is no harm in \ndrinking the milk of an animal he gave as sadaqa. He does \nnot buy back anything he gave away as sadaqa.  \n \nHe does not take back sadaqa at all once it is received, either by \nbuying it or any other method, and here is no exception to that \nexcept by inheritance, and then he owns it because he had no part \nin returning it and is not suspect. He can drink the milk of \nsomething like a cow or goat and there is nothing wrong in that \nbecause he has not altered the value of he gift. He does not buy \nback his sadaqa from the person he gave it to nor from anyone \nelse. This prohibition is one of dislike, which is the School.  \n \n36.3g Gifts with expectation of a recompense  \n \nIf someone is given a gift for which the giver expects \nrecompense, he should either repay it with something of \nequal value or return the gift. If he no longer has it, then \nhe must give back its value when he sees that the giver \nwanted recompense for what he gave him.  \n \nThis is when the man gives something of his property to another \nso that he will reward him for it. It is a contract of recompense for \nunknown goods. It is permitted. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"The gift for a recompense is not an act of nearness, \nbut it is a sort of mutual recompense. The one given either \nrecompenses the value of the gift or returns it if the gift is still \navailable. If it is no longer with him, he repays the price or the gift \nif he thinks that the giver wanted that according to the \ncircumstances.  \n \n36.3h Not giving all one's property to one child  \n \nIt is disliked for someone to give all his property to one of \nhis children. Giving part of his property is allowed. There \nis nothing wrong in giving all his property to the poor for \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \nThis is a dislike of one of avoidance in the well-known position. He \nshould not give most of it to one of them either, but what he does \nis carried out unless his other children rise and forbid him to do \nthat. They can force its return [when they fear that they will have \nto support him]. The basis is the hadith of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) \"Fear Allah and be equitable to your \nchildren.\" A small amount is permitted.  \nHe can give all his property to the poor as long as his children do \nnot forbid it. That is limited to when he is not ill. If he is ill, he can \nonly dispose of a third.  \n \n36.3i If the gift has not been collected  \n \nIf someone who is given something does not take \npossession of it until the donor is ill or bankrupt, he \ncannot then take it. If the recipient dies, his heirs can take \nit if the giver is still in good health.  \n \nAn illness here is one in which it is feared that he may die. As well \nas applying to gifts, this principle also applies to sadaqa and \nhubus.  \n \n36.4 Hubus [waqf]  \n \nA hubus is granting the usufruct of something, either in \nperpetuity or for a specific period after which it then reverts to \nprivate property.  \n \nThe Four Imams allow it but disagree about whether it requires \nthe ruling of a judge or is carried out in the same manner as \nbequests. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), Imam ash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) say \nthat it is sound without these two methods and is binding, Imam \nAbu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it requires one of these \ntwo.  \n \nIt is recommended because it is one of the best things which one \ncan use to draw near to Allah azza wa jall. The basis for its \npermissibility is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \ncreated a hubus as did 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \n'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu), 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu anhu), Talha \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu)  and az-Zubayr (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  and \nother Companions for houses and gardens.  \n \nThere are four basic elements (arkan) in the hubus.  \n \n1.  The founder and his suitability for establish a waqf.  \n \n2.  The verbal form of founding the waqf, or whatever the custom \nfor that is. \n \n3.  The object or place which comprises the waqf. \n \n4. The purpose or beneficiaries of the waqf.  \n \n36.4a A house in hubus  \n \nWhen someone makes a house a hubus, it is used for the \npurpose to which he put it if it taken before he dies.  \n \nThe precondition is that the endower is entitled to dispose of his \nproperty of disposable by being one of the people who can dispose \nof his property and make gifts. He can make a waqf of a house, an \nanimal and goods. [In the case of food, it has to be something \nwhich lasts for a long time, like wheat.] The precondition is that it \nis owned by the person who endows it, in itself or its use, and no \none has a claim connected to it, and it is not something which it is \nnot permitted to sell, like the skin of sacrifices and hunting dogs. \nIt is used for the specific purpose for which it was endowed.  \n[Hashiyya: A waqf in money is questionable. There is a position \nthat it is permitted because it lasts and can be replaced. The other \nposition is that it is not permitted because its use lies in its \nconsumption and a waqf must consist of something which will \ncontinue to exist. Lack of permission here can mean dislike or \nprohibition.]  \n \nIf he designates a house as a waqf but does not specify the reason, \nit is used according to the common usage‟s of the people of that \nland.  \n \nIf its use is specified and taken, it is put to that use. If it is not \ntaken before he dies or becomes bankrupt, the waqf is nullified. If \nit is not specific, like a mosque, it does not require a specific \ntaking possession. When people are allowed to do the prayer, then \nwaqf is valid.  \n \n36.4b Waqf for a minor son  \n \nIf it is a hubus in favor of his minor son, he may hold it for \nhim until he comes of age. He should rent it out for him \nand not live it in himself. If he continues to live in it until \nhe dies, then the hubus is nullified.  \n \nThe end of possession is when the child comes of age provided that \nhe knows that he is sensible. If the father continues to live in it \nuntil he dies or becomes bankrupt, then the waqf is nullified. This \nis when the son is free, not a slave.  \n \n36.4c When the original beneficiaries die out  \n \nIf the beneficiaries of the hubus come to an end, the \nnearest of people to the founder on the day it reverts \nbecomes the beneficiary.  \n \nThis is whether the founder is dead or alive. This is like when the \nfounder has a full brother and a half brother by the father. The \nfull brother dies, leaving a son and then the beneficiaries of the \nwaqf come to an end. It reverts to the half brother rather than the \nson of the full brother. One considers who is the closest on the day \nit reverts, not he day it was founded because it may be that the \nrelative who was distant on the day it was endowed will become \nnear when the waqf reverts.  \n \n36.5 Life Grants ['umra]  \n \n36.5a Granting use for a person's lifetime  \n \nIf someone gives a man the use of a house for his lifetime, \nit reverts to the owner when the person dies. It is the same \nif he gave the use to the children of the person and they die \nout. This is not the case with the hubus.  \n \nIf the owner has died, it reverts to his heirs. The reality of 'umra \nin custom is that people of Shari‟ah define it as the gift of the \nusufruct of a certain property for the lifetime of the donee or for \nhis lifetime and that of his descendants, not the gift of a ruqba \n(which is the property for his lifetime). It does not have to be \nspecific for the life of the donee. If it is limited to the life of the \ndonee, it is also called 'umra. This differs from the hubus which \ndoes not revert to the ownership of the owner when the \nbeneficiaries die. A hubus remains a waqf for the closest relative \nof the beneficiaries. There is a difference because the waqf is \nownership of the property and the 'umra is ownership of the use.  \n \n36.5b Death of donee and granter at the same time  \n \nIf the one who granted the use dies on the same day, the \nproperty goes to his heirs on the day he dies.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that it is possible \nthat it means the day of making the 'umra, and then it is the \nownership of the property rather than the usufruct. It can refer to \nthe death of the giver and then it is ownership of property and \nusufruct.  \n \n36.6 More on hubus  \n \n36.6a Death of a beneficiary  \n \nIf one of the people of the hubus dies, his share goes to the \nrest.  \n \nMale or female or equal in this.  \n \n36.6b Those in need are preferred  \n \nPeople in need of lodging and revenue are preferred for \nthe hubus.  \n \nThis is when the beneficiary is not specified, like saying that it is \nfor the poor. Then the people of need and dependents are preferred \nto others for lodging and revenue according to ijtihad because that \nis the aim of the waqfs. If the beneficiaries are specified, then they \nare all equal, and the poor is not preferred to the wealthy.  \n \nThere is some disagreement in the School about whether the poor \nare preferred or not.  \n \n36.6c Evictions  \n \nIf someone is resident, he should not be evicted for \nsomeone else unless that is a precondition in the hubus \nwhich is carried out.  \n \nEven if the new person does not have a dwelling nor revenue, and \neven if the current tenant has become rich after he started to live \nthere because the important thing is the need at the beginning, \nnot one that is constant. There is no security that it will not come \nback. If other than the most needy came first and lived there and \nthen he is evicted, then they will then be of equal need. So \nwhoever lived there first is more entitled to stay. If, however, it is \na term stipulated in the waqf, it is carried out.  \n \n36.6d A waqf is not sold  \n \nThe hubus is never sold, even if it falls into ruins. If a horse \nwhich is a hubus becomes rabid, it is sold and the price \nused for another one like it or to help in paying for one. \nThere is disagreement about replacing a ruined building \nwith a building not ruined.  \n \nWhen it becomes unusable, even if is not hoped to restore it. It is \nnot permitted to sell its rubble. This is restricted to when the \nfounder has not put a stipulation that it be sold. If he did so, than \nhis stipulations are followed.  \n \n[There is a counter position which states that if leaving it will \nresult in harm and there is no hope of restoring it, then it can be \nsold.]  \n \nThere is an exception mentioned in the Mukhtasar about the \namount which is needed to expand the mosque, i.e. the Jumu'a \nmosque, not any other mosque. Similar to the Jumu'a mosque are \nMuslim graveyards and roads because the use of the mosque, road \nand graveyard is greater than the use of the waqf. It is close to the \naim of the founder. There is disagreement about exchanging for a \nprice.  \n \nIn the case of a horse, rabies is a form of madness which can infect \na horse. If it is sold, then the price is used to buy another horse or \ngiven as sadaqa for jihad.  \n \nThere is disagreement replacing a ruined building. Some of them \ntake this literally as exchanging ruined property for unruined and \ngiving it for the unruined. Others say that the ruined property is \nsold and the price used to purchase what is sound and so what \nwas waqf ceases to be waqf and what was not waqf becomes waqf.   \n \n36.7 Pledges [rahn]  \n \n36.7a Legal status of pledges  \n \nThe use of a pledge is permitted and it is only \naccomplished by possession of the article pledged.  \n \nPledges are permitted at home or on a journey. The journey is \nspecified in the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"If you are on a \njourney and cannot find a writer, something can be left as a \nsecurity\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:282) since that is when it is more common \none cannot find a scribe to provide evidence. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) pledged his armor when he was in Madina. \nThat indicates its permissibility while one is resident.  \n \nIt would appear from what he says is that a pledge is valid before \nit is actually taken, and that is true, but it is only by actual \npossession that the pledgee has a special right to it rather than \nother creditors. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat if that is delayed until the bankruptcy or death of the \npledger, it is agreed to be nullified.  \n \n36.7b Witnessing pledges  \n \nTestimony about possession is only useful if the witness \nactually saw possession take place.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that this is when it \nis a distinct item and is handed over so that there is a transfer. \nWhen the pledge is not a distinct item and is not handed over, \ntestimony is useful is they both confirm it [e.g. it might consist of \ncertain palm trees].  \n \n36.7c Responsibility for the pledge  \n \nResponsibility for the pledge is that of the one who takes it \nif it is something which can be hidden. If it is something \nwhich cannot be hidden, he is not liable. The responsibility \nfor the fruit of palm trees in pledge is that of the pledger. \nThe same is true for the revenue of houses.  \n \nThis is when he takes the pledge if it is not lodged with a trustee \nwho takes it from the pledger. He is responsible for something \nwhich can be hidden, like jewelry, unless there is evidence that it \nhas been destroyed, Then he is not liable. He is not liable for \nthings like houses and gardens according to the well-known \nposition. This is the case even if the pledgee were to stipulate that \nhe is not liable for what can be concealed or the pledger were to \nstipulate that the pledgee is responsible for what is not hidden.  \n \n[Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nprecondition is void because it is contrary to what is entailed by \nthe contract. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nprecondition is binding.]  \n \nSomeone who is suspect swears, \"It is lost and I was not negligent \nnor destroy it. I did not misuse and I do not know where it is.\" The \none who is not suspected only swears to lack of neglect in \nparticular because it is not suspected that he has concealed it.  \n \nResponsibility for fruits is that of the pledger, whether the fruits \nexist or not at the time of the pledge and whether they are \npollinated or not, unless the pledgee stipulates that it included. \nThe same applies to revenue of houses. That is the responsibility \nof the pledger in the well-known position unless the pledgee \nstipulates that he has that.  \n \n36.7d Children of a slavegirl in pledge  \n \nIf a slavegirl bears a child while she is acting as a pledge, \nher child is also a pledge. The possessions of a slave do not \ngo into pledge with him unless that is stipulated.  \n \nIf he stipulates that the child is not part of the pledge, that is not \npermitted and the pledge is invalid.  \n \nIn the case of the possessions of a slave, whether they are known \nor unknown.  \n \n36.7e Responsibility for the pledge if destroyed  \n \nIf the pledge is destroyed in the possession of a trustee, it \nis the responsibility of the pledger.  \n \nIf it can be hidden. It is not the liability of the trustee because \nthere is no liability for the trustee.  \n \n36.8 The 'Ariyya [Loan for temporary use]  \n \nThe 'ariyya is assigned for a time. The borrower is \nresponsible for what is can be hidden, but not for what \ncannot be hidden, like a slave or a riding animal, unless he \nmisuses it.  \n \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) defines it as transfer of \nownership \nof \nthe \nusufruct \nof \na \nspecific \nthing \nwithout \ncompensation. It is recommended, and even more so in the case of \nrelatives, neighbors and friends. Its basis in the Book is the words \nof Allah azza wa jall, \"Do good, so that perhaps you may be \nsuccessful\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:75) and in hadith, the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) borrowed some armor from Safwan* and \nhe asked, \"Is it misappropriation, Muhammad?\" He (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Rather it is a guaranteed 'ariyya.\"  \n \nHe explains the question of liability in the 'ariyya. The borrower is \nliable for something which can be hidden unless there is evidence \nof its destruction. Then, in the well-known position, he is not \nliable because liability is based on suspicion which is removed by \nevidence. In the case of things which cannot be hidden, Abdullah \nibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) says that he must take an oath, \nwhether he is suspect or not. If the lender stipulates the \nborrower's liability, that is of no use. It is the same if the borrower \nstipulates to the lender lack of liability in that for which there is \nliability. That is of no use and he is liable according to one of the \npositions of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi). They also say that it is effective and \none acts by the preconditions because the 'ariyya is a known topic, \ni.e. there is no liability in the known.  \n \nThe exception to lack of liability is when the borrower abuses it \nand then he is liable. There are many types of abuse, including \nincreasing the load and increasing the distance. He is also liable \nin another case, which is when it is clear that he is lies as when he \nsays that it was destroyed in a certain place and none of his \ncompanions heard that it was destroyed.]  \n \n[*Safwan ibn Umayya who was still an unbeliever at that time.]  \n \n36.9 Deposits [wadi'a]  \n \nDeposit [wadi'a] comes from wada'a, which is \"to leave\". Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"Your Lord has not abandoned you nor does He \nhate you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 93:3) i.e. not abandoned His custom of \nbeing good in revelation to you. In technical usage it is property \nwhich is entrusted to someone's keeping and which must be \nreturned whenever the owner asks for it without excuse. He is \nbelieved about returning it to the depositor unless there was \nevidence in that and then he is only free by clear proof of that.  \n \n36.9a Statements about the deposit  \n \nIf someone given a deposit says, \"I have returned the \ndeposit to you,\" he is believed unless he received it in the \npresence of witnesses. If he says, \"It has disappeared,\" he is \nbelieved in any case. In the case of an 'ariyya, however, he \nis not believed about its destruction if it is something \nwhich can be concealed.  \n \nIf there were witnesses to his taking it, he is only believed when \nthere are witnesses to its collection as his trust was not enough. \nEvidence must be intended for ensuring security. Witnessing is \nonly considered when he says someone along the lines of \"Bear \nwitness that I have deposited such-and-such with him.\" It appears \nfrom his words, \"He is believed\" that he does not have to take an \noath. They derive from the Mudawwana that he must take an \noath.  \n \nWhen he says that the item is destroyed, he is believed whether \nthere was testimony or not. The one under suspicion rather than \nothers swears an oath in the well-known position. It is said that \nboth the one who is suspect and others swear.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated that and Shaikh \nat-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it. He repeats the point about \nthe 'ariyya to differentiate it from the deposit.  \n \n36.9b Abuse of a deposit  \n \nIf someone abuses a deposit, he is liable for it. If it was \ndinars, which he returns to their original bag and then \nthey are lost, there is disagreement about whether he is \nliable for them.  \n \nThere are many things that comprise abuse, including putting it \nwith someone else without an excuse, while on a journey or \nresident. Another is traveling with it without excuse and using it \nso that it is destroyed. He indicates this here.  \n \nIf it is dinars or dirhams which were tied or sealed and he lends \nthem or part of them and then returns the same amount to the \nbag and then they are destroyed, it is said that he is liable because \nhe misused by opening them. It is said that he is not liable. That \nis the position of Shaikh ibn a-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nothers. It is well known. It states in at-Tawdih, \"He owes it and it \nonly believed with an oath.\"  \n \n36.9c Trading with a deposit  \n \nIt is disliked for someone to trade with something \ndeposited with him. If he does so with money, the profit is \nhis. If the deposit was goods and he sells them, the owner \ncan choose between taking the price or the value on the \nday he infringed.  \n \nHe has any profit or any loss because he is responsible. It is \ndisliked to do so, even if it is the deposit is money. Shaikh al-\nAqfashi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. If the goods no longer \nexist, the owner has a choice between taking the price for which \nthey were sold or their value on the day he sold them. If they are \nstill present, he can choose between canceling the sale and taking \nback his goods, or taking the price for which they were sold.  \n \n36.10 Found property  \n \n36.10a Announcing the article which has been found  \n \nIf someone finds something, he must announce it for a year \nin a place where it is hoped that it will be recognized. If, \nafter a year, no one comes forward, he can make it a hubus \nor give it away as sadaqa. If he does that, he is responsible \nfor it if its owner should then come forward.  \n \nIt is mandatory to announce it immediately. If he delays until it is \nlost and then its master comes, he is liable for it. Shaikh at-Tata'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. It is mandatory to describe it since \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) commanded that. In the \nMuwatta' it states that a man came to the Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) and asked him about an item which is found. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Publicize its purse and its strap. Then \npublicize it for a year.\" Publicizing it for a year is applies if the \nitem is large. As for something insignificant to which one pays no \nattention, which is less than the legal dirham, as Shaikh Abu'l-\nHasan \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nthe \ncommentator \nof \nthe \nMudawwana, said, it is not publicized. What is more insignificant \nand less than a lot is publicized for some days if someone might \nlook for it. As for what will go bad by delay, like fruit, it is for the \nfinder and he does not announce it.  \n \nThe announcement is made in a place where that will achieve a \nresult, and it is in the place in which he found it. When he \nannounces it, he does not mention its category, but mentions it in \na general manner, saying, \"Who has lost something?\"  \n \nIf he then gives it away as sadaqa, it is on his behalf or on behalf \nof its owner.  \n \n36.10b Using the article  \n \nIf the finder makes use of it, he is responsible for it. If it is \ndestroyed before or after the year is up without action on \nhis part, he is not responsible.  \n \n He is responsible if it is destroyed. If he does not destroy it, he \nmust pay its rent to its owner if it is like something which is \nrented, like animals. If he did not do anything to abuse it, even \npermitted action, as when it is fodder, he is not liable because it is \na trust with him.  \n \n36.10c Claiming the article  \n \nIf the claimant recognizes the purse and the strap, he may \ntake it.  \n \nIt would appear that both matters must exist. That is not the case, \nbecause one of them is enough because he may have forgotten the \nother. It also appears that knowing the number of dinars and \ndirhams is not a precondition, and that is true according to Shaikh \nAsbagh (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) consider that. \nRevenue from the item during the period of publicizing it belongs \nto the finder. [Revenue can be milk, butter, cheese and the like.]  \n \n36.10d Lost animals  \n \nA man may not claim a stray camel in the desert, but he \ncan take a sheep and eat it if it is found in uninhabited \nwasteland.  \n \n[Hashiyyat: This is when the camel is safe from wild animals and \nthieves. Then he can take, although it is also stated that he does \nnot take it in any case.]  \n \nHorses and donkeys are not the same category as lost camels: they \nare part of lost articles. If he finds them, he takes them. An \nuninhabited area is like a desert.  \n \nHe is not liable or eating a sheep in the desert or uninhabited \narea, but if he brings to an inhabited area alive, he must announce \nit because then it becomes like a found article. \n \n36.11 Compensation for consumption of another's property  \n \nIf someone consumes merchandise, then he owes their \nvalue. If the goods are weighed or measured, he owes the \nequivalent.  \n \nThis is the well-known position. Opposite it is what Shaikh al-Baji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that he has a position which states that all damages are \nreplaced with their equivalent, as is stated by Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nAccording to the well-known position, one considers the price and \nthe place of the consumption, whether intentional or accidental. \nIntentional and accidental are the same in respect to people's \nproperty.  \n \nIf it is weighed, measured or counted things which are not \ndifferentiated, like eggs, he owes the equivalent in the place where \nhe consumed it. \n  \n[If the amount is undetermined, he is liable for the value of a heap \nof it.]  \n \n36.12 Misappropriation [ghasb]  \n \nThis is the final topic of this chapter. Ghasb in technical terms is \nto take property by force by encroachment without banditry. Its is \nforbidden because of what has come about in the ayats of the Holy \nQur'an and the hadiths of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). Among the ayats is, \"Allah does not love those who go \nbeyond the limits.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:190) There is the hadith in the \ntwo Sahih collections where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"No one unjustly takes a piece of land measuring a \nhand's width but that Allah azza wa jall will encircle him down to \nseven earth‟s on the Day of Rising.\"  \n \nOne of its rulings is liability as he indicates here.  \n \n36.12a A misappropriater is liable  \n \nA misappropriater is liable for what he misappropriated. If \nhe returns it in its original state, he owes nothing. If it has \nchanged while in his possession then the owner can choose \nbetween taking it with the defect or making him liable for \nits price.  \n \nShaikh \nal-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nsaid, \n\"The \nterm \nmisappropriater applies to every human who is Muslim or a \ndhimmi since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said 'The \nhand owes what takes until it returns it,' i.e. obliged to return it if \nit exists, or its price or equivalent if it is gone.\"  \n \nThe well-known position is that liability takes note of the state of \nthe misappropriation. If it is returned unchanged, he owes \nnothing. He is obliged discipline, repentance and asking \nforgiveness for the wrong action. If it is changed in a negative way \nby something divine, the owner can take it as it is with its defect \nwithout a fine or be paid the price on the day he took it.  \n \n36.12b When he has caused the damage  \n \nIf the loss was due to his misuse, the owner has a choice \nbetween taking it and taking it with compensation for the \ndamage. There is a difference of opinion about that.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Or he is liable for \nthe price on the day he misused it. It is reported from Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) and one position of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he can take the price or take it \nimperfect with nothing with it. This is the source of the \ndisagreement.  \n \n36.12c Income from usurped property  \n \nThe misappropriater has no right to the revenue and must \nreturn what he consumed of the revenue or pay for any use \nhe had from what he took. If he has intercourse with a \nslavegirl he takes, then he is subject to the hadd-\npunishment and his child is a slave of her owner.  \n \nIt is clear that it is mandatory to return the revenue absolutely, \nwhether land, animals, slaves or other things, and that is the \nposition of Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn \nZiyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \nliteral text of the book specifies responsibility for the revenue of \nland rather than slaves and animals, and that is the position of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) in the Mudawwana.  \n \nIf he has intercourse with a slavegirl he has wrongly taken, he is \nsubject to the hadd if fornication is established by evidence or \nconfession because it was unlawful intercourse with no quasi-legal \njustification. The child belongs to the owner because every child, \nfrom fornication or marriage, follows its mother in respect of \nownership.  \n \n36.12d Past revenue  \n \nThe usurper of property has no right to its profit up until \nthe time he returns it to the owner. Some of the people of \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefer that he give it \naway as sadaqa. There is something about this in the \nchapter on judgments.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that when he \nmisappropriates some money and trades with it and it increases in \nhis possession and it is connected to his responsibility, the profit is \nhis as the liability is his, but it is disliked since it comes from \nproperty to whose use the owner did not consent. When he returns \nthe capital as it was and is allowed it by the owner, that is \npermitted for him when the owner is agreeable about it. Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) recommended that he give it as \nsadaqa to expiate what he committed of the wrong action of \nmisappropriation based on what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Sadaqa extinguishes errors as water extinguishes \nfire.\"  \n \nThere is something about misappropriation in the next chapter on \njudgments. \n  \n \n \nChapter 37. Judgments on Homicide and \nHadd-Punishments \n \n \n \nThis chapter deals with reprisal (qawd), blood money, retaliation \n(qisas) and related topics, like the ghurra [slave paid in \ncompensation].  \n \n[Hashiyya: Qisas concerns retaliation for limbs and qawd is \nretaliation for loss of life.]  \n \nThis chapter also deals with the crimes which result in the hadd \npunishments, like illicit sex, slander, drinking, and theft. Hadd \nmeans prohibition, and legally is what is imposed to prevent the \ncriminal from reverting to the like of he did and to deter others.  \n \n[Hashiyya: The chapter also deals with its legal consequences, \nlike exile, and its size. Ta'zir (discretionary punishment) is also \ndealt with. The hudud are deterrents to protect loss of sanity, life, \nreligion, honor and property, and lineage. Qisas [retaliation] \nprotects lives. Amputation for theft protects property. The hadd \nfor illicit sex protects lineage. The hadd for drinking protects \nminds. The hadd for slander protects honor. Execution for \napostasy protects religion. It is said that the hudud are \nexpiation‟s, which is sound.]  \n \n \nRETALIATION FOR HOMICIDE  \n \n37.1Conviction for homicide  \n \n37.1a. Necessary evidence  \n \nNo one may be killed for homicide except on the basis of \njust evidence, confession, or by the qasama when that is \nnecessary.  \n \nA life is only taken for another life equal in freedom, Islam and \nprotection when the killing has been proven by one of three \nmatters. The first is evidence, the second confession and the third \nis the qasama oath. There are certain preconditions in the killing \nwhich will be dealt with.  \n \nHashiyya: A consequence of equality is that a free man is not \nkilled for a slave nor a Muslim for a non-Muslim because the \nhigher is not killed for the lower. As for protection, a harbi is not \nentitled to retaliation since he is not safe from being killed. This, \nof course, is as long as the person is not killed for financial gain. \nIn such a case, the higher is killed for the lower. The criminal in \nthis case must be one with legal responsibility [adult, sane], \nintend the blow, and the victim must have protection, either by \nIslam, safe conduct, or jizya. Retaliation is not carried out on a \nchild or mad person or someone who errs nor someone who kills \nsomeone with no protection.  \n \nFor evidence, the minimum is two men. Homicide which obliges \nretaliation is not established by one man and two women. The \nright to blood money, however, is established by that. In al-\nJawahir, it states that the precondition for the validity of the \ntestimony is agreement about the description of the killing. If the \ntwo witnesses differ in their description, as when one says that he \nslaughtered him and the other that he burned or wounded him, \nand the accused denied what they say and the relatives claim \nboth, there is no entitlement to his life. If they swear the qasama \nto one version, the testimony of one is canceled since the accused \nand the relatives agree that it was untrue. Confession is when the \naccused make a voluntary confession without being forced to do so. \n  \nThe qasama can be obliged when the killer in sane, adult and \nequal to the victim in respect of deen and freedom and is not his \nfather, and the relatives agree on killing. The oath is taken by two \nor more. Furthermore, there is suspicion, i.e. circumstances which \nstrengthen the claimant's side and it is probable that he is telling \nthe truth, as when a reputable person sees the victim in his blood \nand the accused to close to him with the trace of killing on him, as \nhe is stained in his blood and the knife in his hand.  \n \n37.1b Form of the qasama  \n \nThe form that the qasama takes is that the relatives [of the \nvictim] swear fifty oaths and then they are entitled to take \nthe life of the accused. If it was premeditated murder, then \nthe minimum required is that two men swear the oaths. \nMore than one man is not put to death as a result of the \nqasama.  \n \nThe relatives, who must be 'asaba [paternal relatives] of the \nvictim, whether they are his heirs or not, swear the oaths. If there \nare fifty of them, they each swear one oath: \"By Allah. There is no \ngod but Him. So-and-so killed him or he died from the blow he \nstruck.\" According to the Muwatta', then they are entitled to the \nlife of the accused. In premeditated murder, not less than two men \nof the 'asaba must swear in case of inadequate evidence, and that \ntakes the place of evidence. As the testimony of one man is not \nenough for evidence, it the same applies here. One is not enough.  \n \n[Hashiyya: If there are no 'asaba by lineage, then the 'asaba by \nclientage swear. The qasama obliges retaliation if it was \ndeliberate and blood money if it was accidental. The oaths are \nsworn one after another and then they are entitled to his life. The \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Will you swear fifty oaths so \nthat you will be entitled to the blood of your companion?\"]  \n \nIf a group are accused of homicide, and there is a qasama, it is \nsaid that the qasama is against one man, and it is said that it is \nagainst the entire group and then they choose one of them to \nexecute.  \n \n[Hashiyya: When a group deliberately kills someone acting \ntogether out of aggression and he dies immediately or is mortally \nwounded, and the actions of each of the group cannot be \ndistinguished and it is unclear which was the mortal injury or all \nthe injuries led to death, then they are all killed without the \nqasama. In other words, the murder is established by evidence or \nconfession. If the qasama is required, then only someone directly \nconnected to the murder is killed when the blow was not \nimmediately. Then only one is killed through the qasama process. \nWhen this happens, the rest are given a hundred lashes and \nimprisoned for a year.]  \n \n37.1c When the qasama is necessitated  \n \nQasama is obliged by the statement of the dying man, \"So-\nand-so killed me\" or there is a witness to the killing, or two \nwitnesses to the wounding if he then survives long enough \nafterwards to eat and drink.  \n \nIn the first case, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and all his \npeople do not disagree that it is suspicion of deliberate murder \nwhich obliges the qasama and retaliation. The same applies to a \nsingle eye-witness to the killing, when he is reputable. The \nrelatives swear with his testimony and they are entitled to his life.  \n \n[Hashiyya: This is when the victim who makes the statement is \nadult, free, Muslim and sane. There is disagreement about \naccidental killing. The well-known position is that the relatives \ntake the qasama and are entitled to blood money. It is said that \nthere is no qasama in that because it is a financial claim, and that \nis reported from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nAs for the witness to the killing, it would appear from the wording \nthat the witness can be reputable or not, and this is reported from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). The well-known position is \nthat that does not constitute suspicion because his testimony is \nomitted legally. Two women are like one man in this. Death also \nhas to established for the process to continue.]  \n \nThere is also the case where two witnesses testify to seeing the \ninjury, meaning the blow, or the blow. That is also considered \nsuspicion when there is testimony of one reputable eye-witness to \nthe injury or the blow, deliberate or accidental, according to the \nstatement of the victim, \"So-and-so wounded me, or hit me.\" Then \nthe relatives take the qasama, swearing that he died of that \nwound or blow. If he dies immediately or is struck a mortal blow, \nhe is killed for him without qasama. \"Eating and drinking\" is not \nmeant literally, but refers to a delay after eye-witness of the \nwounding or blow, for a day or more, even if the victim does not \neat or drink.  \n \n37.1d When the claimants refuse to swear  \n \nIf those who claim blood refuse to swear, then the one \naccused must swear fifty oaths. If he cannot find those \namong his relatives who will swear with him, then the \naccused himself swears fifty oaths. If a group are accused \nof murder, then each of them must swear fifty oaths.  \n \nIf all or some of them refuse to take the oath for the deliberate \nkilling when the qasama is obliged by the statement of the victim \nor a witness to the killing, then the suspect swears with them. If \nthe accused swears fifty oaths, then he is innocent. If he refuses, \nhe is imprisoned until he swears and he is not released from \nprison unless he swears.  \n \n[Hashiyya: This is when the relatives of the deceased are the \nsame degree in lineage or closer than others, as when the son \nrefuses when the uncle is present. Such a refusal is not considered \nif the one who refuses has a more distant degree, as when an \nuncle refuses when the brother is present.]  \n \nIn the case of an accused group, each swears fifty oaths and is only \ninnocent by swearing fifty oaths.  \n \n37.1d Fifty oaths  \n \nWhen the relatives seek blood, fifty men swear fifty oaths. \nIf they are less than that, the oaths are divided between \nthem. A woman does not swear in a case of premeditated \nmurder.  \n \nShaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"This is the \nposition of 'Abdu'l-Malik (radhi‟Allahu anhu). It is that it is not \npermitted for only two to swear when there are more present. If \nthere are less than fifty, then the oaths are divided between them. \nIf there are two then each swears 25 oaths.\" If there are more \nthan fifty, then fifty of them satisfy the requirement.  \n \nA woman does not swear in a case of willful killing, whether or not \nthere is a male with her because being male is a precondition to \nthe entitlement to taking blood by the qasama. If there are only \nwomen, then the victim becomes like someone with no heirs and \nthe accused must swear the oaths to clear himself.  \n \n[If the accused then refuses to swear, he is imprisoned until he \ndoes so.]  \n \n37.1e Accidental homicide  \n \nIn the case of an accidental homicide, the heirs, male or \nfemale, swear according to what they inherit of the blood \nmoney. If the division of the oaths is uneven, then the one \nwith the largest share swears the remaining oath.  \n \nIn the case of two, each swear twenty-five oaths. In three, each \nswear 16 and two-thirds oaths, so each mends the shortfall which \ngoes to his portion and so they each swear 17 oaths. If the division \nis uneven and, for instance, there is a son and a daughter, the \nfactor is three and the male swears 33 and a third and the female \n16 and two-thirds, and so the female has the larger fraction and so \nthe daughter swears 16 oaths.  \n \n37.1f Oaths of heirs is a precondition  \n \nWhen some of the heirs are present swear to gain the blood \nmoney on account of accidental killing, they must swear all \nthe oaths. Then those after them later swear according to \ntheir shares of the inheritance.  \n \nThe oaths must total fifty in Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nview. Otherwise they are not entitled to any of the blood money. \nWhen those who were absent at the time of the swearing arrive \nlater, then they swear and the oaths of those present before them \nis not sufficient. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat that is because part of the precondition of taking this \nproperty is to have the oaths. When the one who is present \nswears, he is entitled to his share of it, and any heir who comes \nlater must swear according to his portion of the oaths and then he \ntakes his share. He does no swear all since the earlier swore all \nthe oaths.  \n \n37.1g Manner of swearing  \n \nThey swear the oaths while standing. People living in the \nprovinces of Makka, Madina or Jerusalem should be \nbrought to those places to perform the qasama. People of \nother provinces are not summoned to their provincial \ncenter unless they are a short distance from it.  \n \nThis description of taking oath applies to the qasama and to oaths \nsworn for financial rights. In the well-known position, it is done \nstanding to deter them lest falsehood refute truth.  \n \n[Hashiyya: There are two views about what happens if they \nrefuse to swear standing. Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that it can be done while sitting. Standing, however, is \nthe well-known position of the School, and refusing to do so \nnullifies the right to blood money.]  \n \nThe apparent meaning of the text is that the time is not made \nhard for them, but the place is.  \n \nThe meaning of provinces is that those who are subject to those \nlocations are summoned to those places for the qasama to make it \nhard for them, even if there is a great distance between them and \nthese places, like ten days, because that will deter the liar because \nof the nobility of the site. That only applies to these three places. \nWhat constitutes a short distance varies in definition. Some say \nthree days and some say ten days.  \n \n37.1h Not swearing for wounds  \n \nThere is no qasama in the case of wounds, nor for slaves, \nor one of the People of the Book, nor if the body is found \nbetween the battle lines or found in the quarter of people.  \n \nThis is when someone wounds someone else and has no evidence. \nThere is no qasama. There is retaliation for deliberate wounding \nand blood money for the accidental, i.e. when there are two \nwitnesses, there is blood money for the accidental and retaliation \nfor the deliberate. If there is only one witness, he swears one oath \nwith the witness and takes the blood money for the accidental \ninjury and retaliation for the deliberate [when there is equality]. If \nthe claimant does not swear, the wounder is free if he swears an \noath. Otherwise he is imprisoned for the deliberate wound and \nindebted for the accidental.  \n \nThere is no qasama for killing a slave because he has a lower rank \nthan the free. When it is established that a person killed him by \ntwo witnesses, he is liable for his price, whether intentional or \naccidental, whatever it is, and he receives a hundred lashes and is \nimprisoned for a year.  \n \nThere is no qasama between People of the Book. This does not \nmean if the killer and victim are both unbelievers. What is meant \nis when a dhimmi is found dying and says, \"I was killed by so-and-\nso,\" who is a Muslim, and two reputable men witness his \nstatement, there is no qasama for him. He owes his blood money \nfrom his own property if it was deliberate and the 'aqila (tribe) \npay if it was accidental. If there is only the claim of a relative of \nthe unbeliever against a Muslim , one pays no attention to it.  \n \nThere is no qasama for someone found between battle lines of \nMuslims when the two groups are following their interpretation \nsince each group believes it is permitted to kill the other since he \ntakes its money, for instance, and one of them dies, his blood has \nno legal consequence.  \n \nThere is no qasama a victim is found in the quarter of a people, \nand the place where the victim was found was one where people \nother than the people who live there pass through it. If other than \nits people do not pass through it and a murder victim is found is \nfrom other than its people. That constitutes inadequate evidence.  \n \n37.2 Pardon  \n \n37.2a No pardon in murder for gain  \n \nThere is no pardon in the case of murder done for financial \ngain.  \n \n When someone kills a person in order to take his property, then it \nis not permitted to pardon him, or there is no pardon which is \neffective, even if the victim was an unbeliever and the killer a free \nMuslim because killing in this way is hiraba [aggravated robbery] \nand when the robber kills, he must be killed, even if it is for a \nslave or an unbeliever. Pardon is not permitted in this because it \nis the right of Allah azza wa jall. According to this, he is killed by \na hadd punishment, not retaliation. \n  \n[Hashiyya: Pardon in this case cannot be issued by the victim, \nrelatives or ruler, even if the victim is an unbeliever, because this \nis a right of Allah azza wa jall and pardon is not permitted in it.]  \n \n37.2b The victim pardoning his killer  \n \nA man may pardon his murderer if he was not killed for \nfinancial gain. He may pardon for accidental killing from \nthe disposable third of his state.  \n \nThis is when he pardons after he has been dealt a mortal blow, \nand then the relatives cannot say anything. If it is accidental, that \nhas to come from the third because of the blood money is part of \nhis property and the heirs can forbid him to dispose of more than a \nthird because his financial dealings are restricted while he is in \nthis condition.  \n \n37.2c Pardon granted by the heirs  \n \nIf one of the sons of the victim pardons, then the killer is \nnot killed, but the other heirs still receive their shares of \nthe blood money. Daughters cannot pardon when there are \nsons.  \n \nThis is once the right to blood has been established and the son is \nan adult. The killer is not killed because blood cannot be divided. \nIf part of it is canceled, it is all canceled. When one of the sons \ncancels killing or forgoes his share, the other sons still are entitled \nto their shares of the blood money. When there are sons, \ndaughters do not pardon, nor do sisters pardon when there are \nbrothers. Pardon and taking in full is a right of the 'asaba [male \npaternal relatives] rather than that of the females equal with \nthem.  \n \n37.2d Punishment of a pardoned murderer  \n \nSomeone who is pardoned for willful killing receives a \nhundred lashes and is imprisoned for a year.  \n \nThis also applies when retaliation cannot be carried out on the \nkiller because of lack of equality, as when a Muslim kills an \nunbeliever. This punishment was carried out by the Salaf, may \nAllah azza wa jall be pleased with all of them.  \n \nII BLOOD MONEY  \n \n37.3 The tariff for blood money (diya)  \n \n37.3a The tariff for accidental homicide  \n \nThe blood money for people with camels is one hundred \ncamels. For those who use gold, it is one thousand dinars, \nand for those who use silver it is twelve thousand dirhams.  \n \nDiya is derived from wadi, which means destruction. Since it is \nobliged by death, it is called that. It is a technical term for the \nindemnity obliged by killing a human being in recompense for his \nblood. What is obliged in killing another can be called his value as \nwhat is obliged on account of killing a slave is his value. Blood \nmoney is obliged by the words of the Allah azza wa jall, \"Anyone \nwho kills a believer by mistake should free a believing slave and \npay blood-money to his family.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:91)  \n \nIn the Muwatta', the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) is \nreported as stating that blood money is \"one hundred camels for a \nlife.\" There is consensus on that. \n  \nIt varies according to the perpetuator. People with camels are \nnomads and tent people. It is one hundred camels taken from five \ncategories. People of gold are like the people of Egypt and Syria, \nand people of silver are like the people of Iraq. His words imply \nthat blood money is only from these three categories, and that is \nthe case in the well-known position. It is not taken from cattle nor \nsheep nor goods. \n  \n[Hashiyya: If, however, both parties agree on something else, it \nsatisfies the requirement. Those who oppose the well-known \nposition and allow cattle and the like, say that it is two hundred \nhead of cattle and one thousand sheep. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said in the Muwatta', \"The generally agreed on way of \ndoing things in our community is that camels are not accepted \nfrom the people of cities for blood-money nor is gold or silver \naccepted from desert people. Silver is not accepted from the people \nof gold and gold is not accepted from the people of silver.\"]  \n \n37.3b The tariff for willful killing  \n \nThe blood money for murder, if accepted, in camels is \ntwenty five four year old she-camels, twenty five five year \nold she-camels, twenty five three year old she camels and \ntwenty five two year old she-camels The blood money for \naccidental homicide is twenty of each type and twenty \nmale three year old camels.  \n \nIf blood money is accepted or retaliation impossible due to the \ndisparity, then the camels consist of these four types: twenty five \nwhich are hiqqa, twenty five which are jadha'a, twenty five which \nare bint labun, and twenty five which are bint makhad. In the \ncase of the accidental killing, there are twenty of each of the four \ncategories, as well as twenty three-year old male camels (ibn \nlabun). The blood money for intentional killing has less categories \nthan the accidental killing, even thought the number is the same.  \nMale camels are less valuable than female ones.  \n \n37.3c When a father kills his son  \n \nThe blood money is made more exacting in the case a \nfather who kills his son by throwing a piece of iron at him \nand killing him. He is not put to death for his death, but he \nmust pay thirty, five year old she-camels, thirty, four year \nold she-camels and forty khalifas, which are pregnant \ncamels. It is said that the 'aqila [the tribe] pay that and it \nis also said that it comes from his own property.  \n \nThis includes anything which he does without the intention to kill \nhim. He is not executed because of the respect for fatherhood. If \ncircumstances indicate the he actually intended to kill him, then \nhe is killed for him in the well-known position.  \n \nImam Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes the position of Imam \nAbu \nHanifa \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nImam \nash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that the father is not killed for his son \nbecause he was the reason for his existence. Included in this \njudgment are mothers and grandparents. \n  \nThere is disagreement about who pays the blood money. The well-\nknown position is that the killer, father or anyone else, pays it \nimmediately and it is not delayed. If he has property at that time, \nit is taken from him. Otherwise it awaits his wealth. It is said that \nthis heavier blood money is owed by the 'aqila (tribe). Shaikh ibn \nal-'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is the tribe which pays \nthe blood money. It is said that it comes out of his own property if \nhe has property. If he does not, then the tribe pays it.  \n \n37.4 The tariff for other than Muslim men  \n \n37.4a Half the tariff  \n \nThe blood money of a woman is half that of a man. The \nsame applies to the blood money of Kitabis, and their \nwomen is half of that of their men.  \n \nThe blood money of a free Muslim woman is half that of a free \nMuslim man. So her blood money is fifty camels, in fourths or \nfifths according to whether the killing is accidental or deliberate. \nThe more severe form [if the victim is a daughter] is 2/3rds of \nsixteen and a third of camels from every type. In money, it is five \nhundred gold dinars and six thousand silver dirhams.  \n \nThe same is true for the Jews and Christians. It is half that of the \nMuslims based on what Shaikh an-Nasa'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nreports that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \nblood wit of the people of the dhimma is half that of the Muslims. \nThere is half of that blood money for Kitabi women.  \n \n37.4b Magians  \n \nA Magian's blood money is eight hundred dirhams and that \nof their women half of that. The same principle applies to \npenalties for wounds.  \n \nA Magian, who is not a Kitabi, has this amount in silver and in \ngold it is sixty-six dinars and in camels, six and two-thirds in \ncamels. Their women have half of that. The same portion applies \nto wounds.  \n \n37.5 Blood money for mutilation  \n \n37.5a Full blood money for hands, feet and eyes  \n \nThere is full blood money for loss of both hands or feet or \neyes, and it is half for the loss of one of them.  \n \nThe full money is for the loss of both. There is half for loss of one. \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"This is for \naccidental wounding. When it is deliberate, retaliation can be \ntaken from the criminal.\"  \n \n37.5b Full blood money  \n \nThere is full blood money due for cutting the cartilage of \nthe nose, causing loss of hearing, causing loss of mental \nunderstanding, breaking the back, crushing the testicles, \ncutting off the penis, and cutting off of the tongue or \ndamaging it so that the victim cannot speak. There is full \nblood money due for destroying the breasts of a woman or \nfor causing the loss of the eye of someone with one eye.  \n \nIf only part of the nose is cut, then it is calculated according to the \ndamage. There is full blood money for causing loss of hearing. If it \nonly one ear, then it is half, even if he only hears by it. When his \nmental faculties are impaired because a blow, there is full blood \nmoney. When his mental faculties is impaired by the amputation \nof his hands, he is owed double blood money. If both testicles and \npenis are cut off, double blood money is owed.  \n \n[The is half blood money for one testicle.]  \n \nIn the case of the tongue, if someone cuts off part of it by which \none speaks and he cannot speak, that entails full blood money \nbecause the tongue is for speech, not touching. There is discretion \n[hukuma] on any other part of the tongue. Hukuma means that \nthe one evaluates the victim like a sound slave. If a sound slave is \nworth ten, for instance, then after the injury is estimated at nine, \nthe difference is a tenth, and so a tenth of the blood money is \ndemanded.  \n \nThere is full blood money for the breasts of a woman, whether the \ncutting is partial or total. There is full blood money for the loss of \nthe single eye of a one-eyed person when that is accidental. If it is \ndeliberate, that will be mentioned.  \n \n37.6 Tariff for lesser wounds  \n \n37.6a. The mudiha and loss of fingers and toes  \n \nFor a mudiha wound, which is a head wound which \nexposes the skull, the penalty is five camels. There is the \nsame amount for loss of a tooth. There are ten camels due \nfor the loss of each finger or toe, and three and a third for \nthe tips of fingers and toes, and five camels for the tips of \nthe thumb or big toe.  \n \nThese amounts are for accidental wounds. There is retaliation for \ndeliberate wounding. In the case of loss of a tooth, that also \napplies if it becomes very disordered [and turns black or is \ndiscolored], and whether it is from the front or the back. In the \ncase of tips of fingers, a finger has three parts, and there is a third \nof each part. Again, this is in the case of accidental injury. There \nis retaliation for the deliberate wounding.  \n \n37.6b Other wounds  \n \nThere is fifteen per cent for a munaqqila wound. The \nmudiha is a head wound which exposes the bone and the \nmunaqqila is one affects the skull, but does not reach the \nbrain. If it reaches the brain it is a ma'muma wound, and \nthere is a third of the blood money for it. The same holds \nfor ja'ifa (abdominal) wound.  \n \nFifteen per cent is 15 camels and intentional and accidental \ninjuries are the same in it and there is no retaliation in such a \nwound since it can prove lethal.  \n \n[Fifteen per cent is one hundred fifty dinars or one thousand eight \nhundred dirhams.]  \n \nThe mudiha exposes the bone and removes the skin and flesh \nwhich covers it. It is only on the head, forehead and cheeks. A \nwound is mudiha if it exposes the amount of a needle of the bone.  \n \nA munaqqila wound is one which chips the bone but which does \nnot reach the brain. Any wound which reaches the brain, even the \namount of a needle, while there still remains a thin membrane on \nthe brain which, if removed, would result in death, is called a \nma'muna. It is only on the head or forehead. There a third of the \nblood money for it, which is 33 1/3 camels, or three hundred \nthirty-three dinars or four thousand dirhams.  \n \nA ja'ifa wound is one which reaches the gut and it is only in the \nback or abdomen. It obliges a third of the blood money.  \n \n37.6c Lesser wounds  \n \nOne exercises ijtihad [discretion] in the case of a wound \nless than a mudiha and in the case of other wounds.  \n \nCases whose amounts are not specified by the Shari‟ah are \ndecided by judicial determination [hukuma]. It is that one \nestimates the decrease in the value of a sound slave after \nreceiving such a wound. For instance, if the slave was worth ten \non the day of the injury and afterwards is worth nine, there is a \ntenth of the blood money owed. It is the same in a wound less than \na ja'ifa wound which is accidental.  \n \nThere is only hukuma.  \n \n37.6d Waiting for the wound to heal  \n \nThe blood money for a wound is only paid after it has \nhealed. If a wound less than a mudiha heals without \nleaving a scar, there is no compensation for it.  \n \nIt is only paid after it heals because it is not known whether full \nmoney is obliged for it or not. Similarly, there is no retaliation \ntaken until after the wound has healed. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. If it leaves no scar and is less than \na mudiha or a ja'ifa, there is no blood money. What is understood \nfrom what he says is that there is something for something which \nheals with a scar, and that is based on the principle of hukuma as \nalready explained.  \n \n37.7 Retaliation (Qisas)  \n \nThere is retaliation for deliberate wounds, unless such a \nwound may prove fatal, such as a ma'muna, ja'ifa, and \nmunaqqila, or breaking a thigh, crushing the testicles, \nbreaking the back, and such injuries. Blood money is paid \nfor such injuries.  \n \nIn the case of wounds which would probably lead to death quickly, \nlike crushing the testicles, breaking the breast bone and breaking \nthe back, blood money is paid for an intentional injury, i.e. blood \nmoney is calculated in it. The blood money is paid in full if the \ninjury demands full blood money, like breaking the breastbone, \nneck or back, or a third or a tenth or a twentieth as was made \nclear.  \n \n[Hashiyya: In the case of deliberate injury, the Qadi must \ndiscipline the perpetrator, whether or not retaliation is taken.]  \n \n37.8 The clan's obligation in the blood money  \n \n37.8a Responsibility for the accidental, not the willful  \n \nThe 'aqila (tribe) do not have to pay for deliberate murder \nnor for homicide based on confession. They can pay for \naccidental injuries if the amount is a third or more of the \nfull blood money. Amounts less than a third are paid by the \nperpetrator from his own property.  \n \nThey do not have to pay the blood money for intentional killing in \nwhich retaliation is canceled by pardon or anything else which \ncancels it. Then it is immediately due from the property of the \nperpetrator. The aqila do not have to pay for the accidental which \nis based on confession, and the perpetrator must pay it himself \nbecause of possible collusion between the killer and the relatives \nof the victim.  \n \nThe 'aqila are called that because they pay ('aqila) the blood \nmoney for him.  \n \n37.8b Major wounds and the 'aqila  \n \nAs for a deliberate ma'muna or ja'ifa wound, Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the blood money paid by the \ntribe ('aqila). He also said that it is said that it is paid from \nhis property unless the perpetrator is without money. \nThen the 'aqila pay it because there is no retaliation in the \ncase of such wounds when they are deliberate. It is the \nsame with penalties which reach a third of the blood \nmoney when there is no retaliation because that might \nprove fatal.  \n \n The first is the well-known position. Retaliation is not taken \nwhen it might result in death.  \n \n37.8c The clan does not pay for a suicide  \n \nThe 'aqila does not pay anything for someone who kills \nhimself either deliberately or accidentally.  \n \nIt is blood with no consequence since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Whoever kills a believer accidentally..\" and \nso the blood money is obliged for the one who kills someone else. \nThat indicates that it is not obliged when someone kills himself.  \n \n \n37.9 Blood money paid to a woman  \n \nA woman is paid the same compensation as the man up to a \nthird of the blood money of a man. If compensation reaches \na third, it reverts to her portion of the blood money (which \nis half).  \n \nUp to a third is taken for things like her limbs as it is for the man \nwith the same amount as that for a man. When the amount is \nmore than a third, the tariff reverts to the blood money of women. \nWhen three of her fingers are severed, she is owed thirty camels \nsince compensation is equal to a man in what is less than a third \nof his blood money. When four of her fingers are cut, she has 20 \ncamels because if they were equal, she would be obliged forty and \nthat is more than a third, and so it reverts to half of what is \nobliged for a man, which is 20. The people of Madina and the \nseven fuqaha' agree on that. \n \n37.10 Cases where the parties are unequal  \n \n37.10a Murder by a group  \n \nWhen a group murder a man, they are all killed for his \nmurder.  \n \nLinguistically a group is from three to ten, but for the fuqaha', it is \nsimply a group. They are all killed if they colluded to kill him.  \n \n[Hashiyya: It makes no difference between they participated in \nthe actual deed or only some did it while the others were present. \nIt is the same if the victim was a woman.] \n  \n37.10b Murder by someone drunk or insane  \n \nIf a drunk kills, he is killed. If a madman kills, his tribe pay \nthe blood money.  \n \nSomeone drunk by drinking what is forbidden, like wine, knowing \nthat it forbidden but deliberately drinks it. That is because he \nvoluntarily becomes drunk and so has no excuse. If he becomes \nintoxicated from medicine, then he has an excuse. This is when he \nkills someone protected who is his equal or higher.  \n \nThe mad person is one who does not recover. The 'aqila pay his \nblood money when it reaches a third. \n  \nIt is the same when he has bouts of insanity and kills someone in \none of those bouts. If he kills someone in a period of sanity and \nthen goes mad, he is executed when he regains his sanity.  \n \n37.10c Minors  \n \nThe deliberate injury inflicted by a minor is the same as an \naccidental one. It is paid by the 'aqila if it is a third of the \nblood money or more. Otherwise it comes from his own \nproperty.  \n \nThere is no retaliation taken from a minor.  \n \n37.10d When the victim is of the opposite sex  \n \nA woman is killed for a man and a man for a woman. \nRetaliation is exacted from each for wounds.  \n \nThere is agreement about a woman being killed for a man. The \nmajority say that a man is killed for a woman since Allah azza wa \njall says, \"We prescribed in it for them: a life for a life,\" (Holy \nQur‟an 5:47) and that abrogates His words, \"free man for free \nman.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:177)  \n \nRetaliation is exacted for wounds since Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Retaliation for wounds.\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:47)  \n \n37.10e Free and slave  \n \nA free man is not killed for a slave, but a slave is killed for \na free man.  \n \nA free Muslim is not killed for a slave. A free non-Muslim is killed \nfor a Muslim slave. If a free Muslim kills a slave, he owes his price \nand the value of any wounds he inflicts. A slave is killed for a free \nMuslim. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) says, that that is \nwhen the relatives want that because they can choose between \nkilling him or letting him live. If they let him live, the master can \nchoose between handing over the slave or paying the blood money \nof a victim.  \n \n37.19f Non-Muslims and Muslims  \n \nA Muslim is not killed for an unbeliever but an unbeliever \nis killed for a Muslim.  \n \nIt does not matter whether the Muslim is free or a slave, but an \nunbeliever is killed for a free or slave Muslim.  \n \n37.10g No retaliation between unequal’s  \n \nThere is no retaliation between a free man and slave in the \ncause of wounds, nor between a Muslim and an unbeliever.  \n \nThat is because equality is obliged for blood. In short, if the victim \nand perpetrator are equal in freedom and Islam, retaliation can be \ntaken from him for homicide and wounds. If the perpetrator is \nhigher in either category, there is no retaliation in wounds or \nhomicide. If the perpetrator is lower than him, there is retaliation \nin homicide, but not wounds.  \n \nThere is no retaliation between Muslim and unbeliever in wounds. \nIf a Muslim injures an unbeliever, he owes the blood money for \nthat limb if it has a specific blood money. If it is not specified, \nthere is judicial discretion (hukuma). If an unbeliever injures a \nMuslim, he pays the blood money in that for which there is a \nspecific blood money, and there is hukuma in what is less than \nthat.  \n \n37.11 Cases of no legal liability (hadar)  \n \n37.11a Damage done by animals  \n \nSomeone who is driving, leading or riding an animal is \nliable for anything that the animal tramples on. If the \nanimal tramples on something which was not a result of \nwhat the person did, or while it is stopped without \nanything done to it, there is no legal liability for that.  \n \nThe driver drives the animals from behind. They are liable for \nwhat the animal destroys with its feet, but not for what it destroys \nwith its tail or mouth, or if it is standing and is not provoked by a \nblow or goad. There is no penalty for this by the sound \ntransmission that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"There is no blood money for a dumb animal. There is no blood \nmoney for a well and there is no blood money for a mine.\"  \n \n37.11b Wells and mines  \n \nIf someone dies in a well or a mine without any one doing \nsomething to cause that, there is no liability.  \n \nWhen someone falls down a well or mine, like someone who works \nin it and dies. His employer is not charged in it because he has not \ndown anything for which he would be responsible and hence he \nhas no liability.  \n \n37.12 When and by whom blood money is paid  \n \nThe tribe ('aqila) pay the blood money in installments over \nthree years. If it a third of the blood rate is owed, it is paid \nin a year. If it is half, it is paid over two years. Blood \nmoney is inherited according to the shares of inheritance.  \n \nFull blood money is paid for the accidental killing of a Muslim or \nsomeone else. A third of the tariff is due for injuries like that of a \nma'muna and ja'ifa. Half would be due if the victim had lost a \nhand or foot. Full blood money can also be paid be installments \nover four years. [The installments are paid in equal amounts. Less \nthan full blood money can be paid in monthly installments]  \n \nBlood money, whether willful or accidental, is inherited according \nto the shares of inheritance. Each of the heirs takes the portion \nallotted him in the Book of Allah. \n \n37.13 Ghurra penalty for causing a miscarriage  \n \nThere is a ghurra owed for causing the loss of the fetus of a \nfree woman. A ghurra is a slave or slavegirl worth fifty \ndinars or six hundred dirhams. The ghurra is inherited by \nthe heirs according to the Book of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nThat is a twentieth of the blood money of the father or a tenth of \nthat of the mother. The well known position is that only gold \nrather than camels is paid for the ghurra. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. \n  \n[Hashiyya: This ruling applies to free Muslim or Kitabi woman \nwhen the father is a Muslim, even if the pregnancy is the result of \nillicit sex. It is a pregnancy which would accord umm walad status \nto a slavegirl and can consist of a lump of flesh, a clot or congealed \nblood. The miscarriage is the result of a blow. This is when the \nchild is born dead. If it is born alive, but dies because of the injury, \nfull blood money is due.]  \n \n37.14 Killing a Relative  \n \nSomeone who deliberately kills someone does not inherit \neither his property or his blood money. Someone who kills \na relative by accident inherits his property, but not the \nblood money.  \n \nHe does not veil anyone since the one who does not inherit does \nnot veil an heir. In the case of accidental homicide, he inherits and \nveils. The form of that is that when there are three brothers. One \nof them kills another and the third inherits a third from the blood \nmoney because there is only one brother with the killer because \nthe killer does not inherit from the blood money but does inherit a \nsixth from the property because the killer inherits from the \nbrother and veils the other brother, reducing his share from a \nthird to a sixth.  \n \n37.15 Ghurra in the case causing a slavegirl to miscarry  \n \nThere is the same tariff for causing the loss of a fetus of a \nslave girl pregnant by her master as there is for causing a \nfree woman to miscarry. If she was pregnant by someone \nelse, the fine is a tenth of the value of the mother.  \n \nThis is when the master is free and she miscarries. A ghurra is \ndue in the form of a slave or slavegirl. The umm walad is called a \nslavegirl (ama) here, which is not the technical term. If the parent \nis not the master, then compensation is a tenth for a fetus \nwhatever the sex of the miscarried fetus. \n \n37.16 Killing a slave  \n \nIf someone kills a slave, he owes his value.  \n \nIf a Muslim kills a slave, he owes his price from his own property, \nwhether it is accidental or deliberate unless he kills him for \nfinancial gain. Then he is executed for Allah azza wa jall's right.  \n \n37.17 Collective murder  \n \nIf a group of people kills someone in aggravated robbery \n(hiraba) or for financial gain, they are all killed, even if \nonly one of them did the actual killing.  \n \nWhether they kill a free Muslim, slave or dhimmi. Killing for \nmoney is in order to steal his property and hiraba, according to \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi), consists of every action \nwhich is intended to take property when someone cannot normally \nseek help, whether a man or woman does that.  \n \nAnyone who commit highway robbery or causes alarm on the \nroads is a muharib. The one who commits this must be adult and \nsane. It can be in a city or a town.  \n \nThey are all executed when all of them undertake the killing, even \nif only one of them does it. If one of them decides on that without \nany collusion on their part before, that is different from hiraba \nand gain, and they are not all killed for one unless they conspired \nto kill him or if they all take part in it. \n \n37.18 Atonement for homicide  \n \nAtonement (kaffarah) for accidental killing is mandatory. \nIt consists of freeing a Muslim slave, or, if that is not \npossible, then fasting for two consecutive months. If \nsomeone is pardoned for willful killing, this is best for him.  \n \nShaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is not a \nprecondition that the killer be legally responsible. That is taken \nfrom the property of a child or mad person because that is what is \nprescribed A slave freed to fulfill the kaffarah must be Muslim, \nfree of defects and a full slave. In fasting, the kaffarah is two \nconsecutive months. If he does not fast that consecutively and \nbreaks it deliberately, he must start again. If it is due to \nforgetfulness or illness, he does not start again. This expiation is \nalso recommended for the one who has been pardoned for willful \nkilling because of the gravity of what he did.  \n \nIII CRIMES AGAINST ISLAM  \n \n37.19 Crimes against Islam \n \n37.19a Zandaqa  \n \nA zindiq is killed and his repentance is not accepted. He is \nthe one who conceals disbelief while making an outward \ndisplay of Islam.  \n \nThis is a hadd punishment, not for disbelief, i.e. when he repents \nafter we have exposed him. The legal consequences are that when \nhe is killed for a hadd, his property goes to his heirs. An example \nof his repentance after being exposed is that he denies the \nzandaqa which is proven against him. If he admits it and does not \nrepent, his killing is not a hadd. It is disbelief and so his property \nis that of an apostate and his heirs do not inherit. His property \ngoes to the Muslim treasury. If he repents, it is not accepted. It is \naccepted if he comes in repentance before he is exposed. Such a \nperson was considered a hypocrite in the time of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n37.19b Sorcery  \n \nThe same is true for a sorcerer. His repentance is not \naccepted.  \n \nHe is killed without being asked to repent once he has been \nexposed. If he comes in repentance before he is exposed, then his \nrepentance is accepted.  \n \n37.19c Apostasy  \n \nAn apostate is killed unless he repents. He is given three \ndays to repent. The same ruling applies to a woman. \n  \nSomeone who recants from Islam. Apostasy is disbelief after \naffirming Islam. If he does not repent, he is killed. One does not \nexecute him immediately but repentance is offered to him. If he \nrefuses then he is killed. It is obligatory to delay execution for \nthree days. If he repents, there is no problem. If not, he is killed \nafter sunset on the third day. This judgment includes men and \nwomen. A pregnant woman is deferred until she gives birth. \n  \n[Hashiyya: The School is that he is offered Islam every day \nwithout being punished by beating or pain or made thirsty and \nwithout threats.]  \n \n37.19d Someone who refuses to pray  \n \nIf someone has not apostatized but affirms the prayer and \nyet says, \"I will not pray,\" he is given a respite until the \ntime of the next prayer. If he does not pray, he is killed.  \n \n\"I will not pray now and will pray later\" or \"I will not pray at all.\" \nHe is still in the daruri time in which he can pray one rak'at \nwithout considering being at rest or balance or recitation of the \nFatiha. This is to protect blood as much as possible. If he rises to \npray, there is no problem. Otherwise he is killed with the sword \nimmediately.  \n \n37.19e Refusing to pay zakat  \n \nIf someone refuses to pay zakat, it is taken from him by \nforce.  \n \nEven if it leads to fighting him, and if he dies in that, his blood is \nof no consequence.  \n \n37.19f Refusing to go on hajj  \n \nIf someone does not go on hajj, he is left to Allah azza wa \njall.  \n \nHe is not threatened by death or anything else since he may not \nhave all the preconditions for the hajj, even if that seems so \noutwardly.  \n \n37.19g Not praying out of denial  \n \nSomeone who abandons the prayer out of denial of its \nobligatory is like an apostate. He is asked to repent for \nthree days. If he does not repent, he is killed.  \n \nThe obligatory prayer. Denial means to reject its obligatory \nnature. Such a person is killed for disbelief and not by a hadd. \nThen the funeral prayer is not said for him and he is not buried in \nthe Muslim cemetery and there is no inheritance between him and \nhis heirs and his property goes to the Muslim treasury. \n  \n[Hashiyya: The same applies to the one who denies the obligatory \nnature of zakat.] \n  \n37.19h Insulting the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) \n \nIf someone curses the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) he is \nkilled and his repentance is not accepted. If one of the \npeople of dhimma abuses him (alaihi salat wa salam) outside \nof that which constitutes his disbelief or curses Allah azza \nwa jall other than what constitutes his disbelief, he is \nkilled unless he becomes Muslim.  \n \nWhen he says something to deprecate him. His execution is a hadd \nand hence it is of no use if he repents or denies it when there is \nclear evidence of it. Repentance does not cancel a hadd. This is \nwhy he says that his repentance is not accepted.  \n \nThe same principle applies to someone who curses one of the \nProphets (may Allah azza wa jall bless them all)or one of the \nangels or denies one of the Books of Allah azza wa jall. If someone \nabuses someone whose prophethood is a matter of dispute, like al-\nKhidr \n, he is strongly punished but not killed.  \n \nStatements of dhimmis which constitutes their disbelief would be \nthings like a Jew saying, \"He is not a messenger to us, Our \nMessenger is Musa (alaihi salam).\" Abuse beyond their intrinsic \ndisbelief would be criticizing the character of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). An example of that which constitutes his \ndisbelief is saying that God is three or that He has a son.  \n \n37.19i Estate of an apostate  \n \nThe estate of the apostate goes to the Muslim community.  \n \nIt is placed in the treasury.  \n \n37.20 Aggravated robbery (hiraba)  \n \n37.20a No pardon  \n \nA bandit may not be pardoned when he is caught.  \n \nThis is when he is captured before he repents because that is a \nhadd.  \n \n37.20b His punishment  \n \nIf he has killed anyone, he must be killed. If he has not \nkilled anyone, the ruler should exercise his discretion \naccording to the seriousness of his crime and the length of \ntime he has been a robber. He may execute him, or crucify \nhim and then execute him, or cut off his opposite foot and \nhand, or exile him to another town to be imprisoned there \nuntil he repents.  \n \nWhether his victim was a slave or unbeliever, he is still executed, \neven if the relatives of the victim pardon because it is a right of \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \nThis also applies to assisting in the killing by striking or holding \nthe victim. This also applies to adult. A child is not killed, but \npunished.  \n \nIf he has not killed, the ruler takes into consideration that which \nhe think will be an adequate deterrent. If is strong, he receives the \nstrongest of the punishments which is the cutting off the alternate \nhand and foot. If he is not strong, it is the easier punishment, \nwhich is exile. The basis of this is the words of the Almighty, \"The \nreprisal against those who wage war on Allah and His Messenger \nand go about the earth corrupting it, is that they should be killed \nor crucified, or have their alternate hands and feet cut off, or be \nbanished from the land.\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:35) Execution is in the \nnormal way with the sword or the spear in the throat. Crucifixion \nis being tied to a post standing, not inverted. Alternate cutting is \nto cut off the left hand and right foot. If he commits robbery after \nthat, he is killed.  \n \n37.20c When a robber repents before he is captured  \n \nIf he is not caught until he comes in repentance, none of \nthese rights, which are Allah's rights, are exacted. The \nrights of people are taken in the form of blood or property.  \n \nNone of the penalties for aggravated robbery are applied because \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"except for those who repent before you \ngain power over them.\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:36)  \n \nAs for the rights of human beings and other rights of Allah azza \nwa jall, like those for illicit sex and drinking wine, these are not \ncanceled at all. So he is liable for the crimes he committed in the \ncourse of his banditry because repentance has no effect on the \nrights of people. They are is taken from his property and he is \nindebted for it if he has no property.  \n \n37.20d Individual responsibility  \n \nEach member of a gang of thieves is liable for all the \nproperty they take. The entire group is executed for the \nmurder of one person in banditry or for financial gain, \neven if only one of them did the actual killing.  \n \nThief here means the robber (muharib), not a simple thief.  \n \nShaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that when a group of \nthieves help one another, they are guilty of aggravated robbery. \nThis is the predominant view. The same applies to rebels and \nusurpers when they form a band.  \n \n37.20e Killing a dhimmi in a robbery  \n \nA Muslim is put to death for killing a dhimmi in \naggravated robbery or for financial gain.  \n \nA robber is killed if he kills a slave in this manner before \nrepenting. If he repents after he has killed, then he owes the blood \nmoney for a dhimmi and the price of the slave and is not killed for \nthem. \n \nIV THE HUDUD  \n \n37.21 Illicit sex [zina] by a someone who is muhsan  \n \nIllicit sex [zina] is the deliberate intercourse of a Muslim who is \nlegally responsibility with a human being with him he or she has \nno legal right [by marriage or ownership]. It is forbidden as \nindicated by the Book, the Sunnah and consensus.  \n \n[Hashiyya: There must be two, and one of them must be a male. \nChildren and the insane are excluded from responsibility for the \naction, and that is not legal zina in respect of them. For legal zina, \nit must be a Muslim. The intercourse of an unbeliever with \nanother unbeliever is not called legal zina and is not subject to the \nhadd. If an unbeliever has illicit sex with a Muslim woman, he \ndoes not receive the hadd, but is severely punished, and she is \nsubject to the hadd. For it to constitute legal zina, it must involve \npenetration of human private parts by the penis. \"Deliberate\" \nintercourse excludes the one who does so in error or in ignorance \nof the prohibition - as when a new Muslim does that not knowing \nthat it is forbidden.  \n \nProof of its illegality in the Book is, \"And do not go near to \nfornication. It is an indecent act, an evil way.\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:32) \nIn the Sunnah, we find that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"One of the greatest wrong actions is that you make \nsomething equal with Allah azza wa jall when He created You. \nThen that you kill your child fearing he will eat with you. Then \nthat you commit adultery with your neighbor‟s wife.\" There is no \ndisagreement in the Community that it is forbidden.\"  \n \nThere are three punishments for it: stoning, flogging, and exile \nafter flogging. He starts with the first.  \n \n37.21a Stoning  \n \nIf someone commits illicit sex and is a free muhsan, he is \nstoned to death.  \n \nThis is a free legally responsible Muslim, male or female. He is \nstoned with medium sized stones, not large ones to avoid \ndisfigurement or small to avoid torture. People should avoid \nhitting the face and private parts and throw them at the back or \nabdomen.  \n \n[Hashiyya: According to the School, no pit is dug for this.]  \n \n37.21b Who is considered to be \"muhsan\"  \n \nOne acquires the status of being muhsan by marrying a \nwoman in a valid marriage and having valid intercourse \nwith her.  \n \nIhsan linguistically means chastity. In the Shari‟ah it is when a \nsane adult male marries a Muslim or Kitabi woman, free or slave, \nwho is adult or not adult but at an age when sexual intercourse is \npossible, in a valid marriage – the invalid marriage does not count \n- and has permitted intercourse with her. If he has intercourse \nwith her while she is having her period, this does not create ihsan.  \n \n37.22 The punishment for illicit intercourse by a non-\nmuhsan  \n \n37.22a The punishment  \n \nIf he is not muhsan, he receives a hundred lashes and \nexiled to another town by the ruler and kept there for a \nyear.  \n \nAnd he is free Muslim and responsible. Exile is the distance about \nthree days. If he returns before the year, he sent back there or to \nanother place of a similar distance.  \n \nThe prisoner pays for the transport there if he has money. \nOtherwise the treasury pays.  \n \n37.22b Slaves and illicit sex  \n \nA slave who commits fornication receives fifty lashes, as \ndoes a slavegirl, even if they are married. They are not \nexiled nor is a woman exiled.  \n \nThe text comes on the slavegirl. Allah azza wa jall says, \"If they \ncommit fornication, they should receive half the punishment of free \nwomen.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:25) Slaves are by analogy with her. It \ndoes not matter that they are married, because freedom is one of \nthe preconditions of being ihsan and so there is a difference.  \n \nA slave is not exiled because that would cause harm to his master. \nA woman is not exiled because she needs to be guarded and \nprotected. Exile would expose her to shame and the occurrence of \nthe like of that for which she was exiled.  \n \n37.23 Conviction for illicit sex [zina]  \n \n37.23a Establishment of guilt  \n \nThe hadd for illicit sex is only carried out when proven by \nconfession, clear pregnancy, or the testimony of four free \nmen who are adult and of good character who see the \nactual act, like a kohl stick entering a bottle.  \n \nIf someone confesses to zina, even once, that obliges the prescribed \nhadd. Clear pregnancy is proof when the woman has neither \nhusband nor master. The third form of establishing guilt is the \ntestimony of four free men who must see the act of penetration in \nillicit sex.  \n \n[Hashiyya: In the case of confession, it must be someone whose \nconfession is valid by his being adult, sane and not compelled.  \n \n37.23b Testimony to this must be identical  \n \nThey must testify at the same time, and if one of them does \nnot give the full description, the other three who gave it in \nfull are given the hadd [for slander].  \n \nThey all testify at the same time, and must agree on what they \nsaw of the penetration. If they meet and one saw it after another, \nthat is not enough because it can be different acts. If one does not \ndescribe it in full, as when he says, \"I saw him between her legs \nbut that is all I saw,\" then the other three receive the hadd for \nslander, but not the fourth. He is punished at the discretion of the \nruler, even if it is worse than the hadd.  \n \n37.24 Minors  \n \nA hadd is not inflicted on someone who has not reached \npuberty.  \n \nHe or she is not yet legally responsible, whether he or she is the \nactive or passive party. The authorities must, however, discipline \nhim in order to rectify his state. \n \n37.25 Illicit sex with a slavegirl  \n \n37.25a A son having intercourse with his father's slavegirl \nor vice versa  \n \nThe hadd is carried out on someone who has illicit sex \nwith his father's slavegirl but not for someone who has sex \nwith his son's slavegirl. He must, however, pay him her \nvalue, even if she does not become pregnant.  \n \nIt is not carried out on the father because of lack of certainty of \nownership, which is not the case for the son. The estimation of her \nprice is made on the day of intercourse and the son cannot have \nintercourse with her after that. After the father pays her price, he \nmust observe istibra' [a waiting period to ascertain if she is \npregnant] if he wishes to continue having intercourse with her \nunless the son has had intercourse with her. Then she becomes \nharam for both, but he still must pay the price to his son because \nhe has destroyed her for him.  \n \n37.25b A partner having intercourse with a jointly owned \nslave  \n \nA partner in a jointly owned slavegirl is punished if he has \nsex with her and is liable for her price if he has money. If \nshe does not conceive, the other partner can choose \nbetween keeping her or being reimbursed for her value.  \n \nThis is true even if the partner gives him permission to have \nintercourse with her because that is not permitted by the simple \npermission of the partner when he is still a partner. He must be \ndisciplined, but less than the hadd since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Avert the hudud on account of doubts.\" He \nowes her price if she becomes pregnant and then the partner \ncannot keep his share in her and continue the partnership because \nof the establishment of the respect for birth, and she becomes his \numm walad. He owes no price for her intercourse because he is \nlike someone having intercourse with his property. If she does not \nbecome pregnant, the partner can choose to keep his share. He \ndoes not pay any fee or bride price nor her depreciation. If the one \nwho did this is wealthy, his partner can take his share from him. \nIf he is not, then he is in debt for the price according to what they \nagree on, immediate or delayed.  \n \n37.26 A raped woman's proof of innocence  \n \nIf a pregnant woman says that she was forced, she is not \nbelieved and receives the hadd unless there is a witness \nthat she was carried off until the abductor disappeared \nwith her or she comes seeking help at the time of the event \nor comes bleeding.  \n \nA free woman with no husband. The is not believed because the \nbasic principle is that sex is normally voluntary and so that is \nassumed to be the case unless compulsion is established and \nbecause believing her is a means to a lot of illicit sex, given \nwomen's inclination to sex, whether she is someone who can be \nforced or not. She must produce evidence of her truthfulness.  \n \nThere are three ways of establishing her truthfulness. The first is \na reputable witness to her abduction.  \n \nIt is said that one witness is adequate because it is a report, and a \nreport is sufficient to bring about a doubt which cancels the hadd.  \n \nThe second is when she calls out for help during the event. The \nthird is when comes in a state which indicates her truthfulness, \neven if she did not cry out in the event. That cancels the hadd.   \n \n\"Bleeding\" refers to a virgin. In the same of a woman who is not a \nvirgin, some physical evidence of violence is required.  \n \n37.27 A Kitabi rapist  \n \nIf a Christian rapes a Muslim woman he is killed.  \n \nOr a Jew. When the rape is proven by four witnesses because this \naction violates their contract. When one of them breaks the \ncontract, he is killed.  \n \nIf he rapes a Kitabi woman married to a Muslim, there are two \npositions about whether he is executed. If he marries a free \nMuslim woman and she does not know that he is a dhimmi, she \nreceives no hadd and there is disagreement about killing him. If \nshe knows that he is a dhimmi but does not know that it is \nforbidden for her to marry a dhimmi, she receives no hadd. He is \nnot killed, but is punished severely. Four witnesses to the actual \nact are required, and the child has the mother's deen, not that of \nthe father. He must pay the bride-price to her.  \n \n37.28 Voiding conviction based on confession  \n \nIf someone retracts a confession to illicit sex, he is released \nand let go.  \n \nWhether it is based on a doubt or not, during the hadd or before it. \nIf he flees during the hadd, that it is like retraction. Flight in the \nhadd indicates retraction by tasting the punishment. A doubt \nwould be like when he says, \"I had intercourse in an invalid \nmarriage and thought that it was illicit sex.\" He can also say that \nhe was lying in his confession. When the hadd is canceled, the \nbride price of the woman is not canceled when she was forced.   \n \n37.29 The one who carries out the hadd punishment on \nslaves  \n \nA master imposes the hadd punishment for illicit sex on \nhis slave or slavegirl is she becomes pregnant or if there is \nother evidence in the form of four witnesses, or confession. \nBut if the slavegirl has a free husband or her husband is \nthe slave of someone else, the hadd punishment is only \ncarried out on her by the ruler.  \n \nHe also carries out the hadd punishments for slander and \ndrinking, but not the hadd for theft. That has several \npreconditions. The status of a slavegirl married to other than a \nslave of the master is different out of the fear that he might \nmisconstrue their being together. Such a case goes to the ruler \nsince the spouse has a right if he is free and his master if he is a \nslave.  \n \n37.30 Homosexual sodomy  \n \nWhen someone commits the action of the people of Nabi \nLut (alaihi salam) with a consenting adult male, they are \nboth stoned, muhsan or not.  \n \nThe words are general, including free and slave and unbeliever. \nThe action of the people of Lut was anal intercourse between \nmales, whether the male is a slave or not. He excludes the female \nfrom this ruling. A person is not stoned for that, but if she is \nsomeone with whom intercourse is lawful for him, he is punished \nseverely. If she is not lawful for him, he receives the hadd for \nillicit sex. A precondition for stoning the passive partner is that he \nis adult. That is also a precondition for the doer. If they are not \nlegally responsible, then there is only discipline.  \n \n37.31 Slander (qadhf)  \n \nQadhf in technical usage is something which indicates illicit sex or \nsodomy or denial of paternity. It is forbidden by the Book, Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"Those who accuse women who are chaste\" (Holy \nQur‟an 24:23) The Sunnah is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam)  flogged those who delved into the Lie (about 'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu anha)). It has preconditions which concern the \nslanderer and the slandered. He begins with the penalty.  \n \nLinguistically, it means \"to throw stones at\". It is used \nmetaphorically for accusing of disliked things, and it is one of the \nmajor wrong actions.  \n \n37.31a The penalty for slander  \n \nA free person who slanders is given eighty lashes, while a \nslave is given forty lashes for slander and fifty for \nfornication. An unbeliever who slanders also receives \neighty lashes.  \n \nAn adult slanderer, Muslim or unbeliever, even drunk or a father, \nreceives 80 lashes. The slave receives half of that, male or female, \nMuslim or unbeliever. What is required is discrimination. A free \nunbeliever also receives 80 lashes because the ayat is general.  \n \nShaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned from the \nMudawwana that there is no hadd applied on the harbi, and \nShaikh ibn Marzuq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that as well.  \n \n37.31b Slander which is not punished  \n \nThere is no hadd for someone who slanders a slave or \nunbeliever. There is a hadd on account of accusing a girl of \nfornication if she is of an age in which she can have \nintercourse, but there is no hadd on account of slandering \na boy, nor is the punishment carried out on a minor for \nslander or intercourse.  \n \nSlander means to accuse someone of illicit sex. A person is not \nflogged for slandering a boy because there is no shame connected \nto him whereas there is for the girl. A child is not punished \nbecause his deeds are not recorded.  \n \nIf he slanders a slave or unbeliever, he is punished, but not with \nthe hadd, according to at-Tahqiq.  \n \n37.31c \nImpugning \nsomeone's \npaternity \nor \naccusing \nsomeone of sodomy  \n \nA hadd for slander is imposed on someone who denies a \nman's parentage or implies that. If someone calls a man a \nsodomite, he also receives the hadd.  \n \nThis is about a free Muslim man or woman. It is the same if those \nslandered are children or mad. It applies if someone attacks a \nperson's lineage, however high. An example of that is saying, \"You \nare not the child of so-and-so.\" He receives the hadd because the \nsuggestion that a man is a bastard is worse than accusing him of \nillicit sex because the shame of illicit sex is removed by repentance \nwhile the shame of being a bastard is never removed. This also \napplies to implication as when he says to a person, \"I am not a \nfornicator,\" meaning that the one he is speaking to is. Expressions \ncan imply their opposite.  \n \nAccusing someone of sodomy also carries the hadd because he \nascribes to him to a foul action whose doer is subject to the hadd.  \n \n37.32 Multiple infractions  \n \n37.32a The penalty for slandering a group  \n \nIf someone slanders a group, then one of the group may \noblige the hadd once, and then the rest have nothing from \nhim.  \n \nThis when it is done in one statement. The hadd in slander is for \nthe sake of removing shame from the slanderer and denying the \nslander. When the slanderer receives the hadd, then the shame is \nremoved and the desired goal of the Shari‟ah achieved and there is \nno need to repeat the hadd.  \n \n37.32b The death penalty takes precedence  \n \nIf someone drinks wine or fornicates more than once, there \nis one hadd for all of that. It is the same with slandering a \ngroup of people. As for someone who has both hudud \npunishments and killing obliged on him, killing him is \nsufficient in that – except in the case of slander. He \nreceives the hadd for that before he is killed.  \n \nThere is one hadd for multiple infractions because the genus is \none, and one hadd satisfies several of the same infraction. The \nsame principle applies to slandering a group of people.  \n \nIf someone is obliged to receive hudud punishment and execution, \nlike someone who fornicates, drinks wine, steals and kills a \nMuslim, the execution satisfies all of that and no hadd is carried \nout on him except for slander. The hadd must be imposed to \nremove the shame from the slandered.  \n \n37.33 Drinking wine  \n \nIf someone drinks wine or intoxicating nabidh, he receives \na hadd of 80 lashes, whether he is intoxicated or not, but \nhe is not imprisoned for that.  \n \nWine includes all that has been fermented from grapes so that it \ncauses intoxication. Nabidh results from soaking dates or raisins \nin water.  \n \nThe punishment is administered to free responsible Muslims out \nof free choice without being compelled, even if the person is \nignorant of the hadd or the prohibition. Khamr is made from \npressed grape juice. It must be swallowed. The hadd is not \nadministered to dhimmis or harbis. The evils resulting from \ndrinking are worse since that can lead to committing other crimes.  \n \nThe punishment is eighty lashes once he is sober again if that is \nestablished by confession of the testimony of two witnesses who \nsaw him use it or smelled it. There is a disagreement about \nwhether there is a hadd for nabidh which does not intoxicate. He \nis not imprisoned even if he does it a lot because it is not reported \nfrom the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) nor from any of the \nCompanions that they imprisoned for that.  \n \n37.34 Administration of the hadd  \n \nThe one who receives a hadd is stripped, but a woman is \nonly divested of what would protect her from the blows. \nThey receive the flogging sitting down. A pregnant woman \nis not flogged until she gives birth, nor is a very sick \nperson until he recovers.  \n \nA male is stripped of everything except what covers the private \nparts. A woman is stripped of things like a fur because the goal is \nrestraint from the like of what was committed, and it is supposed \nthat the pain of the beating will be a deterrent to the wrongdoer. \nIt is recommended that she be put in a basket and some earth \nunder her and moistened with water for the sake of covering.  \n \nIn flogging, it is the back and shoulders which are hit.  \n \nA pregnant woman is not beaten until she gives birth and finds \nsomeone to care for the child, based on the hadith of Ghamidiyya \nwoman who came to the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) while \npregnant and said, \"Purify me.\" He told her, \"Go away until you \ngive birth.\" A very sick person is not flogged until he recovers out \nof fear of causing death.\"  \n \n37.35 Bestiality  \n \nSomeone guilty of bestiality is not killed, but is punished.  \n \nShaikh ibn Najis (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he is punished \nsince it is possible that one might understand that he has the \nhadd of a virgin. but that is not the case. \"He is punished\" \nindicates that what is meant is that he does not receive any hadd. \nHe is punished as the ruler sees fit since he has done something \nforbidden.  \n \nHashiyya: This is based on the hadith of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) \"Whoever comes to an animal, receives no hadd.\" \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related it. That is the \naction of the people of knowledge and the transmission that he \nand the animal are killed is not established.  \n \n37.36 The hadd for stealing  \n \n37.36a The penalty for theft  \n \nIf someone steals a fourth of a dinar of gold or the \nequivalent of goods worth three dirhams or the weight of \nthree dirhams in silver on the day of the theft, his hand is \ncut off if he stole that from a protected place. His hand is \nnot cut off if he snatches them.  \n \nThis penalty is for men and women, free and slave, Muslim or \nothers. The position of the school is that the value of the object is \ncalculated on the day of the theft, not the day of the judgment. \nThe dirhams are pure silver and one does not any attention to \nwhether they are equivalent to a fourth of a dinar.  \n \nThis is when there are dirhams in circulation in the land where \nthe theft occurred.  \n \nThe basis for this is what is in the Sahih collection where the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The hand of a theft is only \ncut off for a quarter of a dinar or more.\" In the Muwatta' it is \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \nhand of a thief is cut off for a shield worth 3 dirhams.\"  \n \nThe thief must also be adult and sane and not own the stolen \nobject. Also excluded is a mother or father stealing the child's \nproperty. If someone is forced to take part in a theft, his hand is \nnot cut off. This would be like the case of someone who is starving.  \n \nIt must be stolen from a protected place, which is in a place in \nwhich is normally put for safety. That varies according to \nindividuals and property. Some places are secure for one person \nbut not for another, or are secure for some goods rather than \nothers.  \n \nThe hand is not cut off for snatching, which is when he takes \nsomething openly in when someone is inattentive.  \n \n37.36b Multiple cases of the same crime  \n \nIn such a case of theft, the hand applies of a man, woman \nor slave is cut off. If the person steals a second time, his \nleft foot is cut off. If he steals a third time, his left hand is \ncut off. If he steals a fourth time, his right foot is cut off. If \nhe then steals again, he is flogged and imprisoned.  \n \nThe amputation takes place at the wrist and at the ankle. If he is \nimprisoned, it is until he repents or dies.  \n \nThe expense of his imprisonment comes from his own property. If \nhe has no property, then from the Muslim treasury.  \n \n37.37 Voiding a conviction based on admission  \n \nIf someone confesses to theft, his hand is cut off. If he \nretracts, he is let go.  \n \nOne confession is enough for this. If he retracts his confession by a \ndoubt or something as when he says, \"I took my deposited \nproperty,\" and he thought that that was theft. A case of no doubt \nis when he says, \"I lied in my confession.\" \n \n37.38 Return of stolen goods  \n \nA thief must return what he stole if he has it. Otherwise, he \nis indebted for that amount.  \n \nHe pays the value. Otherwise he remains liable for it.  \n \n37.39 Mitigating factors  \n \n37.39a The item stolen must be removed from its place of \nkeeping  \n \nIf someone takes something from the place where it is in \nsafe keeping, his hand is not cut off until he actually \nremoves the stolen object from its place of keeping. The \nsame applies to stealing a shroud from a grave.  \n \nThis is whether he removed it himself or threw it outside or \nremoved it on the back of his animal or a group lift it on the head \nor back of one of them and he takes it out while they remain in the \nsecure place or they go out with him. For all of that there is \namputation. When it has not been taken out of the secure place or \nit is destroyed in it and then removed, there is no amputation. \nThere is no amputation for someone who steals a shroud until he \ntakes it from the grave if it is worth a fourth of a dinar or more.  \n \n37.39b Stealing from a house one is permitted to enter  \n \nIf someone steals from a house he has permission to enter, \nhis hand is not cut off. The hand of someone who snatches \nis not cut off.  \n \nThat is because he is not a thief. He is treacherous. The \ntreacherous one does not have his hand cut off. The basis is what \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related: the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Neither a looter, \ntreacherous person or snatcher has their hand cut off.\" A looter is \nthe one who takes property openly with strength and force. The \ntreacherous person and snatcher do not have their hands cut off. \nThis point is repeated.  \n \nHashiyya: If a spouse steals from the other spouse from a place \nhe or she is forbidden to enter, their hand is cut off. If it is from a \nplace he or she is not forbidden to enter, it is not cut off. This is \nnot just a verbal prohibition, but the place has to be locked.  \n \n37.39c A slave's confession  \n \nIf a slave confesses to something which obliges a hadd or \namputation on his body, his confession is binding. In that \nwhich concerns his person, he cannot confess.  \n \nThis is when admits to a crime for which the hadd is amputation, \nlike drinking, slander or illicit sex, i.e. for any matter which \nobliges punishment on his body, that is obliged by his confession, \neven if his master denies it, as is in at-Tata'i because he is not \nsuspected of wanting to cause this to himself.  \n \nIf he admits to what would oblige to his being taken possession of, \nas when he admits to cutting off the hand of a free person, that is \nnot accepted from him because he is suspected of wanting to be \ntransferred.  \n \n37.39d That for which there is no amputation  \n \nThere is no amputation for taking fruit hanging on a tree, \na palm pith, or for taking grazing sheep or goats unless he \nstole them from their pens, nor for taking fruit unless it is \nfrom a barn.  \n \nThe same applies to fruit hanging in gardens. As for fruit hanging \nin houses or rooms, there is amputation for that. When palm piths \nare is on the tree, there is no amputation for them. There is no \nhadd for sheep or goats which are grazing, whether or not there is \na shepherd with them unless they are taken from the pens where \nthey go after grazing. The same principle applies to fruits in the \nbarn wherever it is located.  \n \n37.40 Intercession  \n \n37.40a Once the crime is reported to the ruler, there is no \nintercession  \n \nThere is no intercession once a case of theft or illicit sex \nhas reached the ruler.  \n \nThe same applies to drinking wine. Once the case reaches the \nruler, then it is the right of Allah azza wa jall and the ruler cannot \npardon nor can he be asked to pardon, even if the fornicator or \nthief repents. The lack of permission to pardon is derived from the \nhadiths about Ma'iz and the Ghamidiyya woman.  \n \nMa'iz ibn Malik confessed four times to illicit sex. The Ghamidiyya \nwoman came to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nasked to be purified of the sin of illicit sex. They were both stoned.  \n \n37.40b Slander is an exception to this  \n \nThere is disagreement about that in case of slander.  \n \nImam  Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi)said that it is permitted based \non the fact that the hadd for slander is a right for the slandered. \nAnother time he said that it is not permitted based on its being a \nright of Allah azza wa jall. It is permitted to intercede before it \nreaches the ruler. \n \n37.41 Pick pocketing and stealing public property  \n \n37.41a There is amputation for pick pocketing  \n \nIf someone steals from someone's sleeve, his hand is cut off. \nIf someone steals from the granary or treasury or booty, \nhis hand is cut off.  \n \nPick pocketing applies to stealing from a sleeve, pocket, turban or \nbelt. The thief's hand is cut off because that is protected place. The \ngranary is the place where the ruler puts the food and goods and \nthe treasury is repository for money. Stealing from the booty is \nafter it has been set aside. The hand is cut off for any such theft.  \n \n37.41b A possible exception  \n \nIt is said that that if what he took is three dirhams more \nthan his share of the booty then his hand is cut off.  \n \nThat is when he exceeds his right by that amount.  \n \nThat is the position of Shaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nwhile the first position is that of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n37.42 Prosecution for stolen goods  \n \nWhen a thief has his hand cut off, he is prosecuted for the \nvalue of missing stolen goods if he is solvent. If he has no \nproperty, he is not prosecuted. He is, however, prosecuted \nfor an amount which does not reach the level at which the \nhand is cut off.  \n \nIts value is taken from him. If he still has the stolen property, it is \ntaken from him after his hand is cut off because amputation is not \ncompensation for it. If the thief is insolvent, it satisfies the time \nbetween his theft and amputation and it is canceled for him so \nthat he does receive two punishments. He is prosecuted for petty \ntheft which is below the nisab for amputation.  \n \n \nChapter 38. Judgments and Testimony \n \n \nQada' [plural aqdiya] is used for judgments, finishing, destruction \nperformance, sending, carrying out, going, and determination, \nTechnically, as Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, it is \nreporting about a legal ruling in a binding way. It is one of the \nfard kifayas, i.e., there must be a number who undertake it since \nit contains necessary public welfare. It can become an individual \nobligation, as when there is one man who fulfills its preconditions \nand it is feared that rights will be lost for their people if he does \nnot undertake judgment. It can be forbidden, when someone is \nignorant and aiming for this world by it or tyrannical. Judgment \nwith justice is one of the best pious actions and injustice in \njudgments is one of the greatest wrong actions and greatest sins. \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"The degenerates will be firewood for \nHellfire.\" (Holy Qur‟an 72:15) The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"The most arrogant of people to Allah and the most \nhated of people by Allah and the furthest of people from Allah is a \nman whom Allah appoints over anything in the Community of \nMuhammad in anything and is not just to them.\"  \n \nBeing is a qadi is a test for the one who undertakes it. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Whoever is made a qadi has \nbeen slaughtered without a knife.\" It has certain preconditions: \nbeing Muslim, sane, free, male, adult, equitable, intelligent and \ncapable of ijtihad.  \n \nOne of its preconditions is ijtihad. It is not sound to appoint an \nimitator when there is a mujtahid available.  \n \nIt is permitted when there is no mujtahid. He must act according \nto the well-known position in the school of his Imam. Know that \nhe means an absolute mujtahid. A lesser mujtahid is in the \nposition of an imitator. There are two categories: a mujtahid of the \nschool, who can establish the proofs, and a mujtahid in fatwa, who \ncan exercise preference.  \n \nHe begins the topic with the sound hadith.  \n \n38.1 Court procedure  \n \n38.1a The onus is on the claimant  \n \nThe plaintiff must produce testimony and the one who \ndenies it takes an oath.  \n \nOne of the shaikhs said that the claimant is the one who says that \nsomething is true and the defendant is the one who says it is not. \nThe claimant must produce evidence because he is someone who \nseeks to establish something. The oath is taken by the one who \ndenies it because he has the stronger side since he claims the \nbasis and the basis is lack of liability.  \n \n38.1b No oaths unless the case is plausible  \n \nThere is no oath taken unless it is established that they \nhave had dealings or that is suspected. That was the \npractice of the judges of the people of Madina. 'Umar ibn \n'Abdu'l-'Aziz (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"People have new \ncases according to the extent that they have new iniquity.\"  \n \nDealings are established by the admission of the claimant or by \nthe testimony of two just witnesses or one witness and the oath of \nthe claimant. \"Suspicion\" is in respect of the theft and usurper. \n\"Dealings\" is in business and probability of suspicion is in \nunlawful appropriation or use of property.  \n \nHash.: The Mukhtasar says that \"dealings\" are established by a \nwoman's evidence.  \n \nThe people of Madina agreed on the evidence, and it is singled out \nby the hadith where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"The claimant produces evidence and the oath is for the one who \ndenies it.\" The literal meaning of the hadith is that the oath is \ngenerally directed, but it is specific requirement that there were \ndealings between them. That is because there are modern cases \naccording to what people devise of new forms of iniquity which is \nstressed by what 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid. Cases are decided according to ijtihad in that in which there \nis no text. There is no doubt that 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) was one of the Imams who are imitated in \nword and deed. This is not contradicted by his words, \"Leave what \nthe moderns innovate\" because that is not based on the Book, \nSunnah or consensus.  \n \n38.1c When the defendant refuses to swear  \n \nIf the defendant refuses to take the oath, judgment is not \ngiven to the claimant until he swears an oath to what he \nclaims to the best of his knowledge.  \n \nWhen he says \"I will not swear\", for instance. The claimant does \nnot receive his claim simply by the refusal of the defendant to \nswear. The claimant must swear to what he knows of the \ndescription of what he claims and its amount. This is for a claim of \nidentification. As for an accusation, as when he suspects a person \nof stealing property, the claimant does not swear, but the \ndefendant must pay when he refuses to swear. The oath is only \ntaken by the claimant in a claim of identification.  \n \n38.1d The form of the oath  \n \nThe oath is \"By Allah, there is no god but Him.\" [Billahi \nalladhi la ilaha illa huwa]  \n \nThis is the oath for all rights. Nothing is added or taken form this \nform. This is general to all people, Muslims and Kitabis. It is said \nthat the Kitabi only says, \"By Allah.\"   \n \nThe later is the apparent position of the Mudawwana.  \n \n38.1e Where the oath is taken  \n \nHe takes the oath standing by the minbar of the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) if it concerns something worth a \nquarter of a dinar or more. Outside of Madina, he takes the \noath in the central mosque at the most esteemed place in \nit. The unbeliever swears \"By Allah\" in a place he respects.  \n \nHe takes the oath standing to make it harsh. If he swears seated, \nthat is not adequate. This is what is relied on it. The oath in \nMadina is taken at the minbar to deter the one who takes the \noath. Other places, it is the Jumu'a mosque, and at the mihrab. If \nhe refuses to swear there, he is considered as refusing to swear.  \n \nThe Kitabi swears in a place he respects. For a Jew, he would \nswear in the synagogue and a Christian in the Church and a \nMagian in his temple.  \n \n38.1f Later evidence  \n \nWhen the claimant finds evidence which he did not know \nbefore after the defendant has taken an oath, judgment \ncan be given in his favor by it. If he knew of it before, it is \nnot accepted. There is also a view that it is accepted. \n  \nWhether the evidence was absent or present, if it is close to the \ntime, like about the length of a week. Shaikh ibn al-Majishun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that judgment is given in his favor after \nhe swears an oath that he did not know. If he knew about it and it \nwas present, then the evidence is not accepted in the well-known \nposition. Shaikh ibn al-Qassar (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is \naccepted.  \n \nHash: He moves on to discuss testimony which is a fard kifayah. \nIf there is only one person capable to giving testimony, then it is \nan individual obligation. If he then refuses to testify in such a \ncase, he is disobedient and can be dealt with by beating and \nimprisonment. Testimony has different ranks. The first is \ntestimony in the case of illicit sex and sodomy. The second rank is \ndealt with here.  \n \n38.1g One witness and an oath in property cases  \n \nJudgment can be given on the basis of a single witness and \noath in the case of property,  \n \nAnd that which leads to property, as when one of them claims that \nhe has an option to withdraw in a sale and the other that the sale \nwas final. The statement accepted is that of the one who says it \nwas final and the one who claims there is an option must bring a \nwitness and take an oath. It similar to hire, accidental wounds \nand recording.  \n \n38.1h Not for other cases  \n \nbut one witness and an oath is not accepted in the case of \nmarriage, divorce, and hudud punishments,  \n \nThis is the third rank.  \n \nTwo witnesses are required in marriage, divorce and the hudud. It \nstates in al-Mudawwana that if someone claims he has married a \nwoman and she denies it, he cannot take an oath to it, even if he \nproduces a witness. Marriage is only established by two witnesses. \nAn example of that in divorce is when the woman claims that her \nhusband divorced her and she has one witness. She does not swear \nan oath with him and the divorce is not obliged. An example of \nthat in the hudud is that one man states that another man has \nslandered him and produces one witness. He does not swear with \nhim and there is no hadd.  \n \n38.1i Not in homicide or deliberate wounding  \n \nnor is one witness and an oath accepted in deliberate \nwounding or homicide. Homicide is only decided by the \nqasama process. There is another view that wounds can be \ndecided on that basis.  \n \nAs when he claims that someone else has deliberately injured him \nand has only one witness. He does not swear with him. The oath is \noffered to the accused. If he swears, he is free. If he refuses, he is \nimprisoned. If he remains for a long time, he is indebted and \nremoved. This does not mean that one judges in homicide by a \nwitness and an oath along is with the qasama about the life.  \n \nIt is also said that judgment can be made about injuries by one \nwitness and an oath in general, whether deliberate or accidental. \nHe presents this and it is well-known while putting the other first \nwhich is not well-known.  \n \nThe view about accidental wounding being decided by one witness \nand an oath is because it leads to property in the form of the blood \nmoney.  \n \n38.2 Women's testimony  \n \n38.2a Their testimony regarding property  \n \nThe testimony of women is only permitted in respect of \nproperty.  \n \nAnd what is connected to property, like hire.  \n \n38.2b The weight of a woman's testimony  \n \nA hundred women count as two women. Two women count \nas one man. Judgment is given on the basis of that with \none man or an oath in cases where one witness and an oath \nare permitted.  \n \nThat is like one man, since the rule that it is possible with an oath \nwhen in such cases.  \n \n38.2c Cases where women's testimony is accepted  \n \nThe testimony of two women alone is accepted in matters \nwhich men do not observe, such as childbirth, the crying of \na new-born child and the like.  \n \nThis is the fourth rank of testimony. Their testimony is accepted \nin what men do not witness, like birth and the cry of a new-born. \nThe fact that he cries means that he was born alive and then he \ninherits and is inherited from. The like of that are things like \ndefects of the vagina and body. This does not contradict what he \nsaid about the testimony of women only being accepted in property \nbecause that is particular to what we defined of his words.  \n \n38.3 \nRejecting \na \nwitness \nbecause \nof \ncharacter \nor \nrelationship  \n \n38.3a Rejection of testimony  \n \nNeither the testimony of an adversary nor someone who is \nsuspect is not allowed.  \n \nThis is the testimony of an opponent against his opponent. \nSomeone suspect is suspect in his deen because of committing \nsomething not permitted in the Shari‟ah. It is also said that his \ntestimony is suspect.  \n \nHashiyya: This is an opponent for material gain which is not \ninsignificant. It is permitted if it is about something insignificant \nor it is a difference in the deen, as a Muslim testifying against an \nunbeliever. It, however, there is a long-standing feud, it is not \naccepted. As the evidence of an adversary is not accepted, it is not \naccepted against the mother, father or son of his adversary, nor is \nhis son's testimony accepted. Someone's testimony itself being \nsuspect is when he is suspected of bias in his testimony.  \n \n38.3b Acceptable witnesses  \n \nOne only accepts the testimony of reputable witnesses.  \n \nBeing reputable ['adala] is not that a man is investigated for \nobedience so that no act of disobedience sullies it because that is \nimpossible and only the true are capable of it. What is meant is he \nusually is obedient to Allah azza wa jall and avoids wrong actions.  \n \nSomeone who is 'adl is free, Muslim, sane, adult, free of iniquity, \ndebarment due to foolishness, and free of innovation. Innovation \nincludes \nMu'tazilites \nand \nKharijites. \nShaikh \nal-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"In our view, 'adala is Allah azza wa \njall's right from the judge. He is only permitted to give judgment \nwith reputable witnesses. Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"Since it is Allah azza wa jall's right, even if the litigants \nagree to accept the testimony of an unbeliever or one with whom \nAllah azza wa jall is angry, the judge is not permitted to give \njudgment on that basis.\" Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that.  \n \n38.3c Those who have been punished for a hadd are not \nacceptable as witnesses  \n \nOne does not accept the testimony of someone who has \nbeen given a hadd punishment nor the testimony of a \nslave, child, or unbeliever. If someone who has received \nthe hadd for illicit sex repents, then his testimony may be \naccepted except in cases involving illicit sex.  \n \nThis is when someone has not repented. If he repents, there is a \ntext on that.  \nA slave's testimony while still a slave is not permitted because \ntestimony is one of the ranks of the Shari‟ah which obliges rights \nagainst another and a slave is not worthy of it. The limitation is \nonly while he is a slave. He can testify once he is free.  \n \nThe testimony of a child is not accepted although it can be \naccepted against another child.  \n \nThe testimony of an unbeliever is not acceptable either against a \nMuslim or an unbeliever. If he was an unbeliever and becomes \nMuslim, his testimony is accepted in what does not refer to the \ntime he was an unbeliever. It is not accepted after his Islam \nbecause he is suspected of removing the imperfection which his \ntestimony rejects because of it is natural human natural to seek to \nremove shame.  \n \nIf someone repents of illicit sex, his testimony is not accepted in \nillicit sex. It is only accepted in other cases than for which he \nreceived a hadd. This is general, even if he became the best person \nafter his repentance.  \n \n38.3d Kinship bars testimony  \n \nIt is not permitted for a son to testify in favor of his \nparents or vice versa, nor a husband to testify in favor of \nhis wife or vice versa. It is permitted for a man of good \ncharacter to testify in favor of his brother.  \n \nThe point is that the branch does not testify to its root nor the root \nto its branch. As for the testimony of the branch for the branch of \nthe root or the reverse, that is permitted as is the testimony of one \nof the parents for one of the sons against another son if there is no \nbias for the one in whose favor the testimony is given. Otherwise \nit is forbidden, as when a parent testifies for his pious son against \nthe impious. A spouse cannot testify for the other spouse while \nthey are married or in a revocable divorce. The same does not \napply once they are divorced.  \n \nThe point about root and branches is that the principle extends \nupwards to grandparents and downwards to grandchildren.  \n \nIt is permitted for a brother in favor of his brother, but only in \ncases of property and injuries which entail property, not that \nwhich would bring his brother honor or rank, like testifying that \nhe married in such a way that would bring him honor or rank.  \n \n38.3e Others whose testimony is inadmissible  \n \nOne does not allow the testimony of a habitual liar, \nsomeone who openly commits a major wrong action, \nsomeone seeking his own self-interest or seeking to avert \nharm from himself, or a guardian in favor of his orphan. A \nguardian may, however testify against his ward.  \n \nHash: A habitual liar lies time and time again. A single lie has no \neffect. This is also unlawful lying. As for permitted lying, as when \nit is done in an effort to make peace between two people with a \nfeud, that does not detract from his character.  \n \nSomeone who openly commits a major wrong action or commits a \nsmall of minor action which involves baseness like stealing a \nmorsel or stinginess about a grain in the measure. As for the \nminor wrong actions which do not indicate baseness, like looking \nat a woman, that does not detract unless that is habitual.  \n \nIt is not permitted for someone to testify for his own benefit, as \nwhen someone testifies for his partner about something regarding \nshared property, as when one of the partners claims money from a \nman and that money which he claims is part of the property of the \npartnership. His partner cannot testify for him because it would \nbring him benefit. Averting harm is like when a man owes a debt \nto another and another man claims a debt and this one testifies \nthat he paid his debt. He is suspected of defending himself in the \nquarrel between him and the other claimant, so he will say, \"I will \ndivide the property of the debtor with you,\" or \"I will have it alone \nand you have no debt.\"  \n \nThe same applies to a guardian because this is part of bringing \nabout self-interest by his testimony. The point is repeated because \nhe can testify against him. The expression in the Mudawwana is \nthat if someone cannot testify in favor someone, is permitted to \ntestify against him. \n \n38.4 Testifying to the character of a witness  \n \n38.4a Such testimonial is not permitted from women  \n \nIt is not permitted for women to testify to the good or bad \ncharacter of a witness.  \n \nNeither about men or women. Their testimonial is not accepted in \neither case.  \n \n38.4b Form of testimonial about character  \n \nDeclaring someone to have good character [tazkiya] is only \naccepted when someone says, \"He is reputable and pleasing \n['adlun rida].\" A single witness to the character or bad \ncharacter of a witness is not accepted.  \n \nJustice is a firm form in the self which is compelled to have \nconstant taqwa. One witness is not accepted outwardly.   \n \nHash: Reputability is in action and pleasing means for testifying. \nIt is said that reputability it between a person and people, and \nbeing pleasing is between him and Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n38.5 Testimony of minors  \n \nThe testimony of minors may be accepted on wounds \nbefore they have dispersed and no adult has been with \nthem.  \n \nThis is about what happens among them. Their testimony is also \naccepted in killing in the famous position as well as in wounds, \nbut only before they separate, out of the fear that they might be \ncoached by an adult.  \n \nHashiyya: There are further preconditions. They must be male, \nfree and Muslim. Two or more of them must testify and they must \nhave the same testimony. The one who gives evidence must not be \na relative of the one in whose favor he testifies nor an enemy of \nthe one he testifies against. They must have discrimination about \nthe action. They must have been in the same group. It is also said \nthat the child must be at least around the age of ten.  \n \n38.6 Sale disputes  \n \nWhen two parties to a contract disagree, the seller is asked \nto swear an oath and then the buyer either accepts that or \nswears an oath and is free of the contract.  \n \nThey may disagree about the price as when the seller says that it \nis a dinar and the buyer half a dinar. First the seller swears. The \nSchool obliges that the seller begins with the oath and takes an \noath denying the claim of the buyer and confirming his claim in \nthe same oath. He says, \"By Allah, I did not sell it for half a dinar, \nI sold it for a dinar.\" Then the buyer can take the goods for what \nthe seller says, or swear to deny the claim of the seller and affirm \nhis claim. He would say in this example, \"By Allah, I did not buy it \nfor a dinar, I bought it for half a dinar.\" Then he is freed of the \nbinding nature of the sale, and he can choose between taking the \ngoods for what the seller swore or swear and be quit of the \ntransaction.  \n \n38.7  Ownership disputes  \n \n38.7a Contention over ownership  \n \nWhen two claimants disagree about something in their \npossession, they swear oath and then the disputed \nproperty is divided between them.  \n \nThis is when each of them claims ownership and neither has any \nevidence nor proof of his truthfulness and no one else contends \nwith them in it, and it is part of which either of them can acquire. \nIt is shared between them because their claims are equal and one \ncannot be preferred over the other. If one of them refuses to take \nan oath, then his right is canceled in favor of the other.  \n \nIf there are three, it is divided between the three.  \n \n38.7b When there are character witnesses  \n \nIf the two produce witnesses, judgment is given in favor of \nthe one with better character. If the two witnesses are \nequal, then the two parties swear an oath and the property \nis divided between them.  \n \nIf each of them has a witness who testifies for him and one of the \ndominates the other in justice, then judgment is given in favor of \nthe more just after he swears that he did not sell that thing nor \ngive it him nor did it remove from his property by any aspect at \nall. If neither witness is preferred, then the two witnesses must be \nthe same in justice and one does not prefer by number unless it \nreaches the level of mutawatir. They swear and the disputed thing \nis divided between them because it is not more fitting to give \njudgment for one of them than the other. \n \n37.8 Retracted testimony  \n \nWhen a witness retracts after judgment, he is liable for any \nlosses in which his testimony resulted if he admits to \nperjury. The people of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that.  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the apparent \nmeaning of the words demands that all the people of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) differentiated between him admitting that \nhe gave false testimony or not admitting it. In the first, he is liable \nbut not in the second. That is not the case, Shaikh Mutarrif \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Shaikh Asbagh (rahmatullahi alaihi) said in the Wadiha that \nhe is liable absolutely because the error and deliberate regarding \npeople's property is the same.  \n \n38.9 The statement of an agent  \n \n38.9a His statement is accepted  \n \nWhen someone says, \"I have returned to you what you \nentrusted to me to pay\" or \"to sell\" or \"I paid you its price\" \nor \"I have returned your deposit or your loan,\" then his \nstatement is accepted.  \n \nAs when he entrusts him with an amount to repay a debt he owes \nto someone and the agent does not find him and returns it. If the \none who entrusted him contends with him, then one takes the \nword of the agent since he is a trustee. The same applies in cases \nof a deposit.  \n \nIn all these cases the statement accepted is that of the one \nentrusted. It maybe that the author follows what the shaikhs of \nthe Mudawwana said when he makes a statement on it, his word \nmust be accompanied by an oath and so the statement accepted is \nwhen he swears an oath to it.   \n \n38.9b Proof of delivery  \n \nIf someone says, \"I gave it to so-and-so as you commanded,\" \nand that person denies it, then the one who delivered it \nmust produce proof. Otherwise he is liable.  \n \nHe must have evidence that he gave it to him, otherwise he is \nliable for it.  \n \nHashiyya: This is when the custom is to produce witnesses or he \nwas commanded to have witnesses. Then not having witnesses is \nnegligence on his part. If the custom is not to have witnesses, then \nhe is not liable, as this is a case of acting according to custom \n('urf).  \n \n38.10 The statement of a guardian [wali]  \n \nThe same is true in the case of an orphan's guardian. He \nneeds proof about what he spent on them or gave to them. \nIf, however, they are in his direct custody, then he is \nbelieved about their maintenance when it seems probable.  \n \nThis is when the orphans dispute with him about spending and \nclaim that he has not spent on them or they contest the amount he \nhas spent when they were not in his custody as when he spent on \nthem is feasible or well-known, if they are in his care. That is \nbecause of the difficulty of having witnesses in the later case and \nso the onus is lightened.  \n \n38.11 Amicable settlements [sulh]  \n \nAn amicable settlement is permitted unless it leads to the \nunlawful. It is permitted in both affirmation or denial.  \n \nUnless it involves something forbidden in the Shari‟ah, like paying \ngold for silver on a delay. It is permitted in affirming a sale, as \nwhen it is goods or animals and is settled for dirhams, or denial \nwhen he claims a house and the defendant denies it, but satisfies \nhim with something. It is permitted in contracts.  \n \nHashiyya: Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh at-\nTirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) report that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Reconciliation between the Muslims \nis permitted except for a reconciliation which makes the lawful \nunlawful or the unlawful lawful.\" An example of the first is when \nabout a house which is claimed for wine or pigs, and the second is \nexchanging goods for a garment provided that one who takes it \ndoes not wear it or sell it.\"  \n \n38.12 A slavegirl who marries claiming she is free  \n \nIf a deceitful slavegirl marries a man on the basis that she \nis free, her master can reclaim her and claim the value of \nany child on the day of the judgment.  \n \nShe deceives him by her actual words or by giving the appearance \nthat she is free to the one who wants to marry her. The husband \nowes the minimum of what is named and the bride price of a \nwoman like her. The price of the child is paid by the father since \nthe child is not one whom the master has to free. If the master has \nto free him, there is no liability for the deluded husband to pay the \nprice of his child, as when she deludes the son of his grandparent \nand he marries her thinking she is free and then he learns that \nshe is a slave. The child is freed by his grandfather or \ngrandmother.  \n \n38.13 Establishing a claim to a slavegirl  \n \n38.13a The right of the legal owner  \n \nWhen someone establishes his claim to a slavegirl who has \nborne (her new master) a child, he is entitled to her value \nand the value of her child on the day of judgment.  \n \nThe case is when she has borne a child to a free person who did \nnot acquire her illegally, whether by ownership, gift, inheritance, \npurchase or whatever manner of ownership. The real owner is \nentitled to the price of the slavegirl and the price of the child on \nthe day of judgment and the child is free and his lineage \nestablished.   \n \n38.13b Other views  \n \nIt is also said that he takes her and the price of the child, \nand it is also said that he only takes her price, unless he \nchooses to take the price. If he choose to take her price, he \ntakes from the abductor who sold her.  \n \nHe takes her value on the day he had intercourse with her. All \nthree statements are made by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nHe takes the price from the abductor when he chooses the price as \nis confirmed by the sale of the usurper.  \n \n38.13c If the usurper still has her  \n \nIf she is still in the possession of the abductor, then he \nreceives the hadd and the child and its mother are slaves \nof her true owner.  \n \nIf, after birth, the slavegirl to whom someone is legally entitled is \nstill in the unlawful possession of the one who abducted and he \nknows she is not lawfully his, then he receives the hadd because \nhe had illicit sex.  \n \nThe child is a slave since it is without father. It would have been \nbetter to say that the child is ascribed to the lineage of the mother \nbecause it is connected to her and not him.  \n \nThe ruling regarding someone who purchased her from the \nabductor, knowing about his abduction, is the same as that of \nabductor: his lineage is severed when there is evidence that he \nknew before intercourse that she was unlawfully abducted.  \n \n38.14 Establishing a claim to land  \n \n38.14a If land has been build on  \n \nIf someone establishes his claim to land after it is has been \nbuilt on, he should pay the price of the buildings which are \nstanding. If he refuses to do that, the buyer should pay him \nthe price of the undeveloped land.  \n \nIn the case of someone entitled to take land from someone who has \nbought it or someone else who has not unlawfully acquired it after \nthere are buildings, planting and the like on it, he can pay for the \nimprovements and take the land with its structures or the buyer \ncan pay him the value of the empty land.  \n \n38.14b When the owner refuses either course  \n \nIf the buyer refuses, then they become partners in the \nproperty according to the value of which of them owns.  \n \nHash: One version has, \"either of them refuses.\"  \n \nOr when either of them refuses to pay the other. They become \npartners according to the value of each of them. If the land is \nworth ten dinars and the buildings worth twenty, then one owns \ntwo-thirds and the other one-third. One assesses the value on the \nday of the judgment, according to the famous position, not the day \nof construction of the buildings.  \n \n38.14c The case of the usurper  \n \nA usurper, however, is ordered to remove his buildings, \ncrops and trees. If he wishes, their owner can be paid the \nprice of the debris and trees, after deducting the cost of \nhiring someone to remove that. He owes nothing for what \nhas no value after it is uprooted or demolished.  \n \nIt is not permitted for the two of them to agree to have that \nremain in the land in exchange for rent because that would lead to \nselling crops before they are ripe in exchange for letting them \nremain because the owner would be able to take it free of charge \nin the first division or by the value uprooted in this second \ndivision after it is sold to him.  \n \nHash: If the time for planting that land has passed, the owner \ndoes not command him to remove the crop, but he is paid rental \nfor that year.  \n \nThen the trees can be taken as firewood. He is allowed to gives the \nowner the price of its debris and crops. The like of that is that its \nprice uprooted is 10 dirhams and the wage for removing it is four \ndirhams. He can pay him six dirhams. He is not liable for things \nlike engravings, or plants or trees before they are of any use.  \n \n38.15 Increment in usurped goods  \n \n38.15a Any increment must be returned  \n \nSomeone who unlawfully acquired it must return any \nrevenue, but no one except someone who has acquired it \nunlawfully is obliged to return it.  \n \nThis includes the thief, treacherous person, pickpockets and the \nlike and all of those about whose unlawful possession is clear \nwithout any uncertainty. That is also based on the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The property of a Muslim \nperson is only lawful when he is happy about it.\" The non-usurper \nis one with a doubt, even if he bought it from an usurper when he \ndid not know.  \n \nSince the child is not part of the revenue and he fears that it \nmight be included, he continues:  \n \n38.15b Offspring  \n \nIn the case of the offspring of animals and slavegirls, if \nthey have children by other than the (new) master, they \nare taken by the one entitled to the mothers from the \nperson who purchased them or has gained possession of \nthem for some other reason. If someone unlawfully abducts \na slavegirl and has intercourse with her, the child is a \nslave and he receives the hadd punishment.  \n \nOther means would be like someone who was given her as a gift or \nsadaqa because the ruling of the child is that of the mother since \nshe is property of the one to whom she belongs and so the owner \ntakes him. The usurper does not owe the bride-price, but a fine for \nthe lowering of her value due to intercourse.  \n \n38.16 Building Regulations  \n \n38.16a Responsibility of the owner of the ground floor  \n \nThe owner of the ground floor is responsible for \nmaintenance of ground floor as well as for the wood of the \nceiling and the support for the rooms above it when the \nground floor becomes weak and dilapidated until it is \nsound. He is compelled to make the repairs or to sell it to \nsomeone who will repair it.  \n \nThis is when someone owns the rooms above him. If the ground \nfloor becomes weak, it is feared that the house will collapse. The \nowner of the ground floor must make the repairs since he is able \nto do that. He is responsible for the wood of the ceiling and the \nsupports. Since the solidity of the house depends on the occupant \nof the ground floor, he must either repair it or be made to. If it is \nsold to someone else and he refuses to repair it, then must either \nrepair it or sell it to someone who will put it right.  \n \n38.16b Alterations not allowed  \n \n\"There is no harm nor exceeding harm done.\" He must not \ndo anything which will harm his neighbor: like opening a \nwindow facing him by which he can see his neighbor, \nopening a door directly in front of his door, or digging \nanything that will harm his neighbor, even in his own \nproperty.  \n \nThis is a sound hadith. There is no harming the one who does not \nharm you. That is the meaning of \"no harm\". There is no doing to \nhim more than he does you and so exceeding his harm. As for the \nlike of his action or less than it, that is permitted as Allah azza wa \njall says, \"So if anyone oversteps the limits against you, overstep \nagainst him the same as he did to you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:194) This is \nin relation to the common people. As for the great people and the \nelite, they meet evil with correctness.  \n \nIf there already is a window onto the house of the neighbor, he \ndoes not have to block it, but he is forbidden to look at his \nneighbor from it so that the male can be distinguished from male. \nHe does not open a door opposite his neighbor because that would \nentail looking at the private parts of his neighbors. He does not \ndig something which will harm him, even if it is in his own \nproperty, like digging a well next to his wall or his lavatory.  \n \n38.16c Judgment on a wall  \n \nJudgment on the ownership of a wall is given in favor the \none whose house has wooden or masonry joints in the wall.  \n \nQumut means the wood or palm fiber joints put in the middle of a \nwall to keep it from breaking and the masonry joints are stones \nwhich support the structure. The terms are interchangeable.  \n \n38.17 Water Supplies  \n \n38.17a Excess water  \n \nExcess water may not be denied in an effort to prevent \npeople from grazing animals.  \n \nThe form of that is that there is pasture next to water where some \npeople camp, desiring to graze in it and the owners of the water \nprevent them from getting water so that they will leave their \npasture.  \n \n38.17b Use of wells  \n \nPeople with wells for their livestock have the first claim on \nwater for their animals and then the rights of other people \nare the same.  \n \nThe animals of the people who own the wells water their animals \nand then the animals of the travelers can be watered. People are \nequal in the right to the water afterwards.  \n \nWhen the well are not on private land, and there is a conflict \nbetween those who dug the wells and travelers.  \n \n38.17c Springs or wells on private land  \n \nIf someone has a spring or well on his land, he may prevent \nothers from using it unless his neighbor’s well has caved in \nand he has plants he fears he will lose. Then he cannot \ndeny him his excess water. There is disagreement about \nwhether he can take payment for that or not.  \n \nOr if the well dries up. In this case he is obliged to let his neighbor \nuse it with three preconditions. The neighbor has crops which \ndepend on water, his well has collapsed and he fears the crops will \nbe lost and he has begun to repair his well without delay. There is \ndisagreement about whether he can take payment for that. It is \nrelated from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he does, and \nit is stated in the Mudawanna that he does not. The reason is that \nit is an obligation to give the excess of water by way of help, so he \nshould not take payment for it. The reason for the first opinion is \nthat he uses the property of someone else to revive his own \nproperty.  \n \nHash: The relied on position is that he does not take payment.  \n \n38.18 Another building regulation  \n \nSomeone should not refuse to allow his neighbor to insert \nbeams into his wall but he cannot be compelled to accept \nthat.  \n \nThe meaning is that it is recommended. It is confirmed that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"No neighbor should \nprevent his neighbor from inserting a piece of wood in his wall.\" It \nis recommended which is why he says that he cannot be \ncompelled. That indicates the refutation of the position of Shaikh \nibn \nKinana \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nImam \nash-Shafi'i  \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he can be compelled.  \n \nHash: The prohibition is one of dislike.  \n \n38.19 Damage done by animals  \n \nIf livestock ruin crops and gardens during night, the \nowners of the animals are liable for that. They do not owe \nanything for damage done during the day.  \n \nThe details of this are in the Muwatta' and elsewhere. It is related \nfrom the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) that the owners of a \ngarden must guard it in the day, but what animals damage in it at \nnight is the liability of the animals' owners. The place of the \nliability for what the animals destroy at night being that of their \nowner is when there is no shepherd with them. Otherwise it is the \nshepherd who is responsible.  \n \nHash: This is when he lets them loose at night and does not die \nthem up. If he ties them up, he is not liable. It refers to animals \nwhich are normally tended, and not creatures like bees and doves \nfor which they are not liable. When he is liable for damage, he \npays the value or replaces what has been destroyed. \n \n38.20 Bankruptcy claims  \n \nIf someone finds his goods in the possession of someone \nwho has become bankrupt, he can either take his share \n[with the other creditors] or recover his actual property if \nhe can identify the individual item. If, however, the debtor \nhas died, he must take his share with the rest of the \ncreditors.  \n \nIf he finds his goods which he sold to a man which are not lost and \nfor which he has not been paid before the buyer goes bankrupt, \nthen he has this choice. He either shares with the other creditors \nin the property as a whole and takes his share or, if it is \nsomething like an animal or a slave, he can recover it. If it is \nsomething like wheat, he can only take a share. If the bankrupt \nperson has died, and he has not received the price before the buyer \ndies, he is not more entitled to his goods than the other creditors. \nHe must take a share.  \n \n38.21 Guarantee of debts  \n \nThe one who gives a guarantee is liable, and the one who \nguarantees the appearance of the debtor is liable if he does \nnot bring the person unless he stipulated that he would not \nbe liable.  \n \nWhen he is unable to fully satisfy the creditor. If someone who \nguarantees an appearance fails to bring the debtor present at the \ntime he is required to bring him, if is liable for the amount the \ndebtor owes unless he stipulated that that was not binding for him \nto be responsible for the money if the debtor failed to appeared. \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated that if he is able to \nbring him and neglects it, then he is liable.  \n \n38.22 Transfer of Debts [Hawala]  \n \n38.22a A transfer is not revocable  \n \nIf someone agrees to have his debt transferred to a third \nparty, he cannot go back to the first debtor, even if the \nthird party becomes bankrupt, unless the first one \ndeceived him.  \n \nIf he deceives him, that means that he knew that the person to \nwhom it was transferred was insolvent and still transferred it to \nhim. If that is the case, the original debtor is not freed of \nresponsibility and the debt reverts to the first debtor.  \n \n38.22b The transfer  \n \nThe transfer is based on an original debt. Otherwise it is a \nguarantee.  \n \nIf it is not on the basis of a debt, then he is a guarantor, i.e. \nresponsible, because a transfer is transferring the responsibility \nfor a right to the responsibility of another. If there is no basic debt, \nthere is no transfer, even if the term \"transfer\" is used. The point \nof that is that the creditor can go back to the original debtor who \nis not free is liability by that because the guarantee does not \neliminate the responsibility of the one guaranteed. It is another \nliability. If it had been an actual transfer, he would be free of \nresponsibility and the one who transferred it would not be able to \nreturn to him.  \n \n \n38.23 More on the guarantee of debts and bankruptcy  \n \n38.23a When a guarantor must pay the debt  \n \nA guarantor is not liable except in the bankruptcy or the \nabsence of the debtor.  \n \nThis refers to his words that the guarantor is liable. The situation \nin which he is liable is the absence of the debtor when the creditor \nhas not ready money with which he can pay the debt. If he is \nabsent, but not far away, he is considered as present. Then he is \nnot liable.  \n \n38.23b In case of death or bankruptcy  \n \nThe death of the subject or his bankruptcy makes every \ndebt he owes immediately due, but not debts which other \npeople owe to him.  \n \nWhat is meant bankruptcy is when a judge orders the stripping of \nhis property, not just the position of creditors. That which is \ndeferred is not immediately due. As for deferred debts becoming \ndue by death, that is because the debt is attached to blood, and it \nis ended by death and the creditor no longer has a connection to \nliability. Therefore what was deferred becomes due immediately \nand the liability moves to the legacy because it is not connected to \nother than the two. When one is gone, only the other remains.  \n \nAs for its becoming due by bankruptcy, it is because the creditors \nmade their agreement based on full responsibility, and that is \ndestroyed by bankruptcy and so that no longer remains.  \n \nThe debts that others owe him do not become due by his death or \nbankruptcy, because their place, which is the responsibility, still \nexists.  \n \n38.23c A slave with debts is not sold to settle them  \n \nA slave permitted to trade is not sold in order to discharge \nhis debts nor is his master prosecuted for them.  \n \nThe master is only prosecuted if he tells them, \"Employ him\" and \nthey do so.  \n \n38.23d Detaining a debtor whose financial situation is \nunclear  \n \nA debtor may be imprisoned until he is cleared. He is not \nimprisoned if he is known to be insolvent.  \n \nHe is imprisoned until his state is known. When his insolvency is \nconfirmed by the testimony of two just witnesses who testify that \nthey do not know that he has money either public or hidden. Then \nhe is not released until he takes an oath that he has no wealth \neither outward or hidden and his oath is absolute and he does \nobtain property, he will pay his debt, even if he any beyond his \nimmediate needs.  \n \nHash: Someone who is well off and refuses to pay his debts is \nimprisoned and flogged time after time until he pays what he \nowes. That is at the discretion of the judge. \n \nA man is imprisoned with other men and a woman is lodged in the \nprotective custody of a trustworthy woman.  \n \n38.24 Apportionment of jointly owned property  \n \n38.24a Division of property  \n \nBuildings and property which can be divided without \nharm are divided [in case of dispute].  \n \nSuch property includes animals, goods and measured and weighed \nthings. This is when there is a dispute and some of the owners \nwant to divide it and some do not. The one who refuses to do that \nis compelled to do it.  \n \n38.24b Enforced sale  \n \nIn the case of something which cannot be divided without \nharm, if one party wishes to sell it, the other partner can \nbe compelled to sell it.  \n \nThis is something like a single slave. If the object would be \ndestroyed by division or would be harmed by it, like a pair of \nleather socks, when division would destroy its use. If the partners \ncontend about any of that and are not happy about using it jointly, \nand one wants to sell it while the others refuse to do that, they are \ncompelled to sell it because it is not possible to divide it to end the \ndispute. Therefore it must be sold in order to end the dispute.  \n \n38.24c Division by lots  \n \nDivision by lots is only done with the same category of \nthing. None of the partners can be given a price [while the \nother takes the goods]. If they decide to equalize the \nshares, the division is only permitted when they both \nconsent to it.  \n \nIt is not permitted to draw lots when the items consist of two \ncategories and or disparate types, like apples and peaches. Each \ncategory is put on its own so that there no clear uncertainty in the \nlots. There is no paying a price since that would result in the \nexistence of two different categories and lots can only be used in \nthe same category.  \n \nHash: Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) adds that the \nproperty on which lots are drawn is shared property. Each \ncategory is divided on its own. You cannot have one lot consist of \nhouses and the other a garden, for instance. Doing that would \ninvolve uncertainty [gharar].  \n \nAn example of equalization is when there are two garments. One \nis worth two dinars and the other worth one. Lots are drawn for \nthem, and the one who gets the garment worth two dinars gives \nthe other five dirhams to equalize them. That is only permitted \nwith mutual consent as when one says the other, \"You have a \nchoice: either you choose that whose value is two dinars and give \nfive dirhams or you take that whose price in one dinar and take \nfive dirhams.\"  \n \n38.25 Function of an executor [wasi]  \n \n38.25a Appointing an guardian-executor  \n \nA guardian appointed by the original guardian is like the \nguardian. A guardian can trade with the property of \norphans and arrange the marriage of their slavegirls. If an \nuntrustworthy guardian is appointed, he may be removed.  \n \nIf the basis is appointment by the father, not by the Qadi. If he is \nappointed by the qadi, then he cannot appoint someone else. He \ncannot buy his property himself. If he does that, the ruler should \nexamine the sale. If he sees in good in it, he allows it, Otherwise, \nhe cancels it.  \n \nHash: The executor must be Muslim, adult, sane, legally \nresponsible and reputable.  \n \n38.25b The sequence is which the estate is dealt with  \n \nOne begins with the cost of the shroud, then paying debts, \nthen paying bequests and then inheritance.  \n \nAfter specific requirements like the umm walad and woman whose \nemancipation is stipulated at a certain term and the like. Then \ncomes the cost of the shroud and then debts which are firm by \nevidence or admission when he was healthy or ill, but that is when \nthere is no suspicion. Then the bequests are paid and finally the \ninheritance is distributed.  \n \n38.26 Squatter's Rights  \n \nIf someone lives in a house belonging to someone else for \nten years, it then becomes his if the owner was present and \nthen did not claim anything from him. Living in the house \nof a relative or in-law this for this period of time does not \nestablish this for him.  \n \nOr it can be land which is more general. The owner being present \nmeans present and sane, and not a relative or a partner. The \nowner must know about his occupation and his ownership. If he \ndoes not know and says, \"I did not know it was my property while \nthis person had it and I only just found the documentation with \nso-and-so,\" or he is an heir and claims that he did not know that it \nwas his property, his word is accepted.  \n \nHashiyya: Hiyaza, which includes the claim to the right of \npossession. Such claims do not extend to animals and goods.  \n \nThis is when he does not claim anything and nothing prevents \nhim from claiming. If the squatter has a force and he stays, even a \nlong time, the claim is heard. After that time his evidence is not \nheard because custom denies it since he was silent about the claim \nfor this entire time outside of the right of Allah azza wa jall. If it is \nAllah azza wa jall's right, it is not lost by occupation, even for a \nlong time, as when someone occupies the road of the Muslims or a \npart of it or a mosque or a place which is a waqf for someone else.  \n \n38.27 Bequests  \n \n38.26a Debt owed to an heir  \n \nIt is not permitted for a sick person to admit to a debt \nowed to an heir or to state that the heir has paid him a \ndebt he owes him.  \n \nThis is in an illness from which it is feared that he might die. He \ncannot affirm the debt which he owes by simple admission or say \nthat he has been paid a debt as when he says, \"So-and-so is owed \nsuch-and-such\", and the form of its admission of taking it is that \nhe says, \"I took the debt which I am owed.\" This is because there \nis the suspicion that if his heirs consist of his daughter and \nnephew, there is basis for his daughter and so one judges by \nsuspicion and his affirmation of taking it is only because of his \nlove for her.  \n \n38.26b A bequest to perform hajj  \n \nIf someone leaves an instruction in his will that the hajj be \nperformed (on his behalf), his instruction is carried out, \nbut we prefer a bequest of sadaqa.  \n \nThis is paid out of the disposable third. The Malikis prefer sadaqa \nto a bequest for hajj because there is no disagreement about the \ndeceased benefiting from sadaqa whereas there is disagreement \nbetween scholars about whether the deceased benefits from the \nhajj. The position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is \nof no benefit for him.  \n \n38.26b Someone employed to perform hajj  \n \nIf the one hired to make hajj dies before completing it, he \nreceives the fee for the amount he traveled and the rest is \nreturned. What he spent is his liability, unless he took it on \nthe basis that he would be paid on completing it. Then the \nliability is that of those who hired him. If anything is left it \nis returned.  \n \nThis is when he dies on the way to Makka or before completing \nthe practices of hajj. He is paid according to the distance he \ntraveled in respect of difficulty or ease and fear, not simple \ndistance. So a quarter of the distance may be equal to half the \nwage. The rest is returned because he is only entitled to the wage \nby completing the task. He is liable for as spent because it is \nrecompense for the task.  \n \nIn the second case the liability is that of the hirers since they were \nnegligent in not stipulating liability which is more careful. The \nform is that he is given money to make hajj and it is his if he \ncompletes it, and he has nothing if he does not.  \n \n \n \nChapter 39: Shares of Inheritance \n \n \nFara’id is the plural of farida, meaning \"duty\". Part of its \nexcellence is indicated by the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) \"Learn the shares and teach them to people. \nKnowledge will be taken away and sedition‟s appear until two \npeople disagree about the share and do not find anyone who can \ndecide between them.\" [Shaikh al-Bayhaqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand others]  \n \n39.1 List of heirs  \n \n39.1a Male heirs  \n \nThere are only ten male heirs: the son, the son's son, to the \nfurthest generation, the father, the paternal grandfather, \nto the furthest generation, the brother, the son of the \nbrother, to the furthest generation, the paternal uncle, and \nthe son of the paternal uncle, to the furthest generation, \nthe husband and the male client.  \n \nBrothers includes full brothers and half brothers by the father \n(consanguine). The same is true of paternal uncles. The client is \none who has been freed by a person.  \n \n39.1b Female heirs  \n \nThere are only seven female heirs: daughter, daughter of \nthe son, mother, grandmother, sister, wife and female \nclient.  \n \nThis is the full sister or the consanguine sister.  \n \n39.2 Husband  \n \nIf the wife has no children or grandchildren, the husband \ninherits half. If she has children or grandchildren by him \nor by another husband, he gets a fourth.  \n \nIf she has children by another marriage or by illicit sex or li'an, by \na free man or slave, Muslim or unbeliever. This is taken from the \nBook of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n39.3 Wife  \n \nIf the husband has no children or grandchildren, the wife \ninherits a fourth. If he has children or grandchildren by \nher or by another wife, she gets an eighth.  \n \nThis is taken from the Book of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nHashiyya: In the case of spouses inheriting from one another, they \nmust both be Muslim, free, and not the killer of the spouse, and \nthe marriage must be sound.  \n \n39.4 Mother  \n \n39.4a The basic rule  \n \nA mother inherits a third from her son if he leaves neither \nchild or grandchild or two or more brothers except in two \ncases.  \n \nWhen there is any sort of sibling, full or half, provided they are \nfree Muslims and not the killers.  \n \n39.4b The first exception  \n \nThe first is when he leaves a wife and both parents. Then \nthe wife gets a fourth and the mother a third of what \nremains and then the rest goes to the father.  \n \nWhat remains is two shares. If the grandfather is in place of the \nfather, she takes an actual third of the estate because she inherits \nthe share with him and if it is the father, it is by virtue of \nagnation [males who are residual heirs].  \n \n39.4c The second exception  \n \nThe second is when a woman leaves a husband and both \nparents. The husband gets a half and the mother a third of \nwhat remains and the rest is taken by the father.  \n \nShe receives a sixth. The husband has three sixths, the mother \none sixth, and the two remaining sixths go to the father.  \n \nThese two cases are called Gharawayn because the mother is \n\"duped\" [gharrat] in them, and takes a third in expression, not \nmeaning because in the first she has a fourth and in other a sixth.  \n \n39.4d 'Awl [Accommodation]  \n \nIn other cases, the mother receives a third unless her share \nis decreased by 'awl [accommodation].  \n \nIn other than these two cases, she receives a full third. \nAccommodation occurs when there are more shares than the \nestate. That is when the number of shares is multiplied, as \ntwenty-four shares is like two-thirds and two-sixths. The share is \nnot denied by it, and it is not possible to cancel some of the shares \nwithout an excluder, and none of those with a share is singled out \nfor decrease. Then the number of shares are increased so that the \nloss is divided out between all the people of shares after the people \nowed debts. That is called 'awl and the originator was ibn Abbas \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and the Companions agreed with him.  \n \nThat arose when a woman died in the khalifate of 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) leaving a husband and two sisters. The \nCompanions met and he said to them, \"Allah has allotted half to \nthe husband and two-thirds to the sisters. If I begin with the \nhusband, the sisters will not have their right. If I begin with the \nsisters, the husband will not have his right.\" Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-\nMuttalib (radhi‟Allahu anhu) suggested 'awl. He (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) said, \"I think that when a man dies and leaves six dirhams, \nand a man is due three and another four that the property is \ndivided into sevenths.\" The Companions adopted his (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) position.  \n \n39.4e When the mother gets a sixth  \n \nIf the deceased leaves a child or grandchild through by a \nson or two or more brothers, of whatever sort, then the \nmother has a sixth.  \n \nHe mentions the exclusion off the mother from a third to a sixth \nby two brothers. That is the school of all the Imams except ibn \nAbbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu) He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that she is \nonly excluded by three brothers, seeing evidence in the words of \nAllah azza wa jall, \"If you have brothers or sisters your mother gets \na sixth\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:11) The disagreement derives from the \nminimum of the plural.  \n \n39.5 Father  \n \n39.5a When the father is the sole heir  \n \nIf the father is the only heir, he inherits the entire the \nestate of his child.  \n \nWhether it is a son or a daughter.  \n \n39.5b When there are other heirs  \n \nIf the decreased has a son or grandson by the son, the \nfather takes a sixth. If the deceased has neither child or \ngrandson by the son, the father has a sixth and all the \nothers entitled to shares are given their shares and then he \ntakes the rest.  \n \nOther heirs are the daughter, daughter of the son, or two of more \nof them. If there is anything left, he takes it by virtue of agnation \nsince it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"Give shares to their people, What is left is for the most \nentitled male.\" That exists in the father.  \n \n39.6 Son  \n \n39.6a When the son is sole heir  \n \nAn only son inherits the entire estate, or he takes what is \nleft after the shares of those entitled to a share, like a wife, \nparents, or grandfather or grandmother.  \n \nHe inherits it all when there is no one else entitled to a share. \nWhen he has one or more brothers, they inherit all the property \nand it is shared between them. One begins with the people of \nshares because they are the basis in respect of the asaba because \nthey have specific shares in the Book and Sunnah. If he only has a \nwife, the question is one of eighths. She has an eighth and he has \nthe rest. If he has only two parents, it is in sixths. The parents \nhave two-thirds and he has the rest. If there is a grandmother or \ngrandfather, it is also sixths and the grandfather or grandmother \nhas a sixth and he has the rest. If he has a mother and two \nparents, it is 24ths and the wife has the 3 of her eighth and the \nparents the 8 of their third and the rest is his.  \n \n39.6b A son's son  \n \nA son's son is in the position of the son when there is no \nson.  \n \nThis is the case if there is no direct son, but he is not like the son \nin all aspects because the son is never dropped whereas the son of \nthe son is dropped if there are two parents, two daughters and the \nson's son. He also does not exclude those the son excludes. He also \nis not the same in respect of agnation. The son is an agnate in \nrelation to the daughters but the son's son is not.  \n \n39.6c A son and a daughter  \n \nIf there are a son and a daughter, the male receives twice \nthe share of the female. It is the same whether there are \nseveral or few sons and daughters. They inherit at this \nratio either the entire estate or what is left after people \ntake their shares.  \n \nThis ratio applies is either case. For instance, there are five sons \nand five daughters. They divide the property into fifteen shares \nand it is distributed in that manner.  \n \n39.6d If there is no son  \n \nThe son of a son is like the son in his absence in respect of \ninheritance and exclusion of other heirs.  \n \nThis is repeated.  \n \n39.7 Daughters  \n \nAn only daughter inherits half the estate. Two daughters \ninherit two-thirds of it. If there are more, they do not \nreceive more than two-thirds.  \n \nHer inheritance is based on the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"If she \nis one on her own she gets a half.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:11) The case of \ntwo or more is also based on what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did.  \n \n39.8 Son's daughters  \n \n39.8a Their ruling  \n \nThe daughter of a son is like a daughter when there is no \ndaughter. Similarly, the son's daughters are like daughters \nwhen the deceased himself has no daughters.  \n \nSo the consensus is that she inherits half, and if there are two or \nmore they inherit two-thirds.  \n \n39.8b A daughter and a son's daughter  \n \nIf there is a daughter and the daughter of a son, the \ndaughter gets one half and the daughter of the son gets a \nsixth to complete the two-thirds. If the son has several \ndaughters, they do not get more than the sixth if they have \nno brother with them. The remainder goes to the agnates.  \n \nHer receiving a sixth is based on the judgment of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). The case when there is a brother present \nwill be discussed later.  \n \n39.8c If there are two daughters  \n \nIf there are two daughters, then the daughters of the son \nget nothing unless they have a brother. In that case the \nremainder of the estate is divided between them, the male \ngetting twice the share of the female.  \n \nThey get none of the sixth because the two-thirds is already \ncomplete without them. If nothing remains, they get nothing \nbecause they inherit by agnation and the agnate only inherits \nwhat is left over.  \n \n39.8d A male below the son's daughters  \n \nWhen there is a male in the generation below them, the \nestate is also shared between him and them.  \n \nOn the basis of agnation.  \n \n39.8e A son's daughters  \n \nIt is the same if the daughters of the son inherit a sixth \nwith the daughter, and in the generation below them there \nare daughters of a son or a generation below them which \ncontains a male: the residual estate is shared between him \nand his sisters or paternal aunts in the same way. The \ndaughters of the son who take a share in the two-thirds \nhave no share in the residual estate.  \n \nThis causes agnation and so a male receives the portion of two \nfemales. Ibn 'Umar said that the son of the son causes agnation in \nhis generation and above, but not below.  \n \n39.9 Full and consanguine sisters  \n \n39.9a. The share of the full sister  \n \nA full sister inherits half. Two or more sisters share in two-\nthirds.  \n \nSince Allah azza wa jall says, \"If a man dies childless but has a \nsister she gets half of what he leaves.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:175) The \ntwo-thirds is because Allah azza wa jall says, \"If there are two \nsisters they get two-thirds of what he leaves.\"  \n \n39.9b Brothers and sisters  \n \nIf there are several full or consanguine brothers and \nsisters, then the entire property is divided between them, \nwith the male receiving the share of two females, whether \nthey are many or few.  \n \nBecause Allah azza wa jall says, \"If there are brothers and sisters \nthe males receive the share of two females.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:175)  \n \n39.9c Sisters' share when there are daughters  \n \nIf there are daughters, then the sisters become like the \n'asaba (agnates) inheriting what is left over, but they are \nnot enriched at the daughters' expense.  \n \nThey receive no specific share. They take what is left on the basis \nof agnation, in taking the residual estate, but they are not like the \nagnates in taking all the estate.  \n \n39.9d When they inherit nothing  \n \nBrothers and sisters receive no inheritance when there is a \nfather or a son or a grandson.  \n \nBecause they are a lower generation than the father. When \nsomeone is lower than someone else, he does not inherit along \nwith him. He is excluded and omitted. In the case of a son, he is \nstronger in agnation than them. As for the second, the son of a son \nhas the same position as the son.  \n \n39.9e The absence of full siblings  \n \nIn the absence of full siblings, consanguine siblings are \nlike full siblings, both male and female.  \n \nIf there are several. If there is only one she inherits half. If there \nare males and females, the estate is divided between them with \nthe male getting twice the share of a female.  \n \n39.9f Remaining cases  \n \nIf there is a full sister and one or more consanguine sisters, \nthe full sister gets half and the remaining sisters share in \nthe sixth. If there are two full sisters, the half-sisters \nreceive nothing unless there is a brother with them. Then \nthey take whatever remains, with the male receiving the \nshare of two females.  \n \nThe sixth is to complete the two-thirds. Ibn Mas‟ud (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) said that the consanguine sister has no share in this case. If \nthere are two sisters, they take the full two-thirds and the others \nare removed and only inherit on the basis of agnation.  \n \n30.10 Uterine brothers and sisters  \n \n39.10a Their share  \n \nThe inheritance of a uterine sister and brother is the same: \na sixth, the same for either.  \n \nIf there is only one and there is no distinction between male and \nfemale.  \n \n39.10b When there are several  \n \nIf there are several of them, then the third is shared \nbetween them, each receiving the same amount.  \n \nWhether males, females, or both. They agree that what is meant \nby the brother and sister is His words \"If a man or woman has no \ndirect heirs but has a brother or sister, each of them gets a sixth,\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 4:12) is only the uterine sister. The one without heirs \nis the one who has no children or parent.  \n \n39.10c When they are excluded  \n \nThey are excluded from the inheritance by a child and his \nor her children, a father, or a paternal grandfather.  \n \nThis is complete exclusion. \"Child\" is a daughter or a son. A \nmaternal grandfather does not exclude because he does not \ninherit.  \n \n39.11 Full and consanguine brothers  \n \n39.11a The share of brothers  \n \nThe brother inherits the entire estate if he is the sole heir, \nif he is full brother or has the same father (consanguine). A \nfull brother excludes a consanguine brother.  \n \nHe is all 'asaba. A consanguine brother has this judgment when \nthere is no full brother. If there is a full brother, he excludes the \nhalf brother.  \n \n39.11b When there are several brothers  \n \nIf there is one or more brothers and sisters, full or \nconsanguine, then the estate is shared between them, with \nthe male having twice the share of a female.  \n \nThis is when there are no full brothers. This is repeated.  \n \n39.11c When there are other fixed heirs as well  \n \nIf there are those entitled to specific shares as well as the \nbrother, one begins with those with specific shares and he \ntakes what is left. Similarly what remains goes to the \nbrothers and sisters, with a male receiving twice the share \nof a female.  \n \nThat is because the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"What \nremains after the shares goes to the more entitled man,\" and the \nbrother is included in this. So what is left goes to the full brothers \nor if, there are none, the consanguine brothers, and that is divided \nbetween them.  \n \n39.11d If nothing is left  \n \nIf nothing is left, they receive nothing unless there are \nuterine brothers among the people of shares who inherited \na third. Then any full siblings, male and female, share \nequally with the uterine brothers in their third. This share \nis called \"shared\" (mushtarika). Consanguine brothers do \nnot share with the uterine brothers because they do not \nhave the same mother.  \n \nMales only, or females only, or both. The rest of the heirs inherit \ntwo-thirds, like the wife, mother or grandfather and that \ncompletes the estate.  \nThey share by virtue of having the same mother.  \n \nIt is called \"shared\" because the brothers share in the third, and is \nevery question in which there is a husband and mother or \ngrandmother, and two or more of the mother's offspring, and \n'asaba in the form of full siblings. This is also known as the \nHimariyya case. That is because the case was presented to Umar \nibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and he wanted to judge the \nelimination the full brothers, and one of them said, \"Give. Even if \nour father was a donkey (himar), do we not have the same \nmother?\" So he (radhi‟Allahu anhu) judges a third for all of them \nequally, full and uterine siblings, the portion of the man the same \nas the portion of the female.  \n \n39.11e Remaining sisters are accommodated  \n \nIf there remains any full or consanguine or sisters, \naccommodation is made for them.  \n \nThe sharing is invalid and it becomes one of the questions of 'awl. \nThe accommodation is that a half becomes three-sixths and is \nreduced to three-tenths. The two-thirds of the sisters becomes \nfour-sixths, and is reduced to four-tenths.]  \n \n39.11f Other cases  \n \nIf there is only one uterine brother or sister, the case is not \nmushtarika. The residual estate goes to the siblings \nwhether they are males, or males and females. If there are \nonly full or consanguine sisters, there is accommodation \nfor them.  \n \nWhat is left is a sixth. If there are males and females, the males \nreceive twice the share of the female.  \n \n39.11g Consanguine brother  \n \nA consanguine brother is like the full brother in the \nabsence of a full brother, except in the case of mushtarika.  \n \nThe full preconditions for full brotherhood are missing as they do \nnot share the same mother.  \n \n39.12 Nephews  \n \nThe son of a brother is like the brother in the absence of \nthe brother, whether he is a full or consanguine brother. \nThe son of a uterine brother does not inherit.  \n \nHe is in that position in agnation in particular, not in all aspects. \nOne of the aspects in which he differs is mentioned. The reason \nthat the son of uterine nephew does not inherit is that his father is \none of the people of specific shares and does not enter into \nagnation, and so he is like the son of the daughter.  \n \n39.13 Exclusion of heirs  \n \n39.13a The full brother  \n \nA full brother excludes a consanguine brother, but a \nconsanguine brother takes precedence over the son of a \nfull brother. The son of a full brother takes precedence \nover the son of a consanguine brother.  \n \nThis point is repeated. A consanguine brother is a degree higher \nthan the son of a full brother.  \n \n39.13b Exclusion and the paternal uncle  \n \nA son of a consanguine brother excludes a full paternal \nuncle. A full paternal uncle excludes a consanguine \npaternal uncle. A consanguine paternal uncle excludes the \nson of a full paternal uncle. The son of a full paternal uncle \nexcludes the son of a consanguine paternal uncle. So the \nnearer relative always has the greater entitlement.  \n \nThis is all by the closer level of degree, and the principle is general \nto all relatives.  \n \n39.14 Non-heirs  \n \n39.14a. Those who are non-heirs  \n \nThose who do not inherit include the children of sisters of \nwhatever sort, the sons of daughters, the daughters of a \nbrother of whatever sort, the daughters of a paternal \nuncle, the maternal grandfather, and a uterine paternal \nuncle.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said some texts have, \n\"Nor the maternal grandmother.\" It is also includes uncles.  \n \n39.14b Slavery is an impediment  \n \nA slave does not inherit, nor does a slave who is in the \nprocess of being freed.  \n \nThis includes the umm walad and mudabbar.  \n \n39.14c Difference of religion is an impediment  \n \nA Muslim does not inherit from an unbeliever nor an \nunbeliever from a Muslim.  \n \nThe majority position is that a Muslim does not inherit from an \nunbeliever and there is consensus that an unbeliever does inherit \nfrom a Muslim.  \n \n39.14d Others  \n \nOthers who do not inherit are: the son of a uterine brother, \nthe maternal grandfather and the mother of the maternal \ngrandfather.  \n \nAlready mentioned.  \n \n39.15 More excluded heirs  \n \n39.15a. Others who are excluded  \n \nNor does the mother of the paternal grandfather inherit \nalong with her son, the father of the deceased.  \n \nShe, in fact, does not inherit at all.   \n \n39.15b Uterine brothers  \n \nUterine brothers do not inherit with the paternal \ngrandfather, \nnor \nwith \nthe \nsons \nor \ndaughters \nor \ngrandchildren through a son. Siblings of any sort do not \ninherit with the father.  \n \nThis is repeated.  \n \n39.15c Paternal uncles  \n \nA paternal uncle does not inherit with the paternal \ngrandfather nor the son of a brother with the paternal \ngrandfather.  \n \nBecause the level of the grandfather is that of the brother, and the \nbrother excludes his son and those in his rank.  \n \n39.16 Impediment of homicide  \n \n39.16a Homicide is a bar to inheritance  \n \nThe murderer does not inherit either the estate or blood \nmoney. Someone guilty of accidental homicide does not \ninherit any of the blood money, but does inherit from the \nestate.  \n \nThis is about the person who kills the deceased. As for the one \nwho kills deliberately without transgression, like the ruler \nexecuting someone from whom he inherits for a hadd obliged on \nhim, or like someone killing his father who is a bandit, they do \ninherit.  \n \nIn the case of accidental homicide, he is excluded in one place and \nnot in another. For example, there are two brothers and one of \nthem kills the other, then the mother inherits a sixth from the \nbrother and the rest is for the two brothers together, because the \nbrother excludes her from a third to a sixth and she inherits a \nthird of the blood money because the killer does not inherit blood \nmoney and so he does not exclude her.  \n \n39.16b Other impediments  \n \nOther impediments to inheritance are negation of lineage \nby the li'an divorce, and difference in the order of death, as \nwhen a relative dies on a journey or under a collapsed \nbuilding \nand \nthe \nearlier \nis \nunaware \nof \nthat \nthe \nprecondition is missing, i.e. the death of the heir must be \nafter the death of the one who leaves the inheritance.  \n \n39.17 Effect of exclusion  \n \nAnyone who does not inherit for some reason cannot then \nexclude another heir.  \n \nExcept in the five cases mentioned in the Usul.  \n \n39.18 Inheritance by a spouse divorced or married in the \nfinal illness  \n \n39.18a A woman finally divorced in the final illness  \n \nA woman who has been trebly divorced in the final illness \nof her husband inherits from her husband, but if she dies \nfirst, he does not inherit from her. The same ruling applies \nif the divorce was a single one and he dies of that illness \nafter her ‘Idda has finished.  \n \nShe inherits from him because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) forbade excluding an heir by doing that. 'Uthman \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) judged that the wife of 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn \n'Awf (radhi‟Allahu anhu) inherit from him after her ‘Idda was \nover. He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) had divorced her absolutely when he \nwas ill and he died of that illness. The man does not inherit from \nher because she is unrelated to him by virtue of the divorce. Even \nif her ‘Idda is over, she still inherits if he dies of that illness.  \n \n39.18b Divorce while he is in good health  \n \nIf someone in good health pronounces a single divorce \nagainst his wife, they still inherit from one another as long \nas she is still in her ‘Idda. If the ‘Idda has finished, they do \nnot inherit from one another.  \n \nThere is no suspicion about divorce when the person is healthy.  \n \n39.18c Marriage in the final illness  \n \nIf a man marries in his illness, they do not inherit from one \nanother.  \n \nBecause the marriage is invalid.  \n \n39.19 Grandmothers  \n \n39.19a. The ruling  \n \nA maternal grandmother inherits a sixth as does a paternal \ngrandmother.  \n \nAbsolutely because it is established that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) gave her a sixth. (Muwatta')  \n \n39.19b When there are two grandmothers  \n \nIf there are both of them, then the sixth is shared between \nthem, unless the maternal grandmother is a degree closer, \nin which case she is more entitled to it because there is a \ntext about her. If it is the paternal grandmother which is \ncloser, then the sixth is shared between them.  \n \nThe other inherits by way of analogy with the maternal \ngrandmother. The sixth is equally divided unless there is a \ngenerational difference. If, however, it is paternal one which is \ncloser, they share in the sixth because her position is based on \nanalogy, not text.  \n \n39.19c Which grandmothers inherit  \n \nAccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), only two \ngrandmothers \ninherit: \nthe \nfather's \nmother \nand \nthe \nmother's mother or their respective mothers. Zayd ibn \nThabit is reported to have allowed three grandmothers to \ninherit: one on the mother's side and two on the father's \nside: the father's mother and the mother of the father's \nfather. None of the Khalifs is reported to have allowed \nmore than two grandmothers to inherit.  \n \nThey take their place in their absence since the nearer excludes \nthe further as we stated.  \n \n39.20 Paternal grandfather  \n \n39.20a His share  \n \nIf there is only the paternal grandfather, he takes the \nentire estate.  \n \nThis is when there are no full or consanguine brothers or sisters or \nany others of the people of specific shares, like a daughter and \ndaughter of a son.  \n \n39.20b If there are other heirs  \n \nIf there is also a son or a son's son, the paternal \ngrandfather takes a sixth. If there are people with specific \nshares other than brothers and sisters, he is given a sixth. \nIf there is anything left over, it is his.  \n \nIf there are people with specific shares, he has a sixth of the basic \nestate as was mentioned. After the grandfather takes the sixth \nand the people take their shares, then he inherits any residual \nestate by agnation.  \n \n39.20c When there are brothers with the people of shares  \n \nIf there are also brothers along with the people of shares, \nthe grandfather has three choices and he can select \nwhichever he prefers, i.e. whichever is best for him. He can \nshare with the brothers, take a sixth of the total estate, or \ntake a third of the residue.  \n \nFull brothers or consanguine brothers. He can choose whichever \ncourse he prefers.  \n \n39.20d When there are only brothers  \n \nIf there are only brothers inheriting with him, he shares \nwith them if it is one or two brothers, or what is their \nequivalent: four sisters. If there are more than two \nbrothers, he takes a third. So when inheriting with \nbrothers, he takes a third, or he divides the estate with \nthem, whichever seems better for him.  \n \nAnd there are no people with specific shares. A third refers to the \ntotal estate.  \n \n39.20e Consanguine brothers  \n \nConsanguine brothers inherit with the grandfather in the \nsame manner as full brothers if there are no full brothers. \nIf there are both full brothers and consanguine brothers, \nthe full brothers may count the consanguine brothers with \nthem to reduce the share of the grandfather. Then they are \nmore entitled than them to that.  \n \nAn exception to this is the mushtarika case which was already \nmentioned.  \n \n39.20f An exception  \n \nAn exception is when there is, in addition to the \ngrandfather, a full sister who has a consanguine brother or \nsister or both. She takes her half of the estate and \nsurrenders what is left to them. Sisters are not enriched at \nthe expense of the grandfather, except in the case of al-\ngharra' which will be explained later.  \n \nShe takes what she would have taken if she had been alone. The \nsister does not get anything when there is a grandfather except in \nthe case known as the Akdariyya or Gharra', in which the sister \nreceives a share with the grandfather.  \n \n39.21 The patron [mawla]  \n \n39.21a The ruling of the client  \n \nWhen the mawla [patron] is the only heir, he or she \ninherits all of the estate, whether the patron is a man or a \nwoman. If there are people with shares as well, then the \npatron takes what is left after they have taken their \nshares.  \n \nThe mawla is the emancipator. When the deceased has no one \nwith a fixed share nor any agnates, the emancipator inherits by \nvirtue of agnation. The wala' goes to the person who sets a slave \nfree because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \nwala' is to flesh like flesh of lineage.\"  \n \nIf there are those entitled shares, and there are no agnates, he \ntakes the remainder because he inherits by agnation and that was \nthe judgment of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). An \nexample is when he leaves a daughter: she takes half and he takes \nthe rest.  \n \n39.21b When there are agnates  \n \nA patron inherits nothing when there are agnates ('asaba), \nbut he is more entitled than uterine relatives who have no \nshare in the Book of Allah azza wa jall. Only uterine \nrelatives who have a share in the Book of Allah azza wa jall \ninherit.  \n \nWhen the deceased has agnates because they inherit by lineage. \nHe is more entitled than uterine relatives because they have no \nagnation and so share.  \n \n39.21c A female patron  \n \nA woman only inherits by wala' from those she herself set \nthe slave free, or through subsequent freeing or childbirth \n[by the slave she set free].  \n \nOnly those she herself set free, or those set free by the one she set \nfree, without or without her permission. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) says, \"Freeing is clear since a woman frees a \nslave and he in turn he frees a slave. The freed slave dies first and \nthen the one he freed dies.\"  \n \nAs for childbirth, there are further details regarding it. When she \nfrees a slavegirl who is pregnant, then the wala' of the slavegirl \nand the child belong to the woman who set her free. The wala' of \nthose the freed slavegirl bears after being frees goes to the patron \nof their father, i.e. those who freed the father. If the father has no \npatrons, it goes to the treasury.  \n \n39.22 Accommodation by reduction [Awl]  \n \n39.22a When it takes place  \n \nWhen the combined shares known in the Book of Allah \nazza wa jall are more than the estate, then all of them are \nreduced and the shares are reduced proportionately.  \n \nWhat is said in this question is that the asl of the share is \nestablished to solve the case. Each heir with a fixed share is given \nhis share and then they are all added together. If the total is equal \nor less than the total estate, there is no accommodation. If, \nhowever, the sum is greater than it, you know that there must be \naccommodation, like the Minbariyya case. Its thirds, sixth and \neighth are more than twenty-four, When there is accommodation, \nthe share is put in the place it reaches in the shares, which is \ntwenty-seven. The Minbariyya is an example of that. It is a wife, \ntwo parents, and two daughters. The two daughters have two-\nthirds, each of the parents has a sixth and the wife has an eighth. \nThe share of the parents is combined and we are content with one, \nwhich is one of six. We add to it the share of the daughters. The \nshare of the wife agrees with the product of six by half and so \nthree times eight gives twenty-four. The daughters have sixteen \nfor the two-thirds, the father's six is four, and the mother has four. \nThis is twenty-four. Then we need the wife's share, so \naccommodate her eighth into three shares and then the total is \ntwenty-seven.  \n \n39.22b Al-Gharra'  \n \nThere is no accommodation for a sister when there is a \ngrandfather except in the gharra' case. This is when a \nwoman \ndies \nleaving \na \nhusband, \nmother, \nfull \nor \nconsanguine sister and a paternal grandfather. The \nhusband gets half, the mother a third, and the grandfather \na sixth. Since the estate is exhausted, there must be \naccommodation for the sister's share of half, which is \nthree. Then the share of the grandfather is added to her \nshare, and the total of that is divided between them in \nthirds. She has a third and he has two-thirds, and so there \nare twenty-seven shares.  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) named the case this. The \nquestion is one of sixths. Half is three, a third is two and a sixth is \none. So by accommodation, the question becomes one of nine. Then \nthe grandfather says to the sister, \"You cannot have more in the \ninheritance because you are with me like a brother, so return \nwhat you have, which is three, to what I have, which is a share so \nthat we can divide it with the male having twice the share of a \nfemale. Four to three is not sound and does not agree and so three, \nthe number of the separate parts for accommodation of the shares, \nis multiplied, which gives 9 and so it is two: the three for the \nhusband multiplied into the three by nine. The sister and \ngrandfather have four multiplied by three which is twelve and the \nsister takes her third which is four and the grandmother takes her \nthird, which is eight.  \n \n \n \nChapter 40. A General Chapter on the Legal \nStatus of Various Practices \n \n \nThis deals with things which are fara’id [obligatory], mandatory \nor stressed Sunnah or recommended. He starts with fiqh topics:  \n \n40.1. Wudu'  \n \n40.1a Its status  \n \nWudu' for the prayer is obligatory. It is derived from \nwada'a [cleanliness].  \n \nIt is obligatory for both obligatory or voluntary prayers. Shaikh \nZarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"This is outwardly by removing \nfilth and inwardly expiation of wrong actions.\" Lest someone \nimagine that all its elements are obligatory, he goes into further \ndetails.  \n \n40.1b Sunnah elements  \n \nHowever, rinsing the mouth, inhaling water through the \nnose and wiping the ears in it are Sunnah.  \n \nEach of these parts is a Sunnah.  \n \n40.1c Siwak [Cleaning the teeth]  \n \nSiwak is recommended and desired.  \n \nThis is when doing wudu'. It is very desirable.  \n \n40.1d Wiping over leather socks  \n \nWiping over leather socks is an allowance (rukhsa) and \nmitigation.  \n \nIt is permitting something normally not allowed. It is permitted \nboth while resident and while traveling with certain preconditions \nwhich were already mentioned.  \n \n40.2 Ghusl  \n \n40.2a Obligatory ghusl  \n \nGhusl on account of janaba, menstruation and lochia is \nobligatory.  \n \nJanaba is due to ejaculation or penetration.  \n \n40.2b Sunnah ghusl  \n \nThe ghusl on Jumu'a is Sunnah.  \n \nIt is a stressed Sunnah. If it is for attending the Jumu'a, it is \nmandatory.  \n \n40.2c Recommended ghusl  \n \nA ghusl for the two ‘Ids is recommended.  \n \nThis is the well-known position. It is also said that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.2d Ghusl when becoming Muslim  \n \nIt is obligatory for someone who becomes Muslim to \nperform ghusl because he is in janaba.  \n \nThis is a general assumption. The ghusl is on account of janaba. If \nit is verified that there has been no janaba, it is not mandatory.  \n \nHashiyya: The well-known position is that one has a ghusl before \nsaying the shahadah.  \n \n40.2e Washing the dead  \n \nGhusl for the dead is a Sunnah.  \n \nWashing him unless he is a martyr from a battle or a miscarriage \nwho has not cried. It is forbidden to wash the martyr.  \n \nHashiyya: The well-known position of the Maghribis is that it is \nSunnah while the Iraqis say that it is fard kifayah.  \n \n40.3 The Prayer  \n \n40.3a The obligatory prayer and its elements  \n \nThe five prayers are obligatory, as is saying the takbir al-\nIhram. The rest of the takbirs are Sunnah.  \n \nHash: Saying, \"Allahu Akbar\". This is for those who can say it \nproperly. If one cannot properly articulate it, he begins the prayer \nby the intention. Imam Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that all \nthe takbirs are one Sunnah which differs from the position of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) that each one is a \nSunnah.  \n \nBeginning the prayer with the intention of performing the \nobligation is obligatory.  \n \nThe intention is within the words of the takbir. If it is later than \nthat, it is not satisfied. Nor is it satisfied if it is a lot before it. If it \nis made a little before it, it satisfies the requirement. The most \ncomplete form is that the intention accompany the takbir.  \n \nRaising the hands is Sunnah.  \n \nRaising the hands only refers to the takbir al-ihram and not the \nrest of the takbirs. It is also said that it is recommended.  \n \nThey are raised opposite the ears or a little below them.  \n \nRecitation of the Fatiha in the prayer is obligatory and \nreciting more of the Holy Qur'an is a mandatory Sunnah.  \n \nRecitation of the Fatiha is obligatory for the Imam and the person \npraying alone in every rak'at. The obligation is satisfied by the \nImam in the case of someone following an Imam.   \n \nStanding, bowing and prostration are obligatory.  \n \nStanding in the prayer is obligatory for the one who is able to do \nit. If someone omits any of the obligatory standing, bowing and \nprostration, the prayer becomes invalid.  \n \nThe first sitting is Sunnah and the second is obligatory.  \n \nThe first sitting contains the two tashahhuds.  \n \nSaying the salam is obligatory and turning the head to \nright while saying it a little is Sunnah.  \n \nThe final salam which ends the prayer is obligatory for every \nprayer, but not the prostration of recitation.  \n \nNot speaking in the prayer is obligatory and the \ntashahhud is Sunnah.  \n \nThe only speaking allowed in the prayer is to correct the Imam, \nwhich should be kept to a minimum or else it invalidates the \nprayer. The two tashahhuds are Sunnah according to the well-\nknown position.   \n \n40.3b Qunut  \n \nThe Qunut in the Subh prayer is good, but not Sunnah.  \n \nThe Qunut done silently is recommended, but not a strong Sunnah \nand so there is no prostration owed by the one who forgets it.  \n \nFacing qibla is obligatory.  \n \nFacing the qibla is obligatory in every prayer with bowing and \nprostration and other prayers like the funeral prayer, except in \nintense fear in face of the enemy or illness when there is no one to \nmove the invalid towards qibla. He then prays however he can.  \n \n40.4 Other prayers  \n \n40.4a The Jumu'a prayer  \n \nThe Jumu'a prayer and going to it are obligatory.  \n \nHash: It is individual obligation for every free adult male. There \nmust be a special intention for it as Jumu'a. Shaikh al-Lakhmi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), however, said that it is a fard kifayah and \nShaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.4b The witr prayer  \n \nThe witr prayer is a mandatory Sunnah,  \n \nMandatory Sunnah‟s are stressed, and the most mandatory of \nthem is the witr, then the ‘Id prayers, then the eclipse and then \nthe rain prayer.   \n \n40.4c Other mandatory Sunnah’s  \n \nas are the two ‘Id prayers, the eclipse prayer, the rain \nprayer, and the fear prayer.  \n \nHash: The position which is relied on is that the prayer for a lunar \neclipse is recommended.  \n \n40.4d The fear prayer  \n \nThe fear prayer is mandatory Sunnah since Allah azza wa \njall commanded it. It is an act by which they obtain the \nexcellence of the group prayer.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall commanded the fear prayer when He says, \n\"When you are with them and are leading them in the prayer\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 4:101-3) The prayer in itself is obligatory, and \nSunnah in the form mentioned.  \n \n40.5 Ghusl before entering Makka  \n \nIt is recommended to have a ghusl before entering Makka.  \n \n40.6 Joining prayers  \n \n40.6a. Rainy nights  \n \nJoining prayers on a rainy night is mitigation. The Rightly-\nguided khalifs did it.  \n \nJoining Maghrib and 'Isha' when it is dark and muddy. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it and he is the model as did \nthe Rightly Guided Khalifs.  \n \n40.6b Joining in the hajj  \n \nJoining at 'Arafa and Muzdalifa is a mandatory Sunnah.  \n \nAt 'Arafa it is Dhuhr and 'Asr and at Muzdalifa it is Maghrib and \n'Isha'.  \n \n40.6c Travelers  \n \nA traveler joining prayers in an urgent journey is an \nallowance.  \n \nIn a mandatory journey like performing the obligatory hajj or \nrecommended or permitted journey, like a voluntary hajj or for \ncommerce. The apparent meaning is that the journey must be \nurgent, and that is what is in the Mudawwana, but that is not a \nprecondition in the Mukhtasar.  \n \nHash: There is no allowance for it in a forbidden journey, like one \ninvolving robbery, or a disliked one, like hunting for pleasure.  \n \n40.6d A sick person  \n \nA sick person joining prayers when he fears he will lose \nconsciousness is a concession. The same applies to joining \nthem because it is easier for him.  \n \nThis is an allowance. When he joins the prayers and then does not \nlose consciousness at the time of the second prayer, he repeats the \nprayer. When he joins because of weakness, he joins them with \none wudu' and then it is an easement.  \n \n40.7 Fasting and prayer in a journey  \n \nNot fasting while traveling is an allowance and shortening \nthe prayer while traveling is mandatory.  \n \nThis is in a journey in which he can shorten the prayer. He can \nfast or not fast. The well known position is that fasting is better. \nShortening the prayer, however, is mandatory as it is one of the \nconfirmed Sunnah’s, but it is not unlawful to pray in full.  \n \n40.8 Supererogatory prayers  \n \n40.8a Fajr  \n \nThe two rak'ats of Fajr are desirable, and it is said that \nthey are Sunnah.  \n \nWith a particular intention. The well-known position is that they \nare desirable, and the second position is that of Shaikh ibn al-\nHajib (rahmatullahi alaihi), who follows Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Barr \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n40.8b Duha  \n \nThe Duha prayer is supererogatory.  \n \nThe nafila is what is less than the Sunnah and the desirable.  \n \nHash: The Mukhtasar states that is excellent. Its minimum is two \nrak'ats and its maximum is eight rak'ats with the majority of the \npeople of the School. It is also said that it has no maximum. Its \ntime begins with the nafila becomes permitted.  \n \n40.8c Night prayers  \n \nPraying at night in Ramadan is supererogatory and there \nis great virtue in it. If someone does it with faith and in \nanticipation of a reward, he will be forgiven his past wrong \nactions. Praying at night in Ramadan and other times is \ndesirable and supererogatory.  \n \nThis is the tarawih prayers. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said in a sound hadith, \"Whoever prays at night in \nRamadan in faith and anticipation of the reward will be forgiven \nhis past wrong actions.\"  \n \nHash: Night prayers are a sign of the righteous. They are best \ndone in the last third of the night. This is the tahajjud.  \n \n40.9 The Funeral Prayer  \n \nThe prayer over dead Muslims is obligatory and the duty is \nsatisfied by those who perform it. The same applies to \ntaking them to burial. Washing them is a mandatory \nSunnah.  \n \nIt is a fard kifayah or Sunnah kifayah. As for the Sunnah of \nwashing, whoever says that the ghusl is Sunnah says that the \nprayer is Sunnah, and those who say that it is mandatory, say \nthey are both mandatory. It is most likely that both are \nmandatory.  \n \n40.10 Knowledge  \n \nThe same is true of seeking knowledge. It is a general \nobligation which is satisfied by those who perform it \nexcept for that knowledge which is obliged individually for \na man.  \n \nIt is mandatory for all the Muslims. Individually obliged \nknowledge is like tauhid, wudu', prayer, hajj, buying and selling \nby what is confirmed and established that it is not permitted for \nanyone to embark on a matter until he knows the ruling of Allah \nazza wa jall in it. This is about individual obligations which no one \ncan do for another.  \n \n40.11 Jihad and forts  \n \n40.11a Jihad  \n \nThe obligation of jihad is general and is satisfied by those \nwho perform it, unless the enemy attack the settlement of a \npeople in which case it become obligatory for them to fight \nthem provided the enemy are not twice their number or \nmore.  \n \nIt is a general obligation for the Muslims as a whole. If the enemy \nsuddenly attacks the settlement of the people, then it becomes an \nindividual obligation for male and female, free and slave. When, \nhowever, the enemy is twice the number of the Muslims, they are \npermitted to flee.  \n \n40.11b Ribat  \n \nRibat at the frontiers of the Muslims and defending them \nand fortifying them is mandatory and the duty is satisfied \nby those who undertake this.  \n \nStaying at the frontiers. This is a fard kifayah.  \n \n40.12 Fasting  \n \n40.12a Obligatory fasting  \n \nFasting the month of Ramadan is an obligation.  \n \nFor every responsible Muslim who is not menstruating or bleeding \nafter childbirth.  \n \n40.12b I'tikaf  \n \nI'tikaf is supererogatory.  \n \nNafila. It is staying in the mosque for dhikr and reciting the Holy \nQur'an. It is also said that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.12c Supererogatory fasting  \n \nVoluntary fasting is desirable. It is desirable to fast the day \nof 'Ashura', the month of Rajab, the month Sha'ban, the day \nof 'Arafa and the Day of Tarwiya. Fasting the Day of 'Arafa \nis better for someone not performing hajj than for the one \non hajj.  \n \nThis is fasting at times when it is not forbidden to fast. It is better \nexplained by the words of the Almighty, \"The steadfast will be \npaid their wages in full without any reckoning.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n39:10) Steadfastness is explained as meaning fasting.  \n \n'Ashura' is the 10th of Muharram.  \n \n[Hash: It is desirable to fast it based on what Sahih Muslim states \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said when he was \nasked about fasting the Day of 'Arafa. He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"It expiates the past and future year.\" He was asked about \nfasting 'Ashura' and said, \"It expiates the past year.\"  \n \n'Arafa is the 9th of Dhu'l-Hijja and Tarwiya is the eight of Dhu'l-\nHijja. It is better for the hajji not to fast the Day of 'Arafa.  \n \n40.13 Zakat  \n \nZakat on money, crops and livestock is obligatory. The \nzakat al-fitr is a Sunnah made obligatory by the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \nHash: Money means gold and silver, to exclude new filus, even if it \nis the currency. Trading good are also included.  \n \nZakat al-Fitr was made mandatory by the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam).  \n \nHash. It is said that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.14 Hajj and 'Umra  \n \n40.14a Its ruling  \n \nMaking hajj to the House is obligatory and 'umra is a \nmandatory Sunnah.  \n \nIt is obligatory once in a lifetime. 'Umra is a confirmed Sunnah \nonce in a lifetime.  \n \n40.14b Its elements  \n \nThe talbiya is a mandatory Sunnah. The intention to \nperform the hajj is obligatory. Tawaf al-Ifada is obligatory \nand the sa'y between Safa and Marwa is obligatory. The \ntawaf connected to it is mandatory and the Tawaf al-Ifada \nis more stressed than it. The tawaf of Farewell is Sunnah.  \n \nThe Tawaf al-Ifada is after the return from 'Arafa. The tawaf \nconnected to Sa'y is the Tawaf of Arrival. If it is omitted, there is \na sacrifice owed for its omission. The Mukhtasar says that the \nTawaf of Farewell is recommended.  \n \n40.14c Further elements  \n \nSpending the night at Mina on the Day of 'Arafa is Sunnah. \nJoining prayers at 'Arafa is mandatory and standing at \n'Arafa is obligatory. Spending the night at Muzdalifa is a \nmandatory Sunnah. Stopping at the Mash'ar al-Haram is \ncommanded. Stoning the jamras is a mandatory Sunnah.  \n \nThere is no sacrifice owed by someone who misses the night at \nMina. \"Commanded\" here means recommended.  \n \n40.14d Shaving the head and kissing the Black Stone  \n \nThat is also true of shaving. Kissing the Black stone is a \nmandatory Sunnah.  \n \nShaving the head is a mandatory Sunnah for a man, not a woman. \nKissing the Black Stone is in the first circuit.  \n \nHashiyya: Shortening the hair is also allowed. Sacrifice is obliged \nfor the one who omits it or delays it. For women, the duty is to \nshorten it.  \n \n40.14e Ghusl during hajj  \n \nA ghusl for assuming ihram is Sunnah and two rak'ats at \nthat time is Sunnah.  \n \nA ghusl at 'Arafa is Sunnah and a ghusl for entering Makka \nis recommended.  \n \nGhusl for assuming ihram is Sunnah for both a man and a \nwoman, even if she is menstruating or has lochia. Ghusl at 'Arafa \nis Sunnah for standing at 'Arafa.  \n \n40.15 Group prayer  \n \n40.15a Its excellence  \n \nDoing the prayer in a group is twenty-seven times better \nthan praying alone.  \n \nOne version has 25. It is certainly far better than praying alone.  \n \n40.15b The prayer in particular mosques  \n \nPraying in the Masjid al-Haram and the Masjid of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) alone is better than praying \nin other masajid. There is disagreement about the \ndifference in the amount of excellence between the Masjid \nal-Haram and the Masjid of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). There is no disagreement that praying in the Masjid \nof the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) is better than a \nthousand prayers in other masajid except for the Masjid al-\nHaram. The people of Madina say that the prayer in the \nHoly Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) Masjid is better than \nthe prayer in the Masjid al-Haram, but less than a \nthousand times better. This is all about obligatory prayers. \nAs for voluntary prayers, they are better done at home.  \n \nThe Mosque of Jerusalem in next in excellence. This is the \ndisagreement about whether Makka or Madina is better. The well-\nknown position of the School is that Madina is better. The \nmeaning of the difference in their excellence is in the reward for \naction done in one of them is more than the other. There is also a \ndifference of opinion about whether the prayer in the masjid of \nMadina or better or in the Masjid al-Haram. Some say that the \nprayer in the Holy Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) Masjid is 700 \ntimes more excellent.  \n \nVoluntary prayers are better done at home because the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Put some of your prayers in \nyour houses.\"  \n \nHash: Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) related from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he preferred nafila prayers \nat home to nafila prayers in the Masjid of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) except for visitors. He preferred that they do their \nnafila in the masjid.  \n \n40.15c The difference between prayer and tawaf  \n \nWe prefer for the people of Makka to do supererogatory \nprayers than to do tawaf, but tawaf is better than the \nprayer for visitors because of the little opportunity they \nhave to do.  \n \nThis is the position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). This is \nso that they do not crowd the visitors.  \n \n40.16 Looking at women  \n \nIt is an obligation to lower the eye and not look at \nforbidden women, but there is no harm in the first glance \nwhen it is not deliberate, not in looking at woman who \ndoes provoke desire nor in looking at a young woman for a \nlegitimate reason, such as identifying her and the like. \nThere is a similar allowance for someone proposing \nmarriage.  \n \nShaikh ibn al-Qattan (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that there is \nconsensus that no major wrong action is connected to the eye, but \nit is the faculty which brings the greatest harm to the heart and is \nquickest in destroying the din and this world. It is forbidden to \nlook at a woman who is not related within the prohibited degrees \nor a beardless youth for pleasure since Allah azza wa jall tells the \nbelievers, \"Lower your eyes.\" (Holy Qur‟an 24:30)  \n \nThere is no wrong action in the first glance which is not \nintentional nor at looking a woman for there is no attraction for \nmen. Identification is for marriage, or for sales purposes. The \nsame principle applies to the doctor and surgeon, which is what is \nmeant by \"the like\".  \n \nThere is an allowance for someone who intends to marry who \nwants to know what the woman is like. This is confined to the face \nand hands. There is an allowance for looking at the face since the \nface indicates beauty and the hands indicate the plumpness of the \nbody. The origin of that is the command of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n40.17 Immoral speech  \n \nIt is an obligation to guard one's tongue from lying, \nperjury, obscene language, backbiting, gossiping, and all \nfalsehood. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Anyone who believes in Allah azza wa jall and the Last \nDay should speak well or be silent.\" The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Part of the excellence of a \nperson's Islam is his leaving alone what does not concern \nhim.\"  \n \nThis is one of the mandatory matters.  \n \nLying  \n \nHash: Lying is forbidden because Allah azza wa jall says, \"And \ncall down the curse of Allah upon the liars...\" (Holy Qur‟an 3:60) \nand the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no \ngood in lying.\" The consensus is that it is forbidden.  \n \nPerjury  \n \nA person should guard his tongue against perjury, which is \ntestifying to what he does not know, even if it actually happened.  \n \nHash: It is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Shall I tell you of the greatest of wrong actions?\" and \nhe repeated that three times. They said, \"Yes, Rasulullah.\" He \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Associating others with Allah, azza \nwa jall, disobeying parents.\" He was reclining and sat up and said, \n\"And lying words and perjury.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) \ncontinued to repeat until they wished he would be silent.  \n \nObscene language [Fahsha']  \n \nHe should guard his tongue from obscene language, which is every \nforbidden word or deed.  \n \nBackbiting [ghiba]  \n \nHe should guard it against backbiting which is that someone says \nsomething about another which he dislikes behind his back. That \nexcludes him disliking for his obedience to be mentioned, because \nthis is praise, and praise is not like that. If he praises him for \nwhat he dislikes and does not have, that is forbidden because it is \na lie, not slander.  \n \nGossiping [namima]  \n \nGossiping is passing on words about someone to someone else for \ncorruption.  \n \nFalsehood [batil]  \n \n \nAll falsehood means words since their source is the tongue. What \nis meant by falsehood are words and falsehood is too varied to be \nenumerated. It is the opposite of the truth.  \n \nThen the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) offers evidence in the form \nof two sound hadiths. Even if they stem from specific cases, they \nare obligatory in general. It is generally seeking to guard the \ntongue against lying. In the first hadith it appears that he can \nchoose between speaking good or being silent about it. That is not \nsound because some words can be mandatory, like commanding \nthe correct and forbidding the bad. This is why it is not taken \nliterally. It means: He should speak good or be silent about evil, \ni.e. seeking by both courses to do good.  \n \nA person should leave all that does not concern him, which means \nall that does not bring him benefit in his deen or the Next World. \nThat which concerns him is that whose abandonment will cause \nhim to miss the reward. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Part of \nthe excellence of a person's Islam,\" not \"part of a person's Islam\" \nbecause that it is not the attribute of Islam, but part of its \nexcellence.  \n \n40.18 Taking a Muslim's life or property  \n \n40.18a The basic ruling  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has made the blood of Muslims, their \nproperty and their honor inviolable except for a right.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"Do not kill any person Allah has made \ninviolate, except by a legal right.\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:33) The same \napplies to the people of dhimma and treaty. Allah azza wa jall has \nmade their property inviolable when He says \"Do not consume one \nanother's property by false means\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:21) and the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The worst of usury in the \nsight of Allah azza wa jall is making a Muslim's honor fair game.\" \nWhat is meant is speaking about his honor, which is making it fair \ngame.  \n \n40.18b The exceptions to that rule  \n \nThe life of a Muslim is not lawful unless he apostasies after \nbelief, commits illicit sex after he is muhsan, kills someone \nwhen it is not a case of retaliation, or engages in \ncorruption in the earth or renounces the deen.  \n \nThe exception to this inviolability is for a legal right, which refers \nto the three matters which he mentioned. In property, anyone who \ndestroys something must pay for it.  \n \nThe cases when taking life is permitted are indicated here. In the \ncase of apostasy, he is asked to repent for three days. \"Corruption \nin the earth\" is banditry and highway robbery. Renouncing the \ndeen is to embrace the dogma of the people of the sects about \nwhom the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"They will \npass through the din like an arrow passes through game.\" In the \nMisbah, it goes through one side and comes out the other.  \n \n40.19 Sexual and related restrictions  \n \n40.19a Avoiding the unlawful  \n \nYou should keep your hands from what is not lawful to you \nin property, body or blood. Do not let your feet move after \nwhat is not lawful for you.  \n \nIn property it is like theft. In body it is touching other than one's \nwife or slavegirl. Blood includes both killing and wounding.  \n \n40.19b Sexual restrictions  \n \nDo not let your private parts or any of your body touch \nwhat is not lawful for you, Allah azza wa jall says, \"those \nwho guard their private parts – except from their wives or \nthose they own as slaves, in which case they are not \nblameworthy; but those who desire anything more than that \nare people who have gone beyond the limits .\" (Holy Qur’an \n23:5-7)  \n \nDo not advance to illicit sex.  \n \n40.19c Prohibition  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden obscenity, whether open \nor secret, and approaching women sexually when they are \nbleeding from menstruation or lochia. He has forbidden \nmarriage to the women who were already mentioned.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"My Lord has forbidden indecency, both \nopen and secret.\" (Holy Qur‟an 7:3) Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that fawahish includes every ugly word or action \nwhich appears on the limbs or is in the consciousness and hearts. \nAllah azza wa jall forbade vaginal intercourse with women during \nmenstruation or lochia. Other than looking is forbidden to enjoy \nwhat is between the waist and knee, even without intercourse, \nand from above a barrier. There is nothing wrong in looking. The \nconfirmation of this is the words of the Almighty, \"Do not \napproach them until they have purified themselves.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n2:220) He already mentioned the women it is forbidden to marry.  \n \nHash: The consensus is that it is permitted to enjoy what is above \nit. As for what is below the waist other than the vagina, there are \ntwo positions. The most famous is that it is forbidden. There is \ndisagreement about the reason for the prohibition. It is said that it \nis based on devotion (i.e. no logical reason) and it is said that it is \nfeared that any child conceived from such intercourse will suffer \nfrom leprosy, and it is said that it is feared that it will harm the \nman. This prohibition applies to non-Muslim women as well as \nMuslim women because the prohibition is directed to the husband.  \n \n40.20 Doing what is good and avoiding doubtful things  \n \n40.20a. Good is commanded  \n \nAllah azza wa jall commanded eating what is good, which \nis the lawful. It is only lawful for you to eat what is lawful \nor to wear what is lawful or to ride what is lawful or live in \nwhat is lawful. Everything else which you use must be \nlawful.  \n \nThe halal is that which has no consequences and is not connected \nto the a right of Allah azza wa jall or a right for others, That is \nindicated by His words, \"O you who believe! Eat of the good things \nWe have provided for you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:171) What is meant \nhere by eating (akl) is use. When you know that Allah azza wa jall \nhas commanded you to eat what is lawful, it is only lawful for you \nto consume what is lawful. Ibn Abbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"Allah azza wa jall does not accept the prayer of someone who has \nthe haram in his belly.\" Also, \"If someone eats a morsel of the \nharam, Allah azza wa jall will not accept his actions for forty \ndays.\"  \n \nIn riding, it is not lawful to ride a usurped or stolen mount. Living \nin a dwelling bought by stolen goods is unlawful.  \n \n40.20b Doubtful things  \n \nBesides good things there are doubtful things. If someone \nleaves them, he is safe, and if someone takes them, he is \nlike someone who grazes around a private preserve: he is \nlikely to stray into it.  \n \nBesides the lawful, there are things whose legality is uncertain. A \nprivate preserve linguistically is that which is protected by power \nand which others are forbidden to graze in it. What is meant is to \navoid the doubtful and confine oneself to the lawful. This is based \non the famous hadith: 'The halal is clear and the haram is clear. \nBut between the two there are doubtful things about which most \npeople have no knowledge. Whoever exercises caution with regard \nto what is doubtful, shows prudence in respect of his deen and his \nhonor. Whoever gets involved in the doubtful things is like a \nherdsman who grazes his animals near a private preserve [hima]. \nHe is bound to enter it.\"  \n \n40.21 Injury to property rights  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden taking property falsely. \nFalse \nacquisition \nincludes \nmisappropriation, \ntransgression, treachery, usury, bribery, gambling, risk, \nadulteration, deceit and duping.  \n \ni.e. taking it in an impermissible manner. What is meant is not \nactually \"eating\"  \n \nThe text uses 'akl'. It is a metaphor for taking because \nconsumption is often done by eating.  \n \nUsurpation [ghasb] is taking wrongful possession of someone \nelse's property.  \n \nHash: This is not like highway robbery (hiraba) where the rightful \nowner has no access to help.  \n \nTransgression (ta'addi) is in the 'ariyya and renting.  \n \nHash: Like increasing the size of the land loaned to a person or \nincreasing the burden carried by a rented animal.  \n \nTreachery [khiyana] is to be treacherous towards someone \nregarding his property, family or trust or himself.  \n \nUsury is to increase the price or term in a manner not permitted.  \n \nSuht is a bribe which a witness takes for his testimony or a judge \nfor his rulings.  \n \nHash: This also includes things like the earning of a prostitute.  \n \nGambling is earning by backgammon and other forms.  \n \nRisk [gharar] is excessive risk like buying a bird in the air or a \nfish in the sea. A small risk is allowed because sales cannot be \nachieved without it like grains sold which might contain some \nmud.  \n \nAdulteration [ghashsh] is to mix something base with the goods.  \n \nHash: Other forms of this is perfuming garments and watering \nanimals after giving them salt (so they appear plump).  \n \nDeceit [khadi'a] is by word or deed to achieve a worldly desire. \nThis is like when he says to a man who comes to him, \"Your day is \nblessed. You have your desire,\" until he buys from him. Duping \n[khalaba] is like deceit.  \n \n40.22 Forbidden meat  \n \n40.22a Meat which is forbidden  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden carrion, blood, pork and \nwhat is hallowed to other than Allah azza wa jall and what \nis sacrificed to other than Allah azza wa jall, and that \nwhose death has been caused by falling from a mountain or \nbeing hit with a stick or something else, or strangled with \na rope or something else.  \n \n Carrion other than that of the sea.  \n \nHash: There is disagreement about the reason for the prohibition \nof the first three. It is said that is a pure act of devotion. It is said \nthat the reason is logical: carrion is dangerous to the health, blood \ncauses the heart to become hard, and pork removes shame [i.e. \nleads to open lewdness].  \n \n\"Hallowed\" means slaughtered with the voices raising mentioning \nother than Allah azza wa jall, like the name of the Messiah (Isa \n[AS]). He also forbade what is sacrificed to things like idols. There \nis nothing wrong, however, in eating the food of the People of the \nBook, which is a seeming contradiction inasmuch as the \nslaughtered animals of the People of the Book are mostly directed \nto Nabi 'Isa (alaihi salam), for instance, which would be \nslaughtering for other than Allah azza wa jall. Abdullah ibn \n'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) answered what was said here means \nthe sacrifices of the Magians. In short, it would seem that the \nslaughtered animals of the People of the Book are absolutely \neaten, whether they are hallowed to other than Allah azza wa jall \nor not, but that is not the case. The fiqh of the matter is that the \nanimals of the Kitabis are not lawful when they are specifically \nhallowed to other than Allah azza wa jall and the slaughtered \nanimals of the Magians are never lawful.  \n \nWhat falls from a mountain is not eaten, even if it is slaughtered \nbecause one does not know what the cause of death was, Helping \nto die is with an arrow or stick or the like the stone. Strangled \nanimals includes what is strangled between two branches. The \nevidence for prohibition is the words of Allah azza wa jall, \n\"Forbidden for you are carrion, blood and pork\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:4)  \n \n40.22b Dire necessity  \n \nUnless there is dire need of such meat, like carrion.  \n \nWhen one is forced to eat that, it is not unlawful to eat it, like \ncarrion of animals which are eaten or that of animals which are \nnot eaten, except for the human being.  \n \n40.22c The extent to which it is allowed  \n \nWhen an animal reaches a state after which it cannot live \ndue to those reasons, then there is no slaughter of it. There \nis no harm in someone compelled by necessity eating \ncarrion and having his fill and taking provision from it. \nWhen he has no need of it, then he throws it away.  \n \nThis is what will customarily result in death. It appear from what \nhe says that this is the case whether you administer the mortal \nblow or not. This is different from the School. The specifics in the \nSchool is that if has definitely or probably receives a mortal \nwound, there is no slaughter in that. If that is not the case, \nslaughter is accomplishes in it, even if it must die. The one forced \nby necessity can eat. One might think that not eating is better, \nbut that is not the case. Eating is mandatory as Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said since the Almighty says, \"Do not kill \nyourselves.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:29)  \n \nHe eats his fill as Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says. \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he only eats what will \nsustain life. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he can \ntake provision from it. It is also said that he does not do that. It is \nmandatory to discard it when it is no longer needed.  \n \nHash: The position of the majority is that he eats his fill.  \n \n40.22d Skins of carrion  \n \nThere is no harm in using its skin when it as been tanned, \nbut one does not pray on it nor sell it.  \n \nThe skin of carrion. If it has not been tanned it is used at all. One \ndoes not pray it or sell it in the well-known position.  \n \n40.22e Skins of beasts of prey  \n \nThere is no harm in praying on the skins of beasts of prey \nwhen they have been slaughtered, and they can be sold.  \n \n40.22f Hair and wool  \n \nThe wool and hair of carrion are used as well as what is \nremoved from them while alive. We prefer that it be \nwashed. One does not use its feathers, horns, claws or \nteeth. It is disliked to use the tusks of elephants.  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is mandatory \nthat it be washed. What is meant by feathers is the quills of the \nfeathers of dead birds because the down is like hair in its purity \nby cutting. As for horns, they are not used at all absolutely, either \nthe tip or the base. This is when the elephants have not been \nslaughtered, although some take it to mean that it is forbidden.  \n \n40.22g Pigs  \n \nAll of a pig is forbidden, but there is an allowance to use its \nhair [bristles].  \n \nThe meat, fat, bones and skin of a pig are forbidden: eating it or \nusing it. The bristles are allowed because they are not impure in \nthe well-known position.   \n \n40.23 Forbidden drink  \n \n40.23a Its definition  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden drinking wine, a little or a \nlot. The drink of the Arabs at that time was date wine. The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) made it clear that if a \nlot of something intoxicates, then a little of it is unlawful. \nAny drink which drugs the mind and intoxicates it, \nwhatever it is, is considered to be 'wine'. Furthermore, \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The One made it \nunlawful to drink it made it unlawful to sell it.\"  \n \nIt says in the commentary of the 'Umda al-Ahkam that one of the \nshaikhs said, \"Even he puts the amount on the end of a needle \nonto his tongue, he receives the hadd.\" What was drunk at the \ntime of the prohibition was date wine. That was made by crushing \ndates and putting them in vessels and putting water on it and \nleaving it to ferment. A little of it is unlawful, even if it does not \nintoxicate.  \n \nWhat is meant is not everything which drugs the intellect, but \nwhat drugs it as a result of intoxicate, i.e. rapture and joy. In \nSahih Muslim, the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Every intoxicant is wine, and every wine is unlawful.\"  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade selling it. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in the Muwatta' that ibn \nAbbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said \"A man gave the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) a small water-skin of wine. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said to him, 'Don't you know that \nAllah azza wa jall has made it haram?' He said, 'No.' Then a man \nat his side whispered to him. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) asked what he had whispered and the man replied, 'I told \nhim to sell it.' The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, 'The \nOne who made drinking it haram has made selling it haram.' The \nman then opened the water-skins and poured out what was in \nthem.\"  \n \n40.34b Mixing drinks  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) also forbade mixing \ndrinks, whether they are mixed when they are set aside for \nfermentation or are mixed when they are drunk.  \n \nThis is a prohibition of drinking them because the prohibition is \nconnected to actions. There are two forms. One is ripening dates \nand raisins and then mixing them and putting them in one vessel, \npouring water on them and then leaving them to ferment. The \nsecond is when they are fermented on their own and then mixed \nfor drinking.  \n \n40.34c Fermentation vessels  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade storing/ fermenting juices \nin gourds or in pitch-lined containers.  \n \nThese are gourds which are lined with pitch which are quick to \ncause fermentation.  \n \n40.24 Other forbidden meat  \n \n40.24a Beasts of prey and domestic animals  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade eating every \nanimal with fangs and the meat of domestic donkeys. \nIncluded with donkeys is horsemeat and the meat of mules \nsince Allah azza wa jall says, \"both to ride and for \nadornment.\" (Holy Qur’an 16:8) None of these are \nslaughtered except wild asses.  \n \nIt is all beasts with fangs with which it attacks and which prey, \nlike tigers, panthers, and wolves. The fox is not a best of prey, \neven though it has fangs, because it does not attack or prey.  \n \nHorse meat and mules as well as donkeys are forbidden. That is \nbecause Allah azza wa jall mentioned flocks and said, \"There is \nwarmth for you in them, and various uses and some you eat.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 16:5) When He mentioned these, He only mentioned riding \nand adornment. That indicates that only that is permitted in \nthem. Slaughtering any of these, including beasts of prey, does not \nrender it eatable with the exception of wild asses.  \n \n40.24b Birds of prey  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in eating birds of prey and those \nwith talons.  \n \nAll such birds are eatable.  \n \nHashiyya: One does not eat bats because they are unclean.  \n \n40.25 Treatment of parents  \n \nIt is an obligation to be dutiful to one's parents, even if \nthey are evildoers or idolaters. One should speak kindly to \nthem and keep their company with correct politeness, but \nnot obey them in disobedience as Allah azza wa jall states. \nA believer must ask for forgiveness for his parents if they \nare believers.  \n \nWhether they are evildoers in action or creed. Part of correct \nbehavior is to lead the one who is blind to the church and to carry \nthem to it, and to give them what they spend in their festivals. He \nmust not raise his voice above their voice. He should be kind to \nthem in all that the Shari‟ah allows.  \n \nOne does not obey them in disobeying Allah azza wa jall as Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"If they endeavor to make you associate \nsomething with Me about which you have no knowledge do not \nobey them.\" (Holy Qur‟an 29:7) He must ask forgiveness because of \nthe words of Allah azza wa jall, \"Say, 'Lord, show mercy to them as \nthey did in looking after me when I was small.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n17:24) He does not ask forgiveness for them after their death if \nthey are unbelievers by consensus.  \n \n40.26 Treatment of Fellow Muslims  \n \n40.26a Love for fellow Muslims  \n \nA believer must always protect believers and give them \ngood advice. No one reaches the reality of faith until \"he \nloves for his brother believer what he loves for himself.\" \nThat is related from the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \nThis is friendship and showing love to them and not doing what \nwould alienate them, like envy and other such things. He must \ngive them good advice because that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said in a sound hadith, \"The din is good counsel,\" i.e. \nmost of the deen is good counsel, as he said, \"Hajj is 'Arafa.\" Those \npresent asked him, \"For whom, Rasulullah?\" He (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"To Allah azza wa jall, His Book, His Messenger, the \nleaders of the Muslims and their common folk.\"  \n \nGood counsel to Allah azza wa jall that you describe Him with \nwhat He describes Himself of necessary attributes and disconnect \nHim from what is not appropriate for Him. Good counsel for His \nBook is to recite it properly and obey its commands and avoid its \nprohibitions. Good advice for His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) is to believe in him and all that what he brought. Good \ncounsel for the leaders is to obey their commands and to follow the \nlaws which agree with the Shari‟ah in measures and weights and \nother things. Good counsel for the common is to guide them to \ntheir best interests and to treat them with truthfully.  \n \nHe mentions the extent of love which is to want for your fellow \nbeliever what you want for yourselves because it is the greatest \npillar and necessary for the maintenance of the pillars, and it is \nnot related that faith has any other pillars. The \"brother\" is \nmentioned to exclude the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) from \nthat because \"A person is not a believer until he loves the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) more than his wealth, his children \nand himself.\"  \n \n20.26b Maintaining ties with kin  \n \nHe must maintain ties with his relatives.  \n \nThat is every relative by lineage through mother or father.  \n \nHash: This maintaining of ties includes visiting relatives, \nspending on those who are in need, good words, asking about how \nthey are, overlooking their faults and helping them. It varies with \ndifferent relatives. What is meant are believing relatives, not \nunbelievers, except for dutifulness to parents. Visiting means \nthose who live nearby. Otherwise it is achieved through letters.  \n \n20.26c Duties owed to fellow Muslims  \n \nA believer must greet another believer when he meets him, \nvisit him when he is ill, wish him well when he sneezes, \nattend his funeral when he dies and defend him when he is \nabsent, publicly and in secret.  \n \nHe should initiate the greeting when he meets him. As for visiting \nthe one who is ill, part of the adab of that is that when he asks \nabout his condition, he shows him compassion and does not make \nhim despair. Wishing him well when he sneezes is to say to him, \n\"May Allah have mercy on you\" when he hears him praise Allah \nazza wa jall. He must attend his funeral: both the prayer and the \nburial. He should not slander him in his absence nor should he \nwish him ill.  \n \nHash: Visiting the ill is a fard kifayah. He should also make \nsupplication for the person who is ill and place his hand on his \nhand or his forehead to see how he is. He should not look at the \nprivate areas of the house or things one would normally not wish \nto be seen.  \n \n20.26d Impermissible shunning  \n \nOne does not shun his brother for more than three days. \nThe greeting ends the shunning, but he should not leave \noff speaking to him after the greeting.  \n \nShunning is not speaking to him or greeting him. Three days is \nbased on the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \"It \nis not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three \ndays.\" It is understood from this that shunning for three days is \nallowed, even if shunning is forbidden in general since that is \ndifficult because of human nature which is rarely free of anger. \nThe greeting, if he intends it, ends the shunning. If the other \nreturns it, they both end the shunning. Otherwise only the greeter \nends it. It is recommended that he be easy and continue to speak \nto him, because leaving it after giving the greeting is a bad \nopinion of him.  \n \n20.26e Permitted shunning  \n \nPermissible shunning is to shun someone with an \ninnovation or someone who openly commits major wrong \nactions provided he cannot punish him and is unable to \nadmonish \nhim \nor \nthe \nindividual \nwill \nnot \naccept \nadmonishment.  \n \nThis means a forbidden innovation like the Qadariyya who said \nthat good and evil come from man, not from Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nHash: Innovation is divided into forbidden and disliked. Forbidden \ninnovations also include saying that the Night Journey was only a \ndream and the Rafidiyya [extreme Shi'a] who reject Abu Bakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu).  \n \nSomeone who openly commits major wrong actions and makes no \nattempt to conceal them is like someone who drinks wine openly. \nThe place for shunning someone who openly commits wrong action \nis when he cannot punish him by the Shari‟ah by discipline and \nthe like, like types of ta'zir. If he cannot admonish him by the \ndifficulty to of mending him or if he will not accept it because of \nhis lack of sense and the like.  \n \n20.26f When talking about someone is not backbiting  \n \nIn these two cases, mentioning the situation of someone is \nnot backbiting nor is it backbiting when someone is \nconsulted about someone's character for the sake of \nmarriage or joint enterprise or the like, nor for the \npurpose of assessing the character of a witness and the \nlike.  \n \nIn these two cases, mentioning their state of iniquity in creed or \nlimb. When he is asked about them, he says about the innovator, \n\"So-and-so's dogma is false since it differs from the people of the \nSunnah.\" In respect of the one who openly commits wrong action, \nhe says, \"So-and-so persists in major wrong actions.\" It is \npermitted to mention what he displays but forbidden to mention \nhis other faults. This is not backbiting.  \n \nIf someone is asking about someone to marry, as when he says, \"I \nwant to marry the daughter of so-and-so but I do not know his \nstate,\" then he can mention his state to advise him and nothing \nmore. The same is true if the inquirer is planning on entering into \na partnership and the like and the person wants to know if he can \nbe trusted. The same holds for assessing the character of a \nwitness, or someone for which act as an Imam for the prayers. \nThey ask about him and he can inform them of his shortcoming. \nIndeed, he must do that. It is the same in dealing with the \ncharacter of a transmitter out of fear that he will attribute \nsomething to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) which he \ndid not say.  \n \n20.26g Noble character  \n \nIt is noble character to pardon the one who wrongs you \nand to give to the one who refused you and to join the one \nwho cut you off.  \n \nThat is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"My \nLord commanded me to connect those who cut me off, to give to \nthose who deprive me, and to pardon those who wrong me.\"  \n \n20.26h Four hadiths about good character  \n \nThe sum of good adab and its peak can be derived from \nfour hadiths.  \n \nThese are the qualities which amount to good character. They are \ncalled adab because they are learned. The peak is the acme of \ngood.  \n \n1. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Anyone \nwho believes in Allah azza wa jall and the Last Day should \nspeak well or be silent.\"  \n \nThe whole hadith is: \"Anyone who believes in Allah azza wa jall \nand the Last Day should not harm his neighbor. Anyone who \nbelieves in Allah azza wa jall and the Last Day should honor his \nguest. Anyone who believes in Allah azza wa jall and the Last Day \nshould speak well or be silent.\" He should speak good and be \nrewarded for it or be silent from an evil for which he will he \npunished.  \n \n2. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Part of the excellence of a \nperson's Islam is his leaving alone what does not concern \nhim.\"  \n \nIt is that in which there is no benefit for him either in this world \nor the Next.  \n \n3. He (alaihi salat wa salam) told the one who asked him for \nsuccinct advice, \"Do not get angry.\"  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) repeated it several times. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) meant that not keeping angry is \nan immense matter because anger has ruinous consequences in \nthis world and the next and not getting angry has benefits and \nfruits in the Next World which are beyond number because Allah \nazza wa jall created anger from the Fire and kneaded it in the clay \nof man. When one of his desires is opposed, the fire of anger is \nkindled in him and it bubbles up and the blood of his heart boils \nand spreads in the veins and rises to the top of his body like water \nin a pot and then it diffuses his face and eyes so that they become \nred since the skin is like glass, conveying what is behind it. The \naim of the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) was that he should \nnot do that which will provoke anger, not to stop something on \nwhich he is formed and which cannot be removed from him.  \n \n4. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"A believer wants for his \nbrother believer what he wants for himself.\"  \n \nIt is in Sahih al-Bukhari as, \"None of you will believe until he \nwants for his brother what he wants for himself,\" i.e. of obedience \nand permitted things.  \n \n40.27 Things one should not listen to  \n \nIt is not lawful for you to deliberately listen to all of a \nfalsehood nor to take pleasure in listening to the words of \na woman who is not lawful for you nor to listen to \nmusicians and singers.  \n \nFalsehood is like backbiting or action like listening to musical \ninstruments and their sound.  \n \nHash: According to Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \nlistening to it is not haram.  \n \nIt is not lawful for you enjoy the speech of a woman with whom \nyou cannot have intercourse, and so it would be permitted to enjoy \nthe words of a wife or slavegirl. It is not permitted to enjoy the \nvoice of a beardless youth. It is not lawful to listen to things like \nlutes and singing.  \n \n40.28 Recitation of the Holy Qur’an  \n \nIt is not permitted to recite the Holy Qur'an with \nquavering melodies as in the quavering used in singing. \nThe Mighty Book of Allah azza wa jall must be respected \nand recited with calm and gravity in a way which is \ncertain to please Allah azza wa jall and bring one near to \nHim with attention and understanding of that.  \n \nNor should one listen to it with musical tunes. It must be \nrespected and recited with stillness. One should not fiddle with his \nhand not look at what amuses him. A result of respect is that \nwhen he is about to break wind or yawns, he refrains from reciting \nuntil it is finished and the like. He must seek to please Allah by \nbeing in purity and facing qibla and sitting as a student before a \nmaster or standing in prayer. \"Bringing one near to Him\" is that \none is certain that Allah azza wa jall is near to the reciter and the \nreciter draws near the Master means that he is accepted. He \nshould pay attention to what he recites. When he recites an ayat \nof prohibition, he is certain of the prohibition, or one of command, \nhe is certain of what is commanded. This is one of the fruits of \nunderstanding.  \n \n40.29 Commanding the correct  \n \nIt is an obligation to command the correct and forbid the \nbad for everyone who has authority in the land and \nwhoever can achieve that. If he cannot do that, then it is \nwith his tongue. If he cannot do that, then it was with his \nheart.  \n \nThe correct is what Allah azza wa jall and His Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) have commanded and the bad is what \nAllah azza wa jall and His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nhave forbidden. If someone has authority, like a ruler, he should \nput it right. If he cannot change it with his hand, then with his \ntongue. Changing it with the heart is that when he sees something \nbad he says to himself. \"If I had the power to change it, I would do \nso.\" When he sees something correct being abandoned, he says in \nhimself, \"If I had the power to command it, I would do so.\" He \nlikes someone who does what is correct and dislikes someone who \ndoes what is objectionable.  \n \n40.30 Right Intention  \n \nIt is an obligation for every believer to desire the Noble \nFace of Allah azza wa jall by every word and deed. If \nsomeone desires other than Allah azza wa jall in that, his \naction is not accepted. Showing off is lesser shirk.  \n \nThe action must be meant for the sake of Allah azza wa jall, not \nfor reputation or showing off. There are two levels in the \nintention: the perfect is not to intend the Garden or the Fire. The \nimperfect is to intend to enter the Garden and be far from the \nFire. If the word or action is mean for other than Allah azza wa \njall, it is not accepted. Showing off, which is to do an action which \nmay be an act of devotion, wanting people to see it, although that \ncan be in other things which are not acts of devotion, like dressing, \nthat is lesser shirk since Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \ngreatest thing I fear for you is lesser shirk.\" They asked, \n\"Rasulullah, what is lesser shirk?\" \"Showing off,\" he (alaihi salat \nwa salam) replied.  \n \n40.31 Repentance [Tauba]  \n \n40.31a. Its obligatory nature  \n \nRepentance from every wrong action and not persisting in \nit is an obligation. Persisting in it is to continue in the \nwrong action and intend to return to it.  \n \nIt is regret for what he misses and leaving the wrong action \nimmediately with the intention not to return to it. \"Not persisting\" \nis repetition because repentance is not valid when one persists in \nthe wrong action.  \n \n40.31b Part of what repentance requires  \n \nPart of repentance is to restore wrongs and avoid \nforbidden things and to intend to not revert to the wrong \naction.  \n \nRestoring wrongs to their people is by giving them to them, if that \nconsists of property, or returning them to the person's heir if the \nwronged person is no longer alive. If there are no heirs, then he \ngives it as sadaqa to someone wronged. If it is honor, like slander, \nrectifies that about the slandered. It is also a precondition to avoid \nforbidden things and not to return to them.  \n \n40.31c Asking forgiveness  \n \nThe one who repents should ask forgiveness of his Lord \nand hope for His mercy and fear His punishment while \nremembering His blessings to him. He should thank Him \nfor His favor to him by actions, meaning by obligations, \nand by not doing what is disliked to do, He should draw \nnear to Allah azza wa jall by doing voluntary acts of good \nwhich are feasible for him.  \n \nAsking forgiveness is one of the pillars of repentance. He should \nact, even if it is a little. This is like the prayer since it is confirmed \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) reported that Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"My slave continues to draw near to Me with \nsupererogatory actions until I love him. When I love him, I become \nhis hearing with which he hears, his sight by which he sees, his \nhand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. If he \nasks of Me, I give to him. If he seeks refuge with Me, I give him \nrefuge.\"  \n \n40.312d Missed obligations  \n \nHe should make up any obligations which he missed \nimmediately, asking Allah azza wa jall to accept them and \nturning to Him in repentance for missing them.  \n \nThis is like the prayer. They are immediately obligatory. He \nshould hope that Allah azza wa jall will accept them and pardon \nhim.  \n \nHash: This is if it is not too difficult for him and then he makes \nthem up as best he can. He cannot do any supererogatory actions \nuntil he has made up the obligatory, with the exception of stressed \nSunnah like the witr, Ids and Fajr.  \n \n40.31e Seeking Allah azza wa jall's help  \n \nHe should seek refuge in Allah azza wa jall when he finds it \ndifficult to direct himself or is confused about what to do. \nHe should be certain that Allah azza wa jall can reform his \nstate, grant him success, and direct him. He should not \nabandon that because of any good or ugliness in him and \nhe must never despair of the mercy of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nWhat he seeks is success in going straight in obedience to Allah \nazza wa jall. He should not cease seeking refuge and certainty \naccording to his state. The good is obedience and the ugliness is \ndisobedience. Wrong action should not prevent him from that \nbecause Allah azza wa jall says, \"Allah loves those who repent.\" \nTawwab means the one who, whenever he commits a wrong \naction, repents.  \n \n40.32 Reflection  \n \nReflection on the command of Allah azza wa jall is the key \nof worship. So seek help by remembering death and \nreflecting on what comes after it, the blessings of your \nLord to You, and his deferring you while punishing others \nfor their wrong actions. Reflect on your past wrong actions \nand the outcome of your affair and how suddenly and soon \nyour death will come.  \n \nThe command of Allah azza wa jall means His creation because \nwhen you reflect on the products of the Creator, you know the \nnecessity of His existence, the perfection of His power and the \nreality of his Lordship, and so must worship Him. Looking at the \ncreation of Allah azza wa jall is, as the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, the key to worship.  \n \nSeek help against yourself is also in reflecting on death because \ndeath is harder than what went before and what comes after it is \nworse than that. Also seek help against it by reflecting on the \nblessing of your Lord since when you reflect on His blessings to \nyou, you are too shy to commit wrong actions. Also seek help in \nreflecting on the end of your business since you do not know what \nthe seal will be. Your term will come soon, i.e. the end may be at \nthe end of the day or sooner because that makes obedience is easy \nand lessens hopes and desire. When you reflect on death, that is \npreparation for it, for when comes suddenly regret will be of no \nuse, O Ever-Kind, be kind to us! There is no strength and no \npower except by You! May Allah bless our master Muhammad and \nhis family and Companions and grant them peace.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 41: The Natural Form (Fitra): \nCircumcision, Shaving the Hair, Dress, \nCovering the Private parts and the Like \n \n \n \n \n \nThe fitra refers to the qualities by which a person is complete so \nthat he has the best of qualities in his form and demeanor. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) deals with what is commanded and \nforbidden under this topic, like forms and images.  \n \n41.1 The fitra (natural form)  \n \nFive things are part of the fitra: 1) trimming the mustache, \nwhich is the curve which is the hair which curls around \nthe lips, not shaving off the mustache completely, and \nAllah knows best, 2) trimming the nails, 3) plucking out the \nhair of the armpits, 4) shaving pubic hair, – and there is \nnothing wrong in shaving the hair off the rest of the body. \n5) Circumcision is a Sunnah for men and honorable for \nwomen.  \n \n1. Trimming the mustache, i.e. the hair which grows over the lip, \nmeaning that which comes down over the lip. This is the Sunnah \nfor shortening it, but it is not removed completely. \n  \n2.  Trimming the nails for men and women.  \n \n3.  Plucking out the hair of the armpits which is Sunnah for men \nand women.  \n \n4.  Shaving pubic hair which is Sunnah for men and women. It is \ndisliked to pluck out the hair for men and women because that \nweakens the area. It is permitted to use a depilatory. It is \npermitted to shave the hair on the hands and feet, and the rest \nof the body other than the head and beard. It appears it is \npermissible for men and mandatory for women to remove that \nwhose removal entails beauty, because not doing it is \nmutilation.  \n \nHashiyya: Shaving is best because that was the Sunnah of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that removing other bodily hair is \neither permissible or Sunnah for men. Women should remove \nextra hair for beauty, even the hair of a beard if she grows one. \nShe must let hair remain whose existence is part of beauty and so \nshe is forbidden to shave her head. There is some disagreement \nabout a man shaving his head. Some say that it is permitted for \nsomeone who wears a turban and disliked for the one who does not \nwear a turban.  \n \n5.  Circumcision is Sunnah for men, adult or not adult, but the \nadult should do it to himself so as not to expose his private \nparts. It is removal of the foreskin. It is a stressed Sunnah.  \n \n41.2 Beards  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  commanded that \nthe beard be left and allowed to become thick without \nbeing cut off. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nthere is nothing wrong is shortening it if it becomes too \nlong. Many Companions and Tabi'un said that.  \n \nIt recommended to remove some of it if it too long. There is no \nlimit to what is taken of it if one leaves it relatively full.  \n \n41.3 Dying hair  \n \nIt is disliked to dye the hair black, but not forbidden. \nThere is nothing wrong is using henna and katam.  \n \nIt is a prohibition for the sake of abstemiousness. This is \nparticular ruling in relation to selling and jihad. It is forbidden in \nselling (i.e. to make a slave appear younger), but there is a reward \nfor doing it in jihad to confuse the youthful enemy. There is \nnothing wrong with henna or katam, which makes the hair yellow. \nHenna makes it red. It is recommended or permissible, more likely \nthe later.  \n \n41.4a The prohibition of using gold for men  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade men to \nwear silk and gold or iron rings. There is nothing wrong in \nusing silver to decorate a seal ring, a sword or a copy of \nthe Holy Qur'an, but that should not be used in bridles, \nsaddles, knives or in other such things.  \n \nHe means that the ring is made of silver, as it states in the two \nSahih collections that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nhad a silver ring made and wore it on his hand and then Abu Bakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) wore it after him. Then 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) wore it and then 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu), until it fell \ninto the well of Arish. 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) searched for it \nand drained the well for three days but did not find it. It indicates \nthat the khalifate was represented by the ring. Engraved on it was \n\"Muhammad is the Rasulullah.\" Silver is not used on weapons of \nwar in general.  \n \nHash: It is permitted to use silver or gold on swords. It is said that \nthat is because it will alarm the enemy. It is used on copies of the \nHoly Qur'an to show esteem for it. The permission to use silver on \nswords is for a man's sword. It is not used on a woman's sword, \neven if she uses it for jihad.  \n \n41.4b Women's use  \n \nWomen can wear gold rings, but he (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade them wearing iron rings.  \n \nIt is preferred that they use silver. Iron is forbidden for both men \nand women.  \n \n41.4c Manner of wearing rings  \n \nWhat is preferred, according to what is reported about \nrings, is that they are worn on left hand, since the right \nhand is used for taking things. A person takes something \nwith the right hand and puts it into the left.  \n \nThis is the majority position, including that of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). It is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) wore his ring on the little finger of the left hand. \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) turned the face towards his  palm. \nWhen he (alaihi salat wa salam) did istinja', he removed it and he \nremoved it when he went to the lavatory. Also the left hand is \nfurther from pride.  \n \n41.4d Khazz [fabric containing silk]  \n \nThere is disagreement about wearing khazz. Some permit \nit and others dislike it. The same is true about silk badges \non garments except for a thin strip.  \n \nKhazz is cloth whose warp is of wool, cotton or linen and its woof \nis silk. The first position is in the Qamus while Shaikh ibn Rushd \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) takes the second position. There is a third \nthat is unlawful. Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It is \nthe apparent position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) by the \nwords of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) on the robe of \n'Urtarid which was mixed with silk and he wore it and he said, \n\"This is one who has no portion in the Next World.\" Badges are \nless than a finger in length.  \n \n41.5 Clothing  \n \n41.5a Women's dress  \n \nWhen women go out, they should not wear thin clothing \nwhich lets their shape be seen.  \n \nThat which lets the attributes of body be seen, like breast and rear \nend. In their house with they husbands, they can wear such \nclothes.  \n \n41.5b Arrogance in dress  \n \nA man should not drag his waist-wrapper out of pride nor \nhis garment out of arrogance. His garment should reach \nthe ankles, as that is cleaner for the garment and shows \nmore godfearing.  \n \nIn this case, the dragging originates from arrogance. The same \nwould apply to a woman if she did it out of arrogance. It shows \nmore taqwa for it to reach the ankles because he guards against \npride, and vanity. Pride refers to a person regarding himself as \nperfect while forgetting the blessing of Allah azza wa jall and the \nvanity to thinking little of others, Pride is more specific than \nvanity.  \n \n41.5c Samma'  \n \nIt is forbidden to wear a samma' garment over nothing \nelse. It is lifted up by the arm on one side and hangs down \non the other. That is when there is nothing under it. There \nis disagreement about when there is garment under it.  \n \nLike wearing it over a waist-wrapper. It is explained in the hadith \nof Abu Sa‟id (radhi‟Allahu anhu) that a man puts his garment on \none of his shoulders so that his side shows. Linguists explain it as \na man wearing a garment in which he is wrapped and there is no \nway out for his hand. When he wants to put his hand out, his \nnakedness shows. The Qamus says that it means he brings the \ngarment from his right side over his left hand and left shoulder, \nand then brings it back again over his right hand and shoulder \nand covers them all. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) has two \npositions about when it is worn over a garment. One is that it is \nforbidden, taking the hadith literally, and the other that it is \npermitted since the legal cause does not exist, which is avoiding \nexposure of the private parts.  \n \n41.6 Covering the private parts  \n \n41.6a Covering the private parts is obligatory  \n \nOne is commanded to cover the private parts. The waist-\nwrapper of a believer reaches mid-calf.  \n \nTo hide the private parts from people's eyes is mandatory by \nconsensus, and recommended in private in the well-known \nposition. There is also a position that it is obligatory in private. \nThe man's waist-wrapper should reach mid-calf since the \nMuwatta' reported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"The waist-wrapper of a Muslim should reach his mid-calves, \nand there is no harm - i.e. there is nothing wrong - in what is \nbetween that and the ankles. Anything lower than the ankles will \nin the Fire. Allah azza wa jall will not look at anyone who drags \nhis wrapper out of pride.\"  \n \n41.6b The thigh  \n \nThe thigh is a private part, but not an intrinsic private \npart.  \n \nWhat is between the thigh and the hip is a private part. This \nmeans it is not an actual private part, and the strictest position \nthat it is disliked to show it with other than close friends and \nrelations is unlikely because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) had his thigh uncovered with Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) and 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu). In Sahih Muslim, 'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu anha) reported that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) was reclining in his house with his thighs and calves \nuncovered. Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked for permission to \nenter and he (alaihi salat wa salam) gave him permission while he \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was like that. He spoke and then 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked for permission and he gave him \npermission while he (alaihi salat wa salam) was like that and he \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) talked with him. Then 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) asked for permission and the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) sat up and straightened his garment. He (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) entered and spoke with him (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nthen \nleft. \n'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu \nanha) \nsaid, \n\"Abu \nBakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) entered and you were not concerned. 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) entered and you were not concerned, \n(meaning you did not worry and cover your thighs). Then 'Uthman \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) entered and you sat up and straightened your \ngarment.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Should I not be modest \nbefore a man before whom the angels are modest?\" Modesty is a \nvirtue.  \n \n41.6c Bathhouses  \n \nA man should not enter the bathhouse without wearing a \nwaist wrapper. A woman should only enter it for a reason. \nTwo men or two women should not be together under a \nsingle cover.  \n \nHash: The ruling for men is when there are other people present. \nIf the bathhouse is empty, then it is permitted without one.  \n \nA reason for a woman to enter is like illness or lochia, not for \nmenstruation or janaba.  \n \nHash: Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The lands of the non-Arabs \nwill be opened to you via conquest and you will find houses in \nthem called bathhouses. Men should only enter them with a waist \nwrapper and forbid women to enter them unless they are ill or \nbleeding after childbirth.\" Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays it is disliked for them and is less than an actual prohibition.  \n \nThe rule about the single cover or cloth is when their private parts \nare not covered. This is a prohibition, whether they are relatives \nor not based on what Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) related \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"A man should \nnot look at another man's private parts nor a woman at another \nwoman's private parts. Two men should not lie naked under the \nsame cover nor two women under the same cover.\"  \n \n41.7 Women going out and music  \n \n41.7a Women going out  \n \nA woman should not go out unless she is covered for what \nshe must do in being present at the death of her parents or \nrelatives or the like which is permitted.  \n \nLike funerals and weddings.  \n \n41.7b Unacceptable gatherings  \n \nFurthermore she should not attend a funeral where there \nare women wailer’s or gatherings with playing of flutes or \nlutes or similar instruments, except for the tambourine in \nweddings. There is disagreement about kabar drums.  \n \nIt is not permitted to attend such gatherings. The kabar is a small \ndrum with a skin on one side. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) permitted it and others forbid it.  \n \n41.8 Seeing Women  \n \nA man should not be alone with a woman for whom he is \nnot a mahram. There is no harm in him seeing a woman for \nsome reason like identifying her or the like of that, or \nwhen he proposes marriage to her. As a woman who does \nnot provoke desire because of her age, there is nothing \nwrong in him seeing her face in any case.  \n \nHe means a young woman who is not related to him since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade that, saying that Shaitan \nis the third of them. He can see her for a legitimate reason. The \n\"like\" includes a doctor looking at her.  \n \n41.9 Hair extensions and tattoos  \n \nWomen are forbidden to add someone else's hair to their \nown or to tattoo themselves.  \n \nSince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah azza \nwa jall has cursed anyone who joins hair together and the person \nto whose hair it is joined, women who tattoo and are tattooed, \nwomen who pluck their eyebrows, and women who file their teeth \nto make gaps for beauty, altering Allah azza wa jall's creation!\" \nPlucking is to remove the hair of the eyebrows until they become \nthin for cosmetic reasons, and making gaps is to file the teeth so \nthey are far apart. It is understood that the prohibition is when it \nis done for beauty. When it is done for treatment or a defect, there \nis no harm in it.  \n \n41.10 Putting on footwear  \n \nWhen putting on a sock or sandal, begin with the right and \nwhen removing it, begin with the left. There is nothing \nwrong in putting on sandals while standing. It is disliked \nto walk in only one sandal.  \n \nThis is a recommendation. One can put them on sitting down or \nstanding, either being preferred. It is disliked to walk in only one \nsandal because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nthat.  \n \n41.11 Images  \n \nIt is disliked to make images on beds, tents, walls and \nrings. Designs on clothing is not part of that but it is better \nnot to do it.  \n \nThese are images of animals. Tents includes a cloth put over a \nhowdah.  \n \n \nChapter 42: Eating and Drinking \n \n \nThis chapter is about the adab of eating and drinking.  \n \n42.1 Invocation before and afterwards  \n \nWhen you eat or drink, it is mandatory for you to say, \"In \nthe name of Allah\" - \"Bismillah\" and to take the food using \nyour right hand. When you finish, you should say, \"Praise \nbe to Allah\" - \"Alhamdulillah.\"  \n \nThis is the Sunnah, to say \"In the Name of Allah,\" aloud and not \nadd \"the All-Merciful, Most Merciful\". It is recommended to use \nthe right hand for eating and drinking. After eating, one says, \n\"Alhamdulillah\" silently.  \n \nHashiyya: If one forgets to say \"In the Name of Allah\" when he \nbegins, then when he finishes, he says, \"In the Name of Allah, the \nfirst of it and the last of it.\" It is recommended to say it aloud to \nremind others who might forget it and to instruct someone who \ndoes not know that. One does not add \"the All-Merciful, Most \nMerciful\" because chewing is punishment, and punishment is not \ncombined with mercy, just as one does not add that when \nslaughtering an animal. Some, however, like Shaikh Abu Mahdi \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nthe \nShaikh \nof \nShaikh \nibn \nNaji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), prefer to add that.  \n \nOne is recommended to say \"Alhamdulillah\" silently so as not to \nembarrass someone who is eating and is not full.  \n \n42.2 Eating manners  \n \n42.2a Licking the hand  \n \nIt is good to lick your hand before wiping it.  \n \nOne version says \"fingers\" since it says in Muslim that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to lick his hand before \nwiping it. One eats with three fingers. \n \nHash: Qadi 'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"(Eating with fingers \nis) part of the adab and Sunnah of eating. Eating with more than \nthem is greed and bad manners unless more are needed because of \nthe fineness of the food.  \n \n42.2b Thirds  \n \nThe manners of eating include leaving a third of your \nstomach for food, a third for drink and a third for breath.  \n \nSo when someone eats a lot of food, he has no space for breathing.  \n \n42.2c Eating from in front of one  \n \nIf you are eating with others, you eat from what is in front \nof you.  \n \nWhen you are eating with other than your family, you eat from \nwhat is in front of you because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) commanded that.  \n \n42.2d Finishing one bite before taking another  \n \nDo not take another bite until you have finished the \nprevious one.  \n \nUntil you have swallowed it so that you are not greedy for food \nand so that you do not choke and become embarrassed. Part of the \nproper adab is that you eat small morsels and take your time \nwhile eating, even if that is not your habit.  \n \n42.2e Drinking  \n \nDo not breathe into the vessel while you are drinking. \nTake the cup away from your mouth and then return it if \nyou wish, Do not drink in gulps, but sip it.  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade breathing into \nthe vessel. It is permitted to drink in one gulp. That is the position \nof Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is said, however, that it is \ndisliked, because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"When one of you drinks, he should take three breaths. It is more \nhealthy and satisfying.  \n \n42.2f Chewing properly  \n \nChew your food properly before swallowing it.  \n \nThat is better for enjoyment and for digestion.  \n \n42.2g Cleaning the mouth after eating  \n \nClean your mouth after eating. It is good to wash your \nhands of grease and milk. It is good to pick out any food \nbetween your teeth.  \n \nClean your mouth after eating by rinsing and using the siwak to \nprevent bad breath. It is good to wash your hands after licking it \nto remove grease and fat and milk. That is recommended. One \nremoves food from between the teeth because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) commanded that.  \n \n42.2h Not eating with the left hand  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade eating or \ndrinking with the left hand.  \n \nThat is because Shaitan eats and drinks with his left hand.  \n \n42.2i Passing to the right  \n \nWhen you drink, you pass it to the one on your right.  \n \nThat is based on the report is the Muwatta' that the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was given some milk mixed with water. \nThere was a bedouin to his right and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) to his (alaihi salat wa salam) left. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) drank and then gave it to the bedouin, saying, \n\"The right and then to the right.\"  \n \n42.2j Not blowing on food or drink  \n \nIt is forbidden to blow on food or drink or on a book, or to \ndrink from a gold or silver vessel.  \n \nWhat is meant by book is a book of fiqh or hadith. In the case of \nfood or drink, it is to protect it from dirt, and it is for respect in the \ncase of books.  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) in the two Sahih \ncollections, said, \"Do not drink or eat from a gold or silver vessel \nnor their plates They have them in this world and you have it in \nthe Next World,\" meaning the unbelievers.  \n \n42.2k One can drink standing  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in drinking standing up.  \n \nAs it is related in at-Tirmidhi that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) used to drink both standing up and sitting down, and \n'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) also \ndid that. That is the position of the fuqaha'.  \n \n42.2l Not entering a mosque after eating garlic  \n \nIt is not permitted for someone who has eaten raw leeks, \ngarlic or onions to enter a mosque.  \n \nIt is disliked because Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nheard from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that more than one \npreferred \nthat \nthat \nis \nprohibited. \nAbdullah \nibn \n'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) took the works of the author to mean that.  \n \n42.2m Not eating reclining  \n \nIt is disliked to eat reclining.  \n \nIt is to lean on one's left side on the left leg and rest on the left \nelbow with the right thigh upright.  \n \n42.2n Not eating from the top  \n \nIt is disliked to start eating from the top of tharid (bread \nsoaked in broth).  \n \nSince it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwas brought a bowl of tharid and said, \"Eat from its sides and do \nnot eat from its middle. The blessing descends on the middle.\"  \n \n42.2o Eating two dates at the same time  \n \nIt is forbidden to eat to two dates at the same time, but it is \nsaid that this prohibition only applies to co-owners of the \ndates they are eating. There is nothing wrong in doing that \nwith your own family or people you are feeding.  \n \nThe prohibition is one of dislike either because of being bad \nmanners or because of self appropriation. If the people are \npartners in the dates, then it is a forbidden. He is permitted to do \nthat in his own family because it is his, or with those he is feeding \nif the reason is appropriation. If it is bad manners, the prohibition \nremains.  \n \n42.2p When there are different fruits on the plate  \n \nWhen eating dates and other fruits, there is nothing wrong \nin reaching your hand around the dish to eat what you \nwant of them.  \n \nWhen, for instance, there are dates and raisins. Then you can \nreach to take them wherever they are on the plate. That is \nreported in the Sunnah.  \n \n42.3 Washing the hands  \n \n42.3a Washing the hands before eating  \n \nWashing one's hands before eating is not Sunnah unless \nthey are dirty.  \n \nIndeed, it is disliked if they are clean according to the well-known \nposition of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). One does not act by \nhis (alaihi salat wa salam) words, \"Washing before eating removes \npoverty and after it removes pains.\" It is not the action of the \npeople of Madina, i.e. their action is put before the hadith, even if \nthe hadith is sound. That is because the fact that their action was \ncontrary to the hadith must oblige that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) acted differently which indicates that it was \nabrogated. If, however, they are dirty, they are washed to honor \nthe food.  \n \n42.3b After eating  \n \nAfter eating, a person should wash his hands and mouth \nfree of grease and rinse the milk from his mouth.  \n \nShaikh Yusuf ibn Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that this is a \nruling particular to milk because it has fat and that is \nstrengthened by the hadith in which the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) drank milk and then called for water and washed \nhis mouth. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"It has fat.\"  \n \n42.3b Not using foodstuff for cleaning the hands  \n \nIt is disapproved to clean one's hands with food or any \nbean flour or even the chaff of grain, but there is \ndisagreement about the latter.  \n \nThe disagreement is about whether it is permitted or disliked.  \n \n42.4 Going to a wedding feast  \n \nIf you are invited to a wedding feast, you must go unless \nthere is well-known or objectionable entertainment there. \nIt is up to you whether you eat. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) stated that it is allowed not to go if it is too \ncrowded.  \n \nIt is said that this is a recommendation and it is said that it is an \nobligation. It is obliged to accept the invitation when one is \nspecifically invited. He adds more preconditions: that there are \nnot forbidden musical instruments there and disliked things like \nmen and women mixing and silk couches.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 43: Rulings Concerning Speech \n \n \nGreetings, Asking Permission to Enter, Conversation, \nRecitation, Supplication, Dhikr'Allah, and Travel  \n \n43.1 Greeting  \n \n43.1a The Form of the Greeting  \n \nReturning a greeting is mandatory. Initiating it is Sunnah \nand desirable. The form of the greeting is that a man says, \n\"Peace be upon you,\" [as-salamu 'alaikum] and the reply is, \n\"And upon you peace,\" [wa 'alaikum salam] or \"Peace be \nupon you,\" [salamu 'alaikum] as was said to him.  \n \nA fuller greeting which ends with blessing is that you say \nin reply, \"On upon you peace and the mercy of Allah and its \nblessings.\" [wa 'alaikum-salamu wa rahmatu'llahi wa \nbarakatuh] Do not say in your answer, 'The peace of Allah \nbe upon you.\" [salam'Allah 'alaik]  \n \nReturning the greeting is a fard kifayah in the well-known \nposition. Initiating it is a Sunnah kifayah and is stressed. The \nplural form is used whether it is one or more people greeted, \nthereby including the guardian angels. Shaikh ibn Rushd \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the best is to greet with as-salamu \n'alaikum and to reply with wa 'alaikum-salam.  \n \nThe optimum reply is wa 'alaikum-salamu wa rahmatu'llahi wa \nbarakatuh, and it is innovation and excess to add more than that.  \n \nThe last form (salam’Allah 'alaik) is not used because it is not \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used it and \nit is not transmitted from the Salaf.  \n \n43.1b One of a group is enough  \n \nIf one of a group makes the greeting, that suffices for all of \nthem. The same applies when one of them returns the \ngreeting.  \n \nBecause it is part of the Sunnah al-kifayah.  \n \n43.1c Who greets whom  \n \nSomeone riding greets someone walking, and someone \nwalking greets someone sitting.  \n \nThis is based on the command of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam).  \n \n43.1d Shaking hands  \n \nShaking hands is good. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ndisliked embracing, but Shaikh ibn 'Uyayna (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) allowed it.  \n \nIt is recommended according to the well-known position. There is \na counter transmission of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) from \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is disliked.  \n \nHash: Shaking hands is recommended based on what the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) is reported as saying in the \nMuwatta': \"Shake hands and rancor will disappear. Give presents \nto each other and you will love each other and enmity will \ndisappear.\"  \n \nShaikh Sufyan ibn Uyayna (rahmatullahi alaihi) was one of the \ngreat people of knowledge and excellence.  \n \n43.1e Embracing and kissing the hand  \n \nImam \nMalik \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \ndisliked \nkissing \nanother's hand and did not accept what is related about it.  \n \nThis is kissing the hand of another person, whether it is a scholar, \nmaster or father. It is the apparent meaning of the text of the \npeople of the School because it is the action of the non-Arabs \nwhich can lead to pride and self-importance. Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did not accept the hadiths related about it. \nOne is that when the delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays  came to the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) they went to kiss his hands and \nfeet. It is sahih. Another is Sa'd ibn Malik (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nkissing the hand of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). \n \nHash: If Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) criticism of the \nhadiths was based on transmission, he was the Imam in hadith. If \nit is fiqh, it is based on ijtihad. Shaikh ibn Battal (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), a Maliki Imam, says that it is disliked to kiss the hands of \ntyrants, but it is permitted to kiss the hand of a parent or \nrighteous man whose barakah is hoped for.  \n \n43.1f Greeting People of the Book  \n \nYou should not initiate the greeting to a Jew or Christian. \nIf a Muslim inadvertently greets a dhimmi, he does take it \nback. If a Jew or Christian greets a Muslim, he should \nanswer, \"On you ('alaik).\" It is also said that one may \nanswer with \"And on you silam.\" \"Silam\" means a stone. \nThat used to be said.  \n \nIt is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade initiating it. This prohibition is one of dislike. If someone \ngreets one of them, thinking he is a Muslim, he does not seek the \nreply by saying something like, \"I greeted you thinking that you \nwere a Muslim. If I had known that you were an unbeliever, I \nwould not have greeted you. Return to me the greeting I gave \nyou.\" When he replies to their greeting, he says, \"On you\" without \nthe waw so that it is against him.  \n \n43.2 Asking permission to enter and visiting the sick  \n \n43.2a Asking permission to enter  \n \nAsking permission to enter people's houses is mandatory. \nDo not enter a house where someone is present without \nasking his permission three times. If you are given \npermission, enter. Otherwise, go away,  \n \nIt is a mandatory obligation because Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"When your children reach puberty, they should ask permission to \nenter.\" Whoever abandons that disobeys Allah azza wa jall and \nthe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam). It makes no difference \nwhether the house is locked or unlocked, Asking three times is the \nlimit, whether a mahram or someone whose private parts it is not \nlawful to look at him, as opposed to a wife or slavegirl. \n \nHash: This does not include public places like mosques, \nbathhouses, hotels, and the much-frequented houses of scholars, \nqadis and doctors (not their private dwellings, but areas which are \nmore public.  \n \nThe form of asking permission is to say, \"May I enter?\"  \n \n43.2b Visiting the sick  \n \nIt is recommended to visit the sick.  \n \nThis was already mentioned earlier and is out of place.  \n \n43.3 Whispering to the exclusion of a person  \n \n43.3a Not whispering to the exclusion of another person  \n \nTwo people should not converse together to the exclusion \nof a third. Nor may a larger group do that while excluding \none of them. It is also said that that they must not do that \nexcept with his permission.  \n \nThis is whether it is done while resident or on a journey.  \n \n43.3b. Not shunning  \n \nShunning people was already mentioned in an earlier \nChapter [Chapter 40].  \n \n43.4 Dhikr  \n \nMu'adh ibn Jabal (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"No action of a \nhuman being is more likely to save him from the \npunishment of Allah azza wa jall than Dhikr’Allah.\" 'Umar \n[ibn al-Khattab] (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Better than the \nremembrance of Allah azza wa jall on the tongue is the \nremembrance of Allah azza wa jall by obeying His \ncommands and prohibitions.\"  \n \nRegarding Mu'adh ibn Jabal (radhi‟Allahu anhu) the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The one with the most knowledge of \nthe halal and haram is Mu'adh ibn Jabal.\" Mu'adh's (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) statement can refer to dhikr by the tongue or by the heart. \nThe perfect dhikr is that which is with the heart and tongue both. \n'Umar's (radhi‟Allahu anhu) statement does not contradict the fact \nthat the most perfect dhikr, is all of them.  \n \nDhikr of the heart has two types. The most majestic is reflection \non the immensity of Allah azza wa jall and His majesty, might and \nHis signs in the Heaven and the earth. Then there is remembering \nwith the heart in the command and prohibition and obeying what \nHe commanded and avoiding what He forbade.  \n \n43.5 Supplications  \n \n43.5a A supplication for the morning and evening  \n \nOne of the supplications of the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) morning and night was, \"O Allah, by You we start the \nday and by You we end it, and by You we live and by You \nwe die.\"  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) also used to add in the morning, \n\"To You is the gathering,\" and in the evening, \"To You is the \nreturn.\"  \n \nThis is transmitted in the four Sunan collections: at-Tirmidhi, Abu \nDawud, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.  \n \n43.5b Another supplication  \n \nAlso related in that is: \"O Rabb, grant me a portion in every \nblessing with Your slaves who have the greatest portion \nwith You which You distribute on this day and in \nafterwards: in the light by which You guide, the mercy \nwhich You spread, the provision which you expand, harm \nwhich you remove, wrong actions which You forgive, \nhardship which you drive away, temptation which You \navert and pardon which You bestow by Your mercy. You \nhave power over all things.\"  \n \nIt is related that it is a marfu' hadith. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) stated that. It is related that it was part of \nwhat Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said. The author's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) style seems to indicate the later.  \n \n43.6 A supplication before going to sleep  \n \nPart of his (alaihi salat wa salam) supplication when he went \nto sleep was that he put his right hand under his right \ncheek and his left hand on his left thigh and then said, 'O \nAllah, in Your Name I have lain down and in Your Name I \nwill rise. O Allah, if You keep my self, then forgive it. If You \nrelease it, then guard it as You guard the righteous among \nYour slaves. O Allah, I have surrendered myself to You and \nI commend myself to You. I entrust my affair with You and \nhave turned my face to You fearing You and desiring You. \nThere is no where to flee or refuge from You except to You. \nI ask for your forgiveness and I turn to You. I have \nbelieved in Your Book which You sent down and in your \nProphet whom You sent, so forgive me what I did in the \npast and will do in the future, what I conceal and what I \nmake public. You are my Lord. There is no god but You. My \nLord, protect me from Your punishment on the Day You \nresurrect Your slaves.\"  \n \n43.7 A supplication when going out  \n \nIt is related that when he left the house, he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"O Allah, I seek refuge with You from \nmisguiding or being misguided, from slipping up or \nmaking others slip, or wronging or being wronged, from \nbeing ignorant or being treated ignorantly.\"  \n \nThis is in the four Sunan Collections.  \n \n43.8 A supplication after the prayer  \n \nIt is related that he (alaihi salat wa salam) said after every \nprayer one should say, \"Subhan’Allah\" 33 times, \"Allahu \nAkbar\" 33 times and \"Alhamdulillah\" 33 times and end the \nhundred with \"There is no god but Allah alone with no \npartner. His is the kingdom and praise is His and He has \npower over all things.\"  \n \nThis is after every obligatory prayer.  \n \n43.9 A supplication after going to the lavatory  \n \nAfter going to the lavatory, you say, \"Praise be to Allah who \nprovided me with its pleasure and removed from me its \ndiscomfort and let its nutrition remain in my body.\"  \n \nThis is related from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). This \nhadith is mursal. The version in the Sahih Collections, \"Praise be \nto Allah who removed harm from me and protected me from \naffliction.\" In the Sahih collections, when the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) entered the lavatory, he (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"O Allah, I seek refuge with you from foulness and the foul \nones [Shaitan‟s].\"  \n \n43.10 Supplications against danger  \n \n43.10a Supplication against danger  \n \nYou should seek protection from everything you fear and \nwhen you camp in a place or sit in a place or sleep \nsomewhere, saying, \"I seek refuge with the complete words \nof Allah from the evil of what He created.\"  \n \nAccording to Muslim, you repeat this three times. \"The complete \nwords of Allah\" means the Holy Qur'an.  \n \n43.10b Another supplication  \n \nOr you may say, \"I seek refuge with the noble face of Allah \nand with the complete words of Allah which neither a \npious or impious person can overlook, and with all the \nMost Beautiful Names of Allah, what I know of them and \nwhat I do not know, from the evil of what He created, \noriginated, and produced, and from the evil of what \ndescends from the sky and from the evil of what ascends in \nit, and from the evil of the trials of the night and day, and \nfrom the evil of from the evil of every visitant at night \nexcept that which knocks with good, O All-Merciful.\"  \n \nOne may add, \"And from every beast whose forelock my \nLord has taken, My Lord is on a Straight Path.\"  \n \nThere are more than ninety-nine Names. Shaikh al-Qushayri \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Allah azza wa jall has a thousand \nnames: three hundred in the Torah three hundred in the Zabur \nand three hundred in the Gospel and ninety-nine in the Holy \nQur'an and one in the Pages of Ibrahim (alaihi salam).  \n \n43.11 Supplication on entering a house  \n \nWhen someone enters his house, it is recommended that he \nsay, \"As Allah wills. There is no strength except by Allah.\"  \n \nHe also says this when he enters his garden or his shop after \ngiving the greeting if someone is there. If there is no one there, he \nsays, \"Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah.\" \nThat is because Allah azza wa jall says, \"Why, when you entered \nyour garden, did you not say, As Allah wills, there is no strength \nbut in Allah'?\" (Holy Qur‟an 18:38)  \n \n43.12 Disliked activities in mosques  \n \n43.12a. Not doing work  \n \nIn mosques it is disliked to do work like sewing and the \nlike.  \n \nThis is a prohibition or dislike.  \n \n43.12b. Other disliked activities  \n \nOne should not wash his hands in a mosque nor eat in it \nunless it is something light, like sawiq and the like. He \nshould not trim his mustache or nails there. If he does do \nso, he collects the clippings in his garment. He should not \nkill lice or fleas there.  \n \nHe should not eat things which might soil the mosque. Sawiq is \nroasted wheat or barley mixed with ghee or honey. Nail clippings \nand the like are considered dirt. Even if he puts it in his garment, \nit might fall out. The prohibition against killing lice is stronger \nthan that about fleas because lice can release blood which is not \nthe case with fleas.  \n \n43.12c An allowance to sleep in the mosque  \n \nThere is an allowance for strangers to spend the night in \nmosques in the countryside.  \n \nThis is out of necessity. It is understood that that is not an \nallowance in the mosques in towns since there are hotels there for \nwhich he can pay. If it is a case of necessity, then he can spend the \nnight there.  \n \n43.13 Reciting the Holy Qur'an  \n \n43.13a In bath houses  \n \nIn bathhouses one should not recite more than a few verses \nand not a lot.  \n \nThat is because it is a place of uncleanness.  \n \n43.13b When one can recite  \n \nOne can recite the Holy Qur'an riding, lying down, or \nwalking from one town to another, but that is disliked to \nrecite it while walking to the market, although it is said \nthat a learner can do that.  \n \nOne can recite in all these positions because Allah commanded \nremembrance in all states. He says, \"Remember Allah standing, \nsitting and on your sides.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:101) \"Walking to the \nmarket\" means the market in towns, not in the one in the \ncountryside which is not disliked.  \n \n43.13c The length of time one takes to recite the entire \nHoly Qur'an  \n \nIt is good for someone to recite the entire Holy Qur'an in \nseven nights, but to recite less with understanding is \nbetter. It is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did not recite it in less than three nights.  \n \nIt is good because that was the practice of most of the Salaf. It is \nbetter to reflect on the meanings because Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Will they not ponder the Qur'an?\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:82)  \n \n43.14 A supplication for beginning a journey  \n \nIt is recommended for a traveler to say when he mounts, \n\"In the Name of Allah. O Allah, You are the Companion in \nthe journey and the substitute in the family. O Allah, I seek \nrefuge with you from the hardship of the journey and from \nthe trouble of reversal and finding family and possessions \nin a poor state.\"  \n \nHash: This is related in sound hadith. He says this when he puts \nhis foot in the stirrup.  \n \n43.15 A supplication after mounting an animal  \n \nWhen the traveler is upright on his mount, he should say, \n\"Glory be to Him who subjected this to us. We could never \nhave done it by ourselves. Indeed we are returning to our \nLord!\" (Holy Qur’an 43:12-13)  \n \n43.16 Trading abroad  \n \nIt is disliked to trade in the land of the enemy or the land \nof the blacks.  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Travel is a \nportion of punishment.\"  \n \nThat is because he exposes his permission and property to attack \nand abasement to their deen. The land of the blacks refers to the \nland of those who are unbelievers. The full hadith in the Muwatta' \nis: \"Traveling is a portion of punishment. It denies you your sleep, \nfood and drink. When you have accomplished your purpose, you \nshould hurry back to your family.\"  \n \n43.17 Women traveling  \n \nA woman should not make a journey of a day and a night \nor more except with a relative except in the case of the \nobligatory hajj according to the position of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Then she may travel in a safe group, \neven if she has no relative with them.  \n \nShe can travel without a mahram provided that it is a safe group \nof Muslims.   \n  \n \n \nChapter 44: Medical treatment, charms, \nomens, stars, castration, branding, dogs, and \ncompassion to slaves \n \n \n \n44.1 Charms and medical treatment  \n \n44.1a. Making charms  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in using charms (ruqa) against the \nevil eye and other things, nor in using prayers for refuge.  \n \nCharms [written or spoken] can be used against bites of scorpions \nand snakes. The evil eye is a poison which Allah azza wa jall puts \nin the eye of the looker when he admires something and does not \nask for blessing. If he asks for blessing when he sees him, nothing \nbefalls the person he looks at since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said to the one with the evil eye, \"Did you not ask for \nblessing?\" There is no disagreement that it is permitted to make \ncharms using the Names of Allah azza wa jall and His Book.  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with using the refuge prayer. Muslim \nreports that when the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) had a \ncomplaint, he recited the refuge verses over himself: al-Ikhlas, al-\nFalaq and an-Nas and spit without actually spitting on his hand \nand wiped the part of his body which was afflicted.  \n \n44.1b Medical treatment  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in using medical treatment, \ndrinking medicine, being bled and cauterization. Cupping \nis good.  \n \nUsing \nmedicines \nfor \nillness \nis \nacceptable. \nCupping \nis \nrecommended at all times.  \n \n44.1c Kohl  \n \nIt is permitted for men to use kohl for treatment and it is a \ncosmetic for women.  \n \nKohl is antimony. Men only use it for necessity.  \n \nHashiyya: This is one of two positions from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). The other position is that it is permitted at \nnight.  \n \n44.1d What one is not permitted to use in treatment  \n \nWine, impurities, that which comes from carrion or \nanything which Allah azza wa jall has forbidden are not \nused for medical treatment.  \n \nIt is not permitted to use wine inside or on the outside the body. \nNothing of carrion is used since it is unclean. It is not permitted to \ntreat the itch by wearing silk, although there is some \ndisagreement about that.  \n \n44.1e Cauterization and charms (ruqa)  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in cauterization and using charms \nwith the Book of Allah azza wa jall or using good words.  \n \nGood words means words in Arabic. It is related in Sahih Bukhari \nand Muslim that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) uttered \na refuge prayer for one of his family. He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nstroked the person with his right hand and said, \"O Allah, Lord of \npeople, remove the harm. Heal. You are the Healer. There is no \nhealing but Your healing, a healing which does leave any illness \nbehind.\"  \n \nOne does not use charms consisting of unclear words since Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) was asked about foreign words and \nsaid, \"What will inform you? Perhaps they are disbelief.\" The \nruling in that is that it is not permitted to use for a charm that \nwhose meaning is not known.  \n \n44.1f Amulets  \n \nThere is no harm in amulets which contain something of \nthe Holy Qur'an.  \n \nThese are used for protection, whether for someone ill or healthy \nafter it is put inside something.  \n \n44.1g Plague  \n \nIf the plague breaks out in a land no one should enter it \nand those there should not flee from it.  \n \nOne does not flee from the plague because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) forbade that. It is disliked.  \n \n44.2 Portents  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said about evil omens, \n\"If they exist, they are in houses, women, and horses.\" The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) disliked bad names and \nliked good omens.  \n \nBad omens in a house is in the form of bad neighbors. In a woman \nit is like her lack of lineage or bad character, and in a horse, it is \nthe fact that it has not been ridden in expeditions. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) disliked names like Hanzala \n[colocynth] and Harb [war].  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) liked good omens, In the Sahih it is \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was asked, \n\"Rasulullah, what is the good omen?\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"A good word which one of you hears when he leaves on a \njourney or to visit a sick person and did not intend to hear.\" He \nhears something like, \"O Ghanim (successful)! O Salim (safe).\" If \nhe intends to hear the omen so as to act on it, that is not \npermitted. That is akin to arrow drawing. They had three arrows. \nOne said \"Do it\", the second \"Do not do it\" and the third was \nblank. When the person drew the one that said, \"Do it\", he would \ndo what he was going to do. If \"Do not do it\" came out, he went \nback. If he drew the blank, he repeated the process.  \n \n44.3 Curing the effect of the evil eye  \n \nThe manner of washing on account of the evil eye is that \nthe person responsible for the evil eye washes his face, \nhands, elbows, knees, ends of his feet and under his waist-\nwrapper over a basin. Then that water is poured over the \none afflicted.  \n \nHe must do this, And he is forced to do it if he refuses when death \nis feared for the one afflicted and that is the only means of saving \nhim. By under the waist-wrapper he means the area near the \nprivate parts.  \n \n44.4 Stars  \n \nOne should only look at the stars to find the direction of \nqibla and the time of the night and not other things.  \n \nA third purpose is permitted, and it is to use them for direction \nwhen traveling since Allah azza wa jall says, \"It is He who has \nappointed the stars for you so you might be guided by them in the \ndarkness of the land and sea.\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:98) Other things \nmeans things like astrology.  \n \n44.5 Dogs  \n \nDogs should not be kept in houses in the towns nor in \nhouses in the countryside except for those used for \nguarding crops or livestock where the dog accompanies \nthe flock into the desert and then comes home with them, \nor dogs used for hunting for livelihood, but not for sport.  \n \nThey are said to be permitted for guarding houses. If the dog is \nvicious, then it is forbidden to keep it unless it is a guard dog or a \nsheep dog. The general prohibition is one of dislike.  \n \n44.6 Gelding animals  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in castrating sheep and goats if it \nimproves their meat. It is forbidden to geld horses.  \n \nIt is forbidden to geld horses because that weakens them and \nremoves the possibility of using them for stud. It is permitted to \ngeld mules and donkeys. There is consensus that it is unlawful to \ncastrate a human being.  \n \n44.7 Branding animals  \n \nIt is disliked to brand on the face. There is nothing wrong \nin branding them elsewhere.  \n \nIt can be done elsewhere on the animal other than the face \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nbranding on the face and allowed marking the ear because the \nowner needs to distinguish his animals.  \n \n44.8 Kindness to slaves  \n \nOne should be kind to slaves and not oblige them to do \nwork they are incapable of doing.  \n \nOne should be kind to them in eating, drinking and work. The \nmaster is not permitted to oblige his slave to do what is hard for \nhim or what he or she cannot physically do.  \n \n \n \nChapter 45: Dreams, Yawning, Sneezing, \nPlaying Backgammon and other games, \nRacing Horses, shooting and the like \n \n \n45.1 Dreams  \n \n45.1a The good dream  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"A good dream of \na righteous man is a forty-sixth portion of prophethood.  \n \nIt is the same for a righteous woman. This means someone who \nobeys Allah azza wa jall's commands and avoids His prohibitions. \nIt is considered to be part of prophethood because it gives \ninformation about what is unseen in a certain way. As for the \ndetails connected to that, that is particular to the one who is a \nProphet.  \n \n45.1b The bad dream  \n \nIf someone has a dream he dislikes, when he wakes up, he \nshould spit three times to his left and say, \"O Allah, I seek \nrefuge in You from the evil of what I have seen in my \ndream lest it harm me in my deen or worldly affairs.\"  \n \nOne version has, \"He should seek refuge with Allah from the \nAccursed Shaitan three times and then turn onto his other side.\" \nThe wisdom of changing sides is to move to what is more favorable \nas it is hoped that Allah azza wa jall will change the disliked to \nthe good.  \n \n45.2 Yawning  \n \nIf someone yawns, he should put his hand over his mouth.  \n \nThe right hand, either side, or the back of the left hand. When the \nyawn is over, he spits without spit, even if he is in the prayer.  \n \n45.3 Sneezing  \n \nIf someone sneezes, he should say, \"Praise be to Allah,\" \n[Alhamdulillah] and the one who hears him praise Allah \nazza wa jall should say, \"May Allah have mercy on you\" \n[Yarhamuk’Allah]. The sneezer then replies, \"May Allah \nforgive us and you\" [Yaghfiru'Allahu lana wa lakum] or \n\"May \nAllah \nguide \nyou \nand \nmake \nyou \nthrive\" \n[Yahdikumu'Allah wa yuslih].  \n \n[When he sneezes, he can also say, \"Praise be to Allah, the Lord of \nthe Worlds.\" ]  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted from al-Bayan \nthat the best known position is that the reply is an individual \nobligation which is indicated by the hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari, \n\"It is a duty for every Muslim when he hears it to say, \"May Allah \nhave mercy on you.\" In the reply of the sneezer, the second reply is \nbetter because guidance is better than forgiveness and forgiveness \nis only on account of a wrong action.  \n \n45.4 Games and Betting  \n \n45.4a. Backgammon and chess  \n \nPlaying backgammon and chess is not permitted. There is \nnothing wrong in greeting someone who is playing them. It \nis disliked to sit with someone playing them and to watch \nthem.  \n \nWhether for winnings or not since it is confirmed that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The one who plays \nbackgammon has disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.\" Ibn 'Amr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Backgammon are pieces of ivory or \ncolored wood which are played with in which there is no skill, but \nbased on chance. It resembles playing with dice.\"  \n \nIt is not disliked to greet him while he is not playing. As for while \nhe is playing, it is not permitted because they are involved in \ndisobedience. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that his \nstatus as a witness is only revoked if that is habitual. The \nhabitual may violate oaths. If it is rare, then he should abandon it \nand his status is not canceled.  \n \n45.4b Contests  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in racing horses and camels and in \nholding archery competitions.  \n \nFor a prize or without a prize. Competition outside these three is \nnot permitted unless it is not for a prize.  \n \n45.4c Rules of prizes  \n \nIf two contestants stake a prize, they should put another \ncontestant between them. If the third party wins, he takes \nthe stake. If one of the other two wins, the third party gets \nnothing of it. This is the opinion of Shaikh ibn al-Musayyab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n45.4d Another view on prizes  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is allowed for \na man to set a stake. If someone beats him, then that \nwinner takes the prize. If the one who set the stake wins, it \ngoes to the one who came after him. If there is only the one \nwho put the stake and one another and the one who put \nthe stake wins, then the stake goes to the spectators.  \n \n45.5 Killing snakes and other creatures  \n \n45.5a. Snakes  \n \nIt is reported that when the snakes of Madina appear they \nare asked to leave for three days. Doing that in other \nplaces is good, but this is not done in the desert and they \nare killed when they appear.  \n \nThis is reported from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). \nThe evidence for asking permission is in the Muwatta' that the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There are jinn in Madina \nwho have become Muslim. When you see one of them, call out to it \nfor three days. If it appears after that, then kill it, for it is a \nShaitan.\"  \n \nThe form of asking them to leave to say, \"If you believe in Allah \nazza wa jall and the Last Day and you are Muslim, do not appear \nto us today. If you appear to us, we will kill you.\" There is no \nannouncement made in the deserts or roads.  \n \n45.5b Lice and fleas  \n \nKilling lice and fleas by fire is disliked.  \n \nThis includes other such creatures like bedbugs and gnats. If, \nhowever, they are causing harm by their numbers, then it is \npermitted.  \n \n45.5c Ants  \nThere is nothing wrong, insha’Allah, in killing ants when \nthey cause harm and cannot be removed, but it is better \nnot to kill them.  \n \nIf it is possible to remove them, that is better.  \n \n45.5d Geckos  \n \nGeckos are killed.  \n \nHash: They are killed wherever they are found because the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) commanded killing them.  \n \n45.5e Frogs  \n \nIt is disliked to kill frogs.  \n \nAs long as they are not harmful.  \n \nHash: The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade killing \nthem.\" It is said that their croaking is glorification  \n \n45.6 Not boasting about ancestors  \n \n45.6a. The Boasting of the Jahiliyya  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah has \nremoved from you the stupidity of the Jahiliyya and their \nboasting of their ancestors. Whether you are godfearing \nbelievers or wretched deviant, you are the sons of Nabi \nAdam (alaihi salam), and Adam (alaihi salam) came from \ndust.\"  \n \nStupidity is arrogance and tyranny. If you obey the commands of \nAllah azza wa jall and avoid His prohibitions, you are elevated \nwith Allah azza wa jall by taqwa, even if you have no noble \nlineage. If you are a deviant unbeliever without taqwa, you are \nbase, even if you have noble lineage. Rivalry in ancestors does not \nbring about anything at all. How can you be arrogant and proud \nwhen you are all from dust?  \n \n45.6b Genealogy  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said about a man \nwho learned the genealogies of people, \"A useless \nknowledge and ignorance of it will not harm one.\"  \n \nIt is of no use either in this world or the next.  \n \n45.6c Useful genealogy  \n \n'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Learn about your lineage’s \nenough to be able to maintain ties of kinship.\"  \n \nSo that you know who your relatives are.  \n \n45.6d Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) dislike of tracing \nancestors  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I dislike of tracing \ngenealogies back to ancestors before Islam.\"  \n \n45.7 Dreams  \n \n45.7a. The general ruling  \n \nA good dream is a forty-sixth part of prophethood. If \nsomeone has a bad dream he should spit to his left and \nseek the protection of Allah azza wa jall from the evil \nwhich he has seen.  \n \nThis is repeated because of the context.  \n \n45.7b Dream interpretation  \n \nSomeone who has no knowledge of the science of dreams \nshould not interpret them, nor should he interpret it as \nindicative of something good when he knows that it \nindicates something disliked.  \n \nThis is forbidden. To give an interpretation without knowledge is \nlying and contrary to the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"Do not \npursue what you have no knowledge of.\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:36) \nChanging the interpretation is forbidden because it is lying and \ndeceit. If there is good, he mentions it. If it is something bad, he \nsays, \"Good, insha‟Allah.\"  \n \n45.8 Poetry  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in reciting poetry, but a small \namount is better. One should not spend too much time with \nreciting or composing it.  \n \nThis is when it does not criticize someone. One should not spend \ntoo much time on it because it is vanity and it is better to be \noccupied with something better.  \n \n45.9 Religious knowledge  \n \n45.9a The best knowledge  \n \nThe best and most fitting type of knowledge and the closest \nto Allah azza wa jall is knowledge of His deen and His laws \nregarding what He commanded, forbade, summoned to and \nencouraged in His Book and on the tongue of His Holy \nProphet \n(alaihi \nsalat \nwa \nsalam). \nOne \nmust \nhave \nunderstanding and a grasp of that and be concerned with \nobserving that and acting according to it.  \n \nThe knowledge which contains the religious dogma, like \nrecognition of the Maker and knowledge of His existence and all \nHis attributes, and knowledge of the laws which is the halal and \nharam, and other laws which are obligatory and recommended \nand what is forbidden and disliked. One should know what Allah \nazza wa jall and His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nencouraged. One should have understanding of the deen of Allah \nazza wa jall and know its laws. Acting by it is the best of actions \nand the one which will bring one closer to Allah azza wa jall \nbecause the fruit of knowledge is action.  \n \n45.9b The best action  \n \nKnowledge is the best of actions. The closest scholar to \nAllah azza wa jall and most entitled to Him is the one with \nthe greatest fear of Him and desire for what is with Him. \nKnowledge directs to good things and guides to them.  \n \nThis is knowledge of the deen and the laws since the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) has said, \"The best worship is fiqh and the \nbest of the deen is scrupulousness.\" The Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Whoever travels a path in which he seeks \nknowledge, Allah azza wa jall will make his path to the Garden \neasy.\"  \n \n45.9c Refuge  \n \nSalvation lies in seeking protection in the Book of Allah \nazza wa jall and the Sunnah of His Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) and following the path of the believers and \nthat of the best of generations of the best community \nproduced for mankind.  \n \nThe path of the believers means consensus. The best generation \nare the Companions, may Allah azza wa jall be pleased with all of \nthem.  \n \n45.9d Deliverance  \n \nReliance on that is protection. Salvation lies in following \nthe righteous Salaf. They are the model with regard to the \ninterpretations which they made and the results of their \ndeductions. Even though they differed in the secondary \nruling, no should leave their group.  \n \nPraise belongs to Allah azza wa jall who guided us to this \nand were it not that Allah azza wa jall has guided us, we \nwould not have been guided.  \n \nThe righteous Salaf are the first three generations of the scholars \nof action and the later ones described with their qualities. \nInterpretation is moving the expression from its literal meaning, \nas the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The neighbor of \nthe mosque has no prayer except in the mosque.\" That would \nappear that he has no sound prayer. What is indicted by the basic \nexpression negates the reality, which is that it is absolutely \ninvalid. One turns to what is near it, and it means it is not perfect. \nBecause the consensus of the Companions is evidence, it is \nmandatory to follow it and it is forbidden to oppose it.  \n \nEpilogue  \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad 'Abdullah ibn Zayd (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says: \"We have now done what we stipulated on \nourselves to do in this book of ours. Insha’Allah, it will be \nof use to those children who desire to learn that and adults \nwho are in need of it. What is contains will lead the \nignorant to knowledge of what to believe in his deen and \nwhat obligations he must perform. It will give him much \nunderstanding of the basic principles and secondary \nrulings of fiqh as well as the Sunnah’s, desirable practices \nand manners.  \n \nI ask Allah azza wa jall to let us and you benefit by what \nwe know and to help us and you perform what we owe Him \nin what He obliged on us. There is no power nor strength \nexcept by Allah, the All-Knowing, Immense. May Allah azza \nwa jall bless our master Muhammad, His Prophet, and his \nfamily and Companions and grant them much peace.  \nAmin!"

    "text": "Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani (rahmatullahi alaihi) \n(310/922 - 386/996) \nThe author of Ar-Risala \nTranslated by Aisha Bewley \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad 'Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) was one of the people North Africa. Shaikh Abu Zayd's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) name was 'Abdu'r-Rahman according to \nShaikh ibn Makula (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Qadi ibn al-\nHadhdha' (rahmatullahi alaihi). He was from the tribe of Nifza \nand lived in Qayrawan. \n \nHis (rahmatullahi alaihi) position in knowledge  \n \nHe was the Imam of the Malikis in his time and their model. He \nhad a comprehensive grasp of the school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and explained his statements. He had \nextensive knowledge and a prodigious memory and transmission. \nHis books are ample testimony of that. His writing was fluent, \nclarifying and defining what he said. He defended the school of \nImam Malik and established evidence in its support. He knew how \nto refute the people of sects. In addition to his writing, he was very \nrighteous, scrupulousness and chastity. He obtained leadership in \nthe deen and this world. and people from all regions traveled to \nvisit him. His companions were noble and many people took \nknowledge from him. He composed a summary of the school and \nundertook to spread it and defend it. His books filled the lands \nand were well-known to most of its people.  \n \nShaikh ash-Shirazi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He was known as \n'little Malik'. Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentioned him and said that he was a reliable Imam in his \nperception and transmission. Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn \n'Abdullah al-Qattan (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, 'I did not imitate \nShaikh Abu Muhammad ibn Abi Zayd until I saw Shaikh As-\nSaba'i imitated him.'\"  \n \nShaikh Abu Bakr ibn at-Tayyib (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned \nhim in his book, and esteemed his  value and merit. The same was \ntrue among other scholars in the east. Shaikh ibn Mujahid al-\nBaghdadi (rahmatullahi alaihi) and other Baghadadi companions \nof him asked him for an ijaza.  \n \nShaikh Abu 'Abdullah al-Mayruqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He \npossessed knowledge, scrupulousness, excellence and intellect. He \nis too famous to need to be mentioned.\"  \n \nShaikh ad-Da'udi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He was quick to \nfollow the truth. He studied fiqh with the fuqaha' of his land and \nlistened to its Shaikhs. He relied on Shaikh Abu Bakr ibn al-\nLubbad (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Abu'l-Fadl al-Mumsi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and also studied with Shaikh Muhammad \nibn Masrur al-'Assal (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abdullah ibn \nMasrur ibn al-Hajjam (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Qattan \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Ibyyani (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh Ziyad ibn Musa (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Sa'dun al-\nKhawlani (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abu'l-'Arab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh Abu Ahmad ibn Abi Sa‟id (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi), the client of Shaikh Ibn Abi \nSulayman (rahmatullahi alaihi), and others. He traveled and went \non hajj and listened to Shaikh ibn al-A'rabi (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Mundhir (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh Abu 'Ali ibn Abi Hilal (rahmatullahi alaihi), and \nShaikh Ahmad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthe Qadi. He also listened to Shaikh Al-Hasan ibn Badr \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nShaikh \nMuhammad \nibn \nAl-Fath \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Hasan ibn Nasr as-Susi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Darras ibn Isma'il (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh 'Uthman ibn Sa‟id al-Gharabuli (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh Habib ibn Abi Habib al-Jazari (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and others. Shaikh ibn Sha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh al-Aburri (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh al-Marwazi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) asked him for an ijaza. Many people listened \nto him and a lot of people learned fiqh with him. His adherents in \nQayrawan included Shaikh Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Abu'l-Qasim al-Baradha'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh al-Lubaydi (rahmatullahi alaihi), the sons of \nShaikh al-Ajdabi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abu 'Abdullah al-\nKhawwas (rahmatullahi alaihi), and Shaikh Abu Muhammad al-\nMakki al-Muqri' (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nThe people of Andalusia who followed him (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ninclude Shaikh Abu Bakr ibn Mawhab al-Maqburi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh Abu 'Abdullah ibn al-Hadhdha' (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh Abu Marwan al-Qanazi‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe people of Ceuta include Shaikh Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn al-\n'Ajuz (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh Abu Muhammad ibn Ghalib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and Shaikh Khalaf ibn Nasr (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). The people of the Maghrib include Shaikh Abu 'Ali ibn \nAmdakatu as-Sijilmasi (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nHis (rahmatullahi alaihi) books  \n \nHe has the Kitab an-Nawadir wa'z-Ziyadat 'ala'l-Mudawwana \nwhich is famous and has more than a hundred sections, and the \nfamous Mukhtasar (Summary) of the Mudawwana. Instruction in \nfiqh in the Maghrib is founded on these two books.  \n \nHe also wrote a revision of the 'Utibiyya, The Imitation of the \nPeople of Madina, The Defense of the School of Madina, the \nfamous Risala, the Kitab an-Tanbih on the position of the children \nof apostates, Waqfs for the Children of Notables, Explanation of \nthe Times of the Prayer, Trust and Reliance on Allah, The Book of \nGnosis and Certainty, Insurance of Provision, Kitab al-Manasik, a \ntreatise on those who are moved by the recitation of the Holy \nQur'an and dhikr, a book on Turning Away the Beggar, the \nProtection of the Reputation of the Believer, Kitab al-Bayan on the \ninimitability of the Holy Qur'an, Kitab al-Wasawis, a treatise on \ngiving relatives some of the zakat, a treatise prohibiting \nargumentation, a treatise refuting the Qadariyya and rebuttal to \nthe treatise of al-Baghdadi al-Mu'tazili, the Kitab al-Istizhar on \nthe refutation of the conceptualists [fikriya], Removal of \nUncertainty on the same topic, Book of Admonition and Counsel, \nTreatise on the Seeker of Knowledge, The Excellence of Praying at \nNight in Ramadan, Excellent Warning for the People of \nTruthfulness, a letter to the people of Sijilmasa on recitation of the \nHoly Qur'an, and a treatise on the fundamentals of tauhid. All of \nhis books are beneficial and extraordinary and full of knowledge.  \n \nIt is mentioned that one day he went to visit Abu Sa‟id \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), the nephew of Hisham (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nand \nfound \nhis \ngathering \nin \nsession. \nAbu \nSa‟id \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said to him, \"I have heard that you have \nwritten books.\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"may Allah azza wa jall make \nyou prosper!\" He said, \"Listen to a problem.\" Abu Muhammad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) told him, \"Mention it, may Allah azza wa jall \nmake you prosper. If I am correct, you will tell me. If I am wrong, \nyou will teach us.\" Abu Sa‟id (rahmatullahi alaihi) was silent and \ndid not do that again.  \n \nThe rest of his (rahmatullahi alaihi) reports  \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) was one of the \npeople of righteousness, scrupulousness and excellence. It is \nreported that he got up one night to do wudu' and poured water \nfrom the jug into the vessel and spilled it. Then he poured it again \nand spilled it. Then that happened a third time and he had some \ndoubts and remarked, \"You are recalcitrant towards us.\" He heard \nsomeone he could not see say, \"The child wet the bed over the jug \nand we disliked for you to do wudu' from it.\"  \n \nWhen he wrote his books about the conceptualists and criticized \nthe book of 'Abdu'r-Rahman as-Siqilli in al-Kashf and al-Istizhar \nand refuted a lot of what they had transmitted regarding miracles \n(kharq al-'adat) according to what was affirmed in his book, the \nfalse Sufis and a lot of the people of hadith objected to that and \nspread it about that he denied miracles (karamat), which he did \nnot do. Indeed, at the beginning of his book, he articulates his aim, \nwhich is to refute a certain group of people found in Andalusia and \nthe east. Many well-known books have been written on that, \nincluding the books of Abu'l-Hasan ibn Jahdam al-Hamdani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Abu Bakr al-Baqillani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Abu 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn Shaqq al-Layl (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Abu 'Umar at-Talamanki (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. \nThe most correctly guided of them in that and had the best \nknowledge of his aim and its worth was the Imam of his time, \nQadi Abu Bakr ibn at-Tayyib al-Baqillani (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nHe made his aim clear.  \n \nAl-Ajdabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I was sitting with Abu \nMuhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) when Abu'l-Qasim 'Abdu'r-\nRahman ibn 'Abdu'l-Mu'min (rahmatullahi alaihi) the mutakallim \nwas with him (rahmatullahi alaihi). A man asked them about al-\nKhidr \n and whether it could be said that he \n was still in \nthis world in spite of all this time and would not die until the \nFinal Hour comes and whether this is refuted by the words of the \nAlmighty, 'We did not give any human being before you \nimmortality.' (Holy Qur‟an 21:34) They both replied to him that \nthat was possible and permitted and al-Khidr \n could live until \nthe Final Trumpet was blown. Immortality is connected to \nremaining as long as the Next World remains, and remaining \nuntil the Trumpet is blown is not immortality. Do you not see that \nIblis - may Allah azza wa jall curse him - is not immortal, but he is \none of those deferred until the Day of a Known Time.  \n \nIt is mentioned that Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) wrote \nto Abu Bakr al-Aburri (rahmatullahi alaihi):  \n \nHearts refuse the hearts of a people when they have no \nportion with them. But selves choose selves while they have \nno portion with them. That is only because of secrets known \nby the All-Watchful Witness.  \n \nAbu'l-Qasim al-Lubaydi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"'Isa ibn \nThabit al-„Abid (rahmatullahi alaihi) met Shaikh Abu Muhammad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and they wept a lot together and \nadmonished one another. When he wanted to leave, 'Isa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said to him, 'I want you to write my name on \nthe carpet under you. When you see it, you can make supplication \nfor me. Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) wept and said to \nhim, 'Allah Almighty says, \"All good words rise to Him and He \nraises up all righteous deeds.\" (35:10) Let me make supplication \nfor you, but where are the righteous deeds to elevate it?'\"  \n \nHis (rahmatullahi alaihi) death  \n \nAbu Muhammad ibn Abi Zayd (rahmatullahi alaihi) died in 386 \nand was eulogized by a lot of the writers of Qayrawan who \ncomposed a number of moving elegies about him.  \n \nIt is mentioned that Abu Muhammad (rahmatullahi alaihi) was \nseen in his assembly reflecting in sorrow and he was asked what \nthe reason for that. He replied, \"I dreamt that the door of my \nhouse had fallen down. Al-Kirmani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that \nit indicates the death of the owner of the house.\" He was asked, \"Is \nal-Kirmani (rahmatullahi alaihi) considered to be like Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in his science?\" \"Yes,\" he replied, \"In \nhis science, he is like Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is in his \nknowledge.\" It was not long after that that he died, may Allah \nazza wa jall have mercy on him.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Risala \nof \nShaikh Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) \n(310/922 - 386/996) \nA Treatise on Maliki Fiqh \n \n \n(Including commentary from ath-Thamr ad-Dani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) by al-Azhari (rahmatullahi alaihi))  \nAbu Muhammad Abdullah (rahmatullahi alaihi), a Maliki faqih \nknown as \"Shaikh al-Faqih\" and \"little Malik\". He was the head of \nthe Maliki School in Qayrawan. He wrote ar-Risala and an-\nNawadir and several other books.  \n(The translation here is not intended to be the final version,  \nbut it is hoped that it will be of some use to those looking  \nfor texts on Maliki fiqh.)  \nComments are welcome in the guest book.  \n \nIn the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate.  \n \nMay Allah azza wa jall bless our Master Muhammad and his \nfamily and Companions and give him peace.  \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad 'Abdullah ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani, \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), says:  \n \nSHAIKH \nIBN \nABI'S \nZAYD'S \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nPROLOGUE  \n \nPraise be to Allah azza wa jall who begins the creation of man as a \nblessing from Him and fashions him in the womb by His wisdom \nand brings him out into His tender care and to the provision He \neases him to and teaches him what he did not know - \"Allah's \nbounty upon him is ever great.\"  \n \nAllah azza wa jall makes him aware of Himself through the signs \nin what He has made and has left no excuse for him by virtue of \nwhat His Messengers, the best of His creation, have brought. He \nguides in His generosity, those whom He has granted success and \nHe leads astray, in His justice, those for whom He has decreed \ndebasement. He eases the believers to ease in both the worlds and \nopens their hearts to the Reminder. So they believe in Allah azza \nwa jall, pronouncing this belief with their tongues, being sincere \nabout it in their hearts and acting according to what has come \ndown to them through His Messengers and His Books. They learn \nwhat He teaches them and keep within the limits that which He \nhas prescribed for them. They are happy with what He has made \nhalal for them and avoid what He has made haram for them.  \n \nMay Allah azza wa jall assist both us and you in taking care of \nwhat He has entrusted us with and in holding to His Shari‟ah. \nYou have asked me to write a short treatise for you about what is \nobligatory in the din - those things which should be pronounced by \nthe tongue and believed by the heart and done by the limbs; and \nabout those Sunnah‟s which are associated with these obligatory \nactions - the confirmed (mu'akkada), the optional (nafila) and the \ndesirable (raghiba); something about the courtesies (adab) \nassociated with them; along with certain of the key principles and \nderived judgments in jurisprudence (fiqh) according to the \nmadhhab and way of Imam Malik ibn Anas (rahmatullahi alaihi); \nand in addition to mention what the great men of knowledge and \nfiqh have said about unclear matters in the madhhab in order to \nmake them easier to understand.  \n \nYou have made this request because of your desire to teach these \nthings to children in the same way that you teach them how to \nread the Holy Qur'an so that they may first of all gain an \nunderstanding of the din of Allah azza wa jall and His Shari‟ah in \ntheir hearts, which will hopefully bring them blessing and a good \nend result.  \n \nI have responded to this out of the same hope of gaining for both \nmyself and you something of the reward of those who teach the \ndin of Allah azza wa jall or call to it.  \n \nKnow that the best of hearts is the one which contains the most \ngood and those hearts which are most likely to gain good are the \nones which no evil has been able to get into. The thing that the \npeople of advice are most concerned about and which those who \ndesire its reward most want is to put good into the hearts of the \nchildren of the believers so that it becomes firmly established in \nthem; and to make them realize what the bases of the din and the \nlimits of the Shari‟ah are in order that they may be satisfied with \nthat and to make them realize those things in the din which their \nhearts have to accept and their limbs are required to do.  \n \nIt is related that teaching the Book of Allah azza wa jall to young \nchildren extinguishes the anger of Allah azza wa jall and also that \nteaching something to someone in their childhood is like \nengraving it on stone.  \n \nI have made these things clear and if Allah azza wa jall wills they \nwill get benefit from learning them, nobility from knowing them \nand happiness from believing them and acting according to them.  \n \nIt has come down to us that children should be ordered to do the \nprayer at seven years old and beaten for not doing it at ten years \nold and be separated in their beds. Similarly, they should be \ntaught before they reach puberty those words and actions which \nAllah azza wa jall has made obligatory for people so that when \nthey reach puberty these things are fixed in their hearts and they \nare at ease with them and their limbs are used to doing them. For \nAllah azza wa jall has made certain beliefs obligatory for the heart \nand certain acts of obedience obligatory for the limbs.  \n \nI will arrange what I have undertaken to talk about in chapters so \nthat it will be easier, if Allah azza wa jall wills, for those who are \nstudying it to understand. It is Him we ask for guidance and Him \nwe ask for help. And there is no power nor strength except by \nAllah, the High, the Mighty. May Allah bless our Master \nMuhammad, His Prophet, and his family and Companions and \ngrant them much peace."

    "text": "ONE: CREEDS \n \nThe obligatory matters of the din that the tongue should give \nexpression to and in which the heart should believe.  \n \nThis chapter clarifies what should be expressed in words and what \nhearts should believe. It contains about a hundred items of creed, \nwhich can be divided into three basic categories: that which must \nbe believed about Allah azza wa jall, that which is impossible in \nrespect of Allah azza wa jall, and that which is permissible in \nrespect of Him.  \n \nThese are matters which all those who are legally responsible \nmust believe.  \n \n1.1 Beliefs regarding Allah azza wa jall \n \n1.1a \nTauhid \n-His \nOneness \nand \nDisconnection \nfrom \ncreatures (tanzih)  \n \nThese obligatory tenets include believing in the heart and \nexpressing with the tongue that Allah azza wa jall is One \nGod with no god other than Him, nor any likeness to Him, \nnor any equal to Him.  \n \nBelief is expressed on the tongue and confirmed by sincerity in the \nheart and action with the limbs. Thus it is composed of all three \naspects. Nonetheless, simple belief in the Oneness of Allah azza \nwa jall will save a person from being in the Fire for all eternity.  \n \nThe belief that Allah azza wa jall is One is the fundamental basis \nof Islam, and when Divine Unity is expressed, the name \"Allah\" \nmust be used. It is not permissible to say, \"There is no god but the \nAlmighty\" or use any other names except Allah. Nothing at all \nresembles Him or is equal to Him.  \n \nAl-Kalbi (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentions that the clear evidence for \nthis is found in four ayats: \"If there had been any gods except \nAllah in heaven or earth, they would both be ruined\" (Holy Qur‟an \n21:22); \"Say: 'If there had been other gods together with Him as \nyou say, they would have sought a way to the Master of the \nThrone'\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:42); \"Allah has no son and there is no \nother god accompanying Him, for then each god would have gone \noff with what he created and one of them would have been exalted \nabove the other\" (Holy Qur‟an 23:91); and \"But they have adopted \ngods apart from Him which do not create anything. They are \nthemselves created.\" (Holy Qur‟an 25:3)  \n \n1.1b Lack of Associates  \n \nHe has had no child. He had no father. He has no wife. He \nhas no partner.  \n \nSee the Holy Qur'an 112: \"Say: He is Allah, One with no other, \nAllah the Everlasting Sustainer of all. He has not given birth and \nwas not born and there is no one is equal to Him,\" and \"And say: \n'Praise be to Allah Who has had no son and Who has no partner in \nHis Kingdom and Who needs no one to protect Him from \nabasement.'\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:111)  \n \nHe is totally unique. If he were to have a wife or partner, that \nwould imply need, and He is absolutely beyond need.  \n \n1.1c Lack of Temporality  \n \nThere is no beginning to His firstness nor any end to His \nlastness.  \n \nHis existence does not begin with firstness so that there is a point \nat which He could be said to begin nor does He have a point at \nwhich He could be said to end. He exists eternally, out of time, \nbefore time and after time.  \n \n1.1d Ineffability and Indefinability  \n \nThose who try to describe Him can never adequately do so \nnor can thinkers encompass Him in their thought. Real \nthinkers may derive lessons from His signs but do not try \nto think about the nature of His Essence. \"But they do not \nattain any of His knowledge except what He wills.\" (Holy \nQur’an 2:254)  \n \n It is impossible to grasp His true description, let alone His \nEssence. Thinkers must learn through the Signs which indicate \nthe splendor of His Power, but must not attempt to reflect on the \nnature of His Essence because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Reflect on His creation, but do not reflect on His \nEssence.\"  \n \n1.1e His Footstool  \n \n\"His Footstool embraces the heavens and the earth, and \ntheir preservation does not tire Him. He is the Most High, \nthe Magnificent\" (Holy Qur’an 2:254)  \n \nHe has full control and authority over all creation, high and low, \nand His preservation of them is no burden for Him.  \n \n1.1f His Attributes  \n \nThe All-Knower and the All-Aware, the Arranger and the \nAll-Powerful. The All-Hearer and the All-Seeing. The High \nand the Great. He is over His Glorious Throne by His \nEssence.  \n \nHe has knowledge of all things, and complete power and authority \nover all things. His hearing and vision is connected to all things in \nexistence.  \n \n1.1g His knowledge  \n \nHe is everywhere by His knowledge. He created man and \nHe knows what his self whispers to him and He is nearer to \nhim than his jugular vein. No leaf falls without him \nknowing of it nor is there any seed in the darkness of the \nearth, nor any fresh thing nor any dry thing, that is not in \na clear book.  \n \nHe knows our inner dialogue and thoughts. He is closer to man \nthat his jugular vein, which is his physical body, and so He is \ncloser to man than his own physicality. \"We created man and We \nknow what his own self whispers to him, and We are nearer to \nhim than his jugular vein.\" (Holy Qur‟an 50:16) In addition to the \nuniversal scope of His knowledge, He knows the precise details, \nlike each individual leaf which falls – and it only falls by His will \nand \nin \naccordance \nwith \nHis \nknowledge. \nEverything \nis \nencompassed by His knowledge, dead or alive, growing or \ndormant. \"The keys of the Unseen are in His possession. No one \nknows them except for Him. He knows everything in the land and \nsea. Not a leaf falls without His knowing it. There is no seed in the \ndarkness of the earth, and no wet thing or dry thing, but that it is \nin a Clear Book.\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:59)  \n \n1.1h Mastery over all creation  \n \nHe is firmly established on His throne and has absolute \ncontrol over His kingdom.  \n \nNo one knows the true interpretation of this expression. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) was asked about it and said, \"'Firmly \nestablished' is known but 'how' is not known.\" Nothing is hidden \nfrom Him and His control is absolute. \"He then established \nHimself firmly on the Throne.\" (Holy Qur‟an 10:3, etc.)  \n \n1.1i His Names and Attributes  \n \nHe has the most beautiful names and the most sublime attributes \nand He has always had all these names and attributes. He is \nexalted above any of His attributes ever having been created or \nany of His names having been brought into temporal (worldly) \nexistence.  \n \nHe is described by the best and noblest of the meanings of His \nNames. He has attributes like power, will, height, and so forth. He \nis high, exalted over any imperfection or short-coming. These \nNames have always been His and will remain His. Thus neither \nHis names nor His attributes are created. They are simply His. \n\"To Allah belong the Most Beautiful Names\" (Holy Qur‟an 7:180)  \n \n1.1j His Speech and Manifestation  \n \nHe spoke to Nabi Musa (alaihi salam) with His speech which \nis an attribute of His essence and not something created. \nHe \nmanifested \nHimself \nto \nthe \nmountain \nand \nit \ndisintegrated through exposure to His majesty.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall spoke to Nabi Musa (alaihi salam) with His \ntimeless words and Nabi Musa (alaihi salam) actually heard His \ntimeless speech. “When Musa came to Our appointed time and his \nLord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show me Yourself so that I \nmay look at You!' He said, 'You will not see Me, but look at the \nmountain. If it remains firm in its place, then you will see Me.' \nBut when His Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, He \ncrushed it flat and Musa fell unconscious to the ground.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 7:143)  \n \n1.2  Belief in the Holy Qur'an  \n \nThe Holy Qur'an is the speech of Allah azza wa jall, not \nsomething created which must therefore die out, nor the \nattribute of something created which must therefore come \nto an end.  \n \nThe Holy Qur'an is the speech of Allah azza wa jall which is not \ncreated and is timeless, outside of temporal (earthly, mortal) time. \nHence it will not end as creatures must end, but will abide \nendlessly.  \n \n1.3  Belief in the Decree (Qadar)  \n \n1.3a The Prior Decree of Good and Evil  \n \nAlso included is belief in the Decree both the good of it and \nthe evil of it, the sweet of it and the bitter of it. All of this \nhas been decreed by Allah azza wa jall, our Lord. The way \nthings are decided is entirely in His hand and the way they \nhappen is according to His decree. He knows all things \nbefore they come into existence and they take place in the \nway He has already decided.  \n \nIt is necessary to believe that all things, good and evil, are decreed \nby Allah azza wa jall and nothing escapes His will and thus only \nwhat He wills occurs in His kingdom. All things and their being \nbrought into existence from the concealment of non-existence to \nthe domain of manifestation in their myriad aspects and forms – \nlong and short, at one time rather than one, in one place rather \nthan another. All of that occurs and issues directly from His \nDecree according to His knowledge and dependent on His will.  \n \n1.3b Prior Knowledge  \n \nThere is nothing that His servants say or do which He has \nnot decreed and does not have knowledge of. \"Does not He \nwho creates know, when He is the Subtle and the Aware.\" \n(Holy Qur’an 67:14)  \n \nHe knows everything which happens before it happens. It only \noccurs in accordance with His knowledge of it.  \n \n1.3c The Prior Predisposition of People  \n \nHe leads astray whoever He wills and in His justice \ndebases them and He guides whoever He wills and in His \ngenerosity grants them success. In that way everyone is \neased by Him to what He already has knowledge of and has \npreviously decreed as to whether they are to be among the \nfortunate or the miserable.  \n \nEvery man has prior disposition to what Allah azza wa jall \nalready knows about him being happy or wretched because Allah \nazza wa jall only created man according to His knowledge. See \nHoly Qur'an 14:4, 3:160, etc.  \n \n1.3d Exaltedness of Allah azza wa jall's power  \n \nHe is exalted above there being anything He does not \ndesire in His kingdom, or that there should be anything \nnot dependent on Him, or that there should be any creator \nof anything other than Him, the Lord of all people, the \nLord of their actions, the One who decrees their \nmovements and the time of their death.  \n \n The power of Allah azza wa jall is so immense and vast that there \nis nothing which is not directly under his authority and subject to \nHis will. All things - might and abasement, wealth and poverty, \npious actions and all things are subject to His will and power.  \n \n1.4  Belief in the Messengers (may Allah azza wa jall bless \nthem all) and the Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \n1.4a The sending of Messengers (may Allah azza wa jall \nbless them all) \n \nHe has sent Messengers to them in order that they should \nhave no argument against Him.  \n \nThe first of the Prophets was Nabi Adam (alaihi salam) and the \nlast was Nabi Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam). One must \nbelieve and accept that Allah azza wa jall sent the Messengers \n(may He bless them all) to those who are legally responsible, i.e. \nadult and sane, and they conveyed the Message. The wisdom of \nsending the Messengers (may He bless them all) is that it removes \nany excuse which creatures might offer about not having heard \nthe Message.  \n \n1. 4b The Final Messenger (alaihi salat wa salam) \n \nHe sealed this Messengership, warning, and Prophethood \nwith his Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam), \nwhom He made the last of the Messengers - \"A bringer of \ngood news and a warner, calling to Allah azza wa jall by \nHis permission and an illuminating lamp.\"  \n \nRevelation, which is warning and prophethood, which is informing \nabout what Allah azza wa jall has said, reaches its end with the \nHoly Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam). There will be \nno Prophets after him. He brings the good news that whoever \nfollows him will be happy and whoever does not will be punished. \nHe calls to Allah azza wa jall, conveying tauhid to the legally \nresponsible, and fighting the unbelievers. He is an illuminating \nlight because his Shari‟ah is a light which guides the bewildered – \nwhoever follows it and proceeds along the Straight Path will \nemerge from the darkness of disbelief to the light of belief.  \n \n1.4c Divine Guidance through the Book  \n \nHe sent down on him His Wise Book and by means of him \nHe explained His upright din and guided people to the \nStraight Path.  \n \nOne must believe and affirm that Allah azza wa jall revealed to \nHis Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) a Book \ncontaining judgment and wisdom to which no falsehood at all \ncomes. Allah azza wa jall opened and expanded the Straight din of \nIslam through His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Thus He \nmanifests its judgments and clarifies it on the tongue of His Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam). Allah azza wa jall only sent down \nthe revelation to us so that it would be clear to people. The \nguidance of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) \nis the sun of knowledge‟s, the source of right guidance and the \nfount of certainty which guides people to the Straight Path.  \n \n1.5  Belief in the Resurrection and Judgment  \n \n1.5a The Last Hour  \n \nAlso part of what must be believed is that the Hour is \ncoming - there is no doubt about it.  \n \n(Holy Qur‟an 40:59) This must be confirmed and believed and the \none who denies that the Final Hour will come is an unbeliever. \nHowever, but only the All-Knower of the Unseen knows when it \nwill come.  \n \n1.5b Resurrection of the Dead  \n \nIt must be believed that Allah azza wa jall will raise up all \nwho have died: \"As He brought them into existence the first \ntime so they will be brought back again;\"  \n \nIt must be believed that He will bring the dead back to life after \nthey are dead and bring them back for the Gathering. There is no \ndisagreement among Muslims that it will occur, but there is \ndisagreement about whether He will bring them back from \nabsolutely nothing or from dissolution through a reconstitution of \ntheir parts.  \n \n1.5c Divine Reward: Multiplication of Good Actions  \n \nIt must be believed that Allah azza wa jall multiplies the \nreward of the good actions of His believing servants.  \n \nIt must be believed that Allah azza wa jall will multiply good \nactions for the believers according to sincerity and degrees of \nhumility, so that multiplication can be from ten to 700, in other \nwords, a great deal. Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) transmitted that Allah azza wa jall multiplies the good \naction a thousand times. This means the reward for doing them. \nThe \"good action\" is what is praised in the Shari‟ah, and what is \nthe opposite of that is a \"bad action\", which is what the Shari‟ah \nconsiders reprehensible.  \n \n1.5d Pardoning Wrong Actions  \n \nHe pardons them for their major wrong actions by virtue \nof their repentance (tauba) and forgives them for their \nminor wrong actions by virtue of their avoidance of the \nmajor wrong actions.  \n \nPart of His bounty to His believing servants is that if anyone does \nany major wrong actions and then repents and makes amends, He \nwill pardon Him by His favor and generosity. Small wrong actions \nare expiated by avoiding major ones.  \n \n1.5e Those who do not repent are subject to His will  \n \nThose who do not repent of their major wrong actions \nbecome subject to His will. \"He does not forgive anything \nbeing associated with Him, but He forgives anything other \nthan that to whoever He wills.\"  \n \nThose believers who commit major wrong actions and die without \nrepenting of them are subject to the Will of Allah. If He wishes, He \nwill forgive them out of His favor. If He wishes, He will punish \nthem out of justice. He may forgive everything except for \nassociating others with Him.  \n \n1.5f Deliverance from the Fire because of belief  \n \nThose He punishes with His Fire, He will remove from it \nbecause of any belief they have and by this He will cause \nthem to enter His Garden. \"Whoever does an atom's weight \nof good will see it.\" (Holy Qur’an 99:7)  \n \nIt must also be accepted that if Allah azza wa jall wills that the \nrebels among the believers be punished in the Abode of \nPunishment, their punishment will be commensurate with what \nthey have brought on themselves by their evil deeds and then \nmercy will envelop them and they will emerge from the Abode of \nPunishment and enter the Abode of Peace. Whoever has the \nweight of atom of belief in his heart will not be in the Fire forever. \nThus belief is a reason for not being forever in the Punishment \nand a reason for entering the Garden with Allah azza wa jall's \npardon and mercy.  \n \n1.5g The Intercession of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \nAny of the community of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) who have committed major wrong actions and for \nwhom he intercedes, will be brought out of the Fire by his \nintercession.  \n \nThe intercession of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nothers must be affirmed. He is singled out for mention because he \nis the first intercessor and by the intercession of our Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) the people of major wrong actions of his \ncommunity of unifiers will emerge from the Fire. The Mu'tazilites \ndeny intercession, based on the lack of permission to pardon and \noverlook wrong actions, but we defer to transmitted evidence and \nthey hold to merely logical evidence. Transmitted evidence is more \nsublime and radiant.  \n \n1.6 The Afterlife: the Garden and the Fire  \n \n1.6a The Garden  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has created the Garden and has made it \nready as an everlasting abode for His friends (awliya'). He \nwill honor them in it with the vision of His Noble Face. \nThis is the same Garden from which He sent down Nabi \nAdam (alaihi salam), His Prophet and Khalif, to the earth, \nwhich was as it had already been decreed in His \nforeknowledge.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has created the everlasting abode of the Garden \nfor the believers in which they will have no toil or fatigue, but will \nbe rejoicing and will be blessed by contemplation of His Face. See \nHoly Qur‟an 75:23.  \n \n1.6b The Fire  \n \nHe has created the Fire and has made it ready as an \neverlasting abode for those who disbelieve in him and deny \nHis signs and Books and Messengers (may He bless them \nall) and He keeps them veiled from seeing Him.  \n \nHe created the Fire as an eternal abode of punishment for those \nwho deny and reject Him and ignored the evidence which \nindicates the existence and oneness of the Creator and denied His \nrevealed Books and Messengers (may He bless them all). They will \nabide in the hatred resulting from disbelief and will be veiled from \nseeing their Lord on that day.  \n \n1.7 Details of the Resurrection  \n \n1.7a The Coming of Allah azza wa jall and the Angels  \n \nAllah azza wa jall will come on the Day of Rising together \nwith the angels, rank upon rank.  \n \nIt is confirmed by transmission that on the Day of Resurrection \nAllah azza wa jall will come with angels in ranks. That must be \nbelieved, and its knowledge comes from the Lawgiver. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others say about this ayat (Holy \nQur‟an 89:22) and others that they are read as they have come \nwithout qualification. We take what they say literally but do not \ncompare it to any creature.  \n \n1.7b Presentation of Peoples  \n \nAll the different peoples are confronted with their \naccounts and their punishment or reward.  \n \nAll the different peoples will come to present themselves so that \ntheir states will be investigated and reckoning taken for their \nactions. The actions of those who present themselves for the \nReckoning will have their good and bad actions enumerated.  The \nbeliever will be called to account with graciousness and favor and \nthe hypocrite and unbeliever with evidence and justice. So Allah \nazza wa jall will say to the believer, \"I veiled it for you in the \nworld and I forgive it for you on the Day of Rising.\" The \nunbelievers will be reckoned in front of witnesses and those who \nthey denied will be summoned to their Lord, \"The curse of Allah \non wrongdoers.\"  \n \n1.7c The Balance  \n \nThe balances will be set up to weigh people's actions - \n\"Whoever’s actions are heavy in the balance - they are the \nsuccessful.\"  \n \nSee Holy Qur‟an 21:47; 101:6. The balances will be set up to \nmanifest justice so that no one will be wronged even the weight of \na mustard grain. Allah azza wa jall will bring all the person's \nactions, even to an atom's weight, on the Day of Resurrection. \nWhoever has his balance heavy will be successful and achieve a \nhappiness after which there will be no misery. Whoever has his \nbalance light will be wretched and will have no happiness after his \nwretchedness.  \n \n1.7d The Books of Actions  \n \nPeople will be given pages on which their actions are \nrecorded - \"Whoever is given his book in his right hand will \nbe given an easy accounting and whoever is given his book \nbehind his back - they will burn in a Fire.\" (Holy Qur’an \n84:7-13)  \n \nNations will be given their pages which contain their actions. \nWhen they are given them, Allah azza wa jall will create \nknowledge in them and they will understand what they contain. If \nsomeone is given his book in his right hand, that indicates that he \nis one of the people of the right hand and happiness. If someone is \ngiven his book in his left hand, that is an indication that he is one \nof the people of misery.\" The receiving of the books should actually \nbe put before the balance and weighing of actions because the \nweighing is after the Reckoning and the Reckoning is after \nreceiving the Books.  \n \n1.7e The Sirat  \n \nThe Bridge (sirat) is true and people will cross it according \nto their actions. Those who cross it, and achieve safety \nfrom the Fire, do so at different speeds, while the actions \nof others cast them to their destruction in the Fire.  \n \nThere is a great deal of description of the Sirat and it is said that \nit is finer than a hair and sharper than a sword. Shaikh al-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), on the other hand, says that it is wide with \ntwo paths on it, one to the right and one to the left. The people of \nhappiness travel on the right and the people of wretchedness on \nthe left.  \n \nThere are ropes on it and each rope leads to one of the levels of \nJahannam and Jahannam lies between the creatures and the \nGarden. The Sirat is set up over Jahannam, and none of the \npeople of the Garden enters the Garden until he has crossed over \nthe Sirat.  \n \nPeople will cross over the Sirat according to the disparity in their \nactions and avoidance of the things forbidden by Allah azza wa \njall. Some will pass over like lightning. Some will escape the \nhooks, some will be scratched but released, and some will be \ncaught by the hooks and tipped into the Fire of Jahannam.  \n \n1.7f The Basin  \n \nAlso included is belief in the Basin (Hawd) of the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) which his community will \ncome down to drink from after which they will never feel \nthirst again. But those who make any changes or \nalterations in the din will be driven from it.  \n \nIt is necessary to believe in the Basin of the Rasulullah (alaihi \nsalat wa salam). He will drive away from it those who alter things, \nlike the apostates and those of his followers who follow him with \nthe best will drink from it when they leave their graves thirsty. \nWhoever drinks from it will never feel thirst again.  \n \n1.8 Belief  \n \n1.8a Definition of Belief  \n \nBelief consists of what you say with the tongue, what you \nbelieve sincerely in the heart, and what you do with the \nlimbs.  \n \nBelief is articulation of the shahadah, belief in the truthfulness of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and what he brought in \nthe heart and then acting according to the judgments of the \nShari‟ah, like praying and fasting. Someone with all of these three \nis a believer. If someone believes that belief does not consist of \nthese three and imagines that what the author said was due to his \ninclination to what belief obliges because there is consensus that \nsomeone who believes with his heart, speaks with his tongue and \nacts with his limbs is a believer. If he does not believe that belief \nconsists of these three, he takes it as a preface to the words which \nfollow:  \n \n1.8b Increase and Decrease of Belief  \n \nIt increases when your actions increase and decreases \nwhen they decrease. So it is through actions or the lack of \nthem that increase and decrease in belief occurs.  \n \nIt increases according to actions and decreases according to \nactions. This increase and decrease is in relation to its fruits. This \nis the school of the early and later people of the community, and \nthis is the final position taken in the matter by Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He first had said that it increases and does \nnot decrease. Applying the name “belief\" to action is agreed upon. \nThe Almighty says, \"Allah would not let your belief go to waste,\" \nwhich referred to the prayers they did facing Jerusalem.  \n \n1.8c The intention and following the Sunnah  \n \nThe statement of belief is not complete without action. \nNeither the statement nor action are complete without \nintention. And neither the statement nor intention are \ncomplete unless they are in accordance with the sunnah.  \n \nActions and words are according to intentions. The intention is the \nfulcrum upon which actions are based, and so a man should only \nbase his actions on the pure sunnah and straight Shari‟ah and \nfollow the Rightly-guided khalifs (may Allah azza wa jall be \npleased with them).  \n \n1.8d Islam and Wrong actions  \n \nNo Muslim becomes an unbeliever (kafir) through wrong \nactions.  \n \nIt must be believed that no Muslim who commits a wrong action \nbecomes an unbeliever as long as he believes. The same applies to \nsomeone who commits acts of disobedience while he nevertheless \nbelieves that the Shari‟ah forbids them. If someone does \nsomething which shows that he lacks belief, like throwing a copy \nof the Holy Qur'an into the rubbish, then he is an apostate. We are \nnot discussing him. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Whoever faces our qibla and eats our sacrifices is truly a \nbeliever.\" The Kharijites were heretics when they said that every \nsin is a major wrong action and every major wrong action removes \nactions and the one who does that is an unbeliever. The \nMu'tazilites said that every major wrong action renders actions \nvoid and the one who commits it is between two stations, and he is \nnot called a believer or an unbeliever. He is called a deviant \n(fasiq).  \n \n1.8e Martyrs  \n \nMartyrs (shuhada') are alive, receiving their provision in \nthe presence of their Lord.  \n \nIt is obligatory to believe that the martyrs, those who fought the \nunbelievers and were killed in the way of Allah azza wa jall to \nelevate the word of Allah azza wa jall, are alive and delighting in \nthe Presence of their Lord because of the privileges they have been \ngranted, one of which is that they will be secure from the Greatest \nTerror on the Day of Rising. See Holy Qur'an 3:169.  \n \n1.8f In the grave: the spirits of the fortunate \n \nThe spirits of the fortunate remain in bliss until the day \nthey are raised again.  \n \nThe souls of the fortunate will remain in bliss until the Day of \nRising seeing their place in the Garden. When one of them dies, he \nis shown his place in the Garden morning and evening.  \n \n1.8g In the grave: the spirits of the miserable  \n \nThe spirits of the miserable are tormented until the Day of \nJudgment.  \n \nThe souls of the wretched are punished by seeing their place in \nthe Fire and other punishments.  \n \n1.8h The questioning in the grave  \n \nThe believers are tried and questioned in their graves. \n\"Allah makes those who believe firm by giving them firm \nwords in the life of this world and the next world.\"  \n \nThis refers to the questioning by the two angels in the grave. The \ndead person will be placed in his grave and people will leave him \nand then two angels come and sit with him and ask him, \"Who is \nyour Lord? What is your din? Who is your Prophet?\" The believer \nwill reply, \"My Lord is Allah azza wa jall. My din is Islam, My \nProphet is Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam),\" and his grave will \nbe wide for him. When the unbeliever is in the grave and is asked \nthese questions, he will reply, \"I do not know,\" and so he will be \ndealt a blow from an iron hammer and will scream so that all \ncreatures except men and jinn will hear him. Also reported is the \nconstriction of the grave, which is the pressing on the sides of the \nbody of the dead person and none is safe from that except the one \nwhom Allah azza wa jall grants an exception - they include \nFatima bint Asad (radhi’Allahu anha) the mother of 'Ali ibn Abi \nTalib (radhi’Allahu anhu) because of the blessing of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) going into her grave, and whoever \nrecites Surat al-Ikhlas in his final illness.\"  \n \n1.9 The Angels \n \n1.9a The Recording Angels  \n \nPeople have recording angels over them who write down \ntheir actions. Nothing people do escapes the knowledge of \ntheir Lord.  \n \nMen and jinn, believers and unbelievers, free and slave, have \nrecording angels who write down their actions, even the \npermissible ones and the groan in illness, and even the actions of \nthe heart, like all the thoughts which occur to it. Allah azza wa \njall has given the heart a token by which it can distinguish \nbetween the good and bad action. The source for the knowledge of \nthat is the words of the Almighty, \"Standing over you are \nguardians, noble, recording. They know everything you do,\" (Holy \nQur‟an 82:10-12) and the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam), \"The angels of the day and night succeed one another.\" \nThere is consensus on that. None of the actions are hidden from \nAllah azza wa jall. That is part of the subtlety of Allah azza wa \njall regarding His slaves since they know that Allah azza wa jall \nhas recording angels who record their actions and that will \nprevent them from acts of disobedience and the proof will be \nestablished against them when they reject and deny.  \n \n1.9b The Angel of Death  \n \nThe angel of death seizes people's spirits by the permission \nof his Lord.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has delegated an angel called 'Azra'il (alaihi \nsalam) to take the spirits of creatures, men, jinn and other birds \nand all animals who have a spirit. The Almighty says, \"Allah \ntakes back all souls at the time of their death,\" (Holy Qur‟an \n39:42) and He says, \"Then when death comes to one of you, Our \nmessengers take him,\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:61) however the outward \nappearance differs from this. The action is ascribed to Allah azza \nwa jall because He is the one who does it in reality, and the \nattribution of taking the spirits is to the Angel of Death \n \nbecause he does it directly by the permission of Allah azza wa jall. \nTaking is ascribed to the angels who are messengers because they \nassist the Angel of Death (alaihi salam) in taking the spirits.  \n \n1.10 Authorities  \n \n1.10a The Best generation  \n \nThe best generation are those who saw the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and believed in him. Then those who \nfollowed them and then those who followed them.  \n \nThe best generation is those who were alive in the time of the \nHoly Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) and believed in \nhim, respected and helped and followed the Light which was sent \ndown with him and the suns of his prophethood shone on them \nand they won and chose the virtue of being a Companion. Their \ngeneration is the best generation. This is in accordance with his \nwords, \"The best of you is my generation and those who follow \nthem and then those who follow them.  \n \n1.10b The best Companions  \n \nThe best of the Companions (Sahaba) are the rightly-\nguided khalifs. Firstly, Abu Bakr (radhi’Allahu anhu), then \n'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu), then 'Uthman (radhi’Allahu \nanhu), then 'Ali (radhi’Allahu anhu). \n  \nNot all the Companions had the same degree, but they varied in \ntheir degrees of excellence. The Rightly-guided Khalifs are the \nbest and in order of excellence they were Abu Bakr, then 'Umar, \nthen 'Uthman, then 'Ali, may Allah azza wa jall be pleased with \nall of them.  \n \n1.10c Respect for all the Companions  \n \nNone of the Companions of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) should be mentioned except in the best way and \nsilence \nshould \nbe \nmaintained \nconcerning \nany \ndisagreements that broke out between them. They are the \npeople who are most worthy of being considered in the \nbest light possible and the people whose opinions should \nbe most respected.  \n \nOne should avoid getting embroiled in the quarrels between them \nand one must always take the best interpretation in holding an \nopinion regarding them. They must always be thought about in \nthe best possible light.  \n \n1.10d Those in authority  \n \nObedience to the leaders of the Muslims, both their rulers \nand their men of knowledge, is obligatory.  \n \nIt is obligatory to obey the Imams of the Muslims who are in \nauthority who are responsible for the best interests of the \nMuslims. If they command what is correct, it is obligatory to obey, \nand if they forbid the reprehensible, it is obligatory to refrain. It is \nonly obligatory to obey the scholars who act by their knowledge \nand command the correct and forbid the reprehensible and \npreserve the limits of Allah azza wa jall. The evidence for the \nobligation is the words of the Almighty, \"Obey Allah and obey the \nMessenger and those in command among you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:58) \nThe one who transgresses is not obeyed because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no obedience due to a \ncreature which involves disobedience to the Creator.\" (Imam ibn \nHanbal (radhi’Allahu anhu) & Shaikh al-Hakim (radhi’Allahu \nanhu) \n \n1.10e The Salaf  \n \nIt is also obligatory to follow the Right-acting Companions, \nto tread in their footsteps and ask forgiveness for them.  \n \nIt is obliged to follow the righteous Salaf who are the Companions, \nin their words and actions, whether it is learned from them or by \nderivation and ijtihad. Similarly one must pray for forgiveness for \nthem.  \n \n1.10f Avoiding Disputation  \n \nIt is also obligatory to avoid wrangling and argumentation \nregarding the din  \n \nIt is necessary to avoid wrangling and arguments about the din. \nWrangling is to deny the truth after it is clear. Argumentation is \nto quarrel with the people of innovations. That is forbidden \nbecause it could lead to attacking the Companions (may Allah \nazza wa jall bless them all) and cause doubt in the heart. If the \naim of the argument is to set forth the truth without obduracy \n(stubbornness), then it is permitted.  \n \n1.10g Avoiding Innovations  \n \n...and to avoid every new thing which people have \nintroduced into it.  \n \nAvoid innovations because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"If anyone innovates something in this business of \nours which is not part of it, it is rejected.\" This is applied to \ninnovations which did not occur in his time and which the \nShari‟ah indicates are unlawful, according to some. Some believe \nthat innovation is what did not occur in this time, whether the \nShari‟ah indicates that it is unlawful, obligatory, recommended, \ndisliked or permitted. Innovations are found in all five categories. \nThis is what is stated by Shaikh ibn Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others.  \n \nMay Allah azza wa jall bless and give much peace to our \nMaster Muhammad, His Prophet, and his family and his \nwives and his descendants.  \n \n \n \nChapter Two: What Necessitates Wudu' and \nGhusl \n \n \nThis chapter deals with those things which render necessary \nwudu' and ghusl.  \n \nWudu' designates the action and wadu' designates the water. \nLinguistically it means cleanliness and excellence, and in the \nShari‟ah it means to purify certain parts of the body with water to \nmake them clean and to remove the judgment of 'minor impurity\" \n(hadath) from them to permit acts of worship which are forbidden \nby lack of purity.  \n \nQadi ibn al-'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that there is a known \ndispute about whether ghasl means the action and ghusl the \nwater. However, in adh-Dhakira, ghusl designates the action and \nghasl the water. This is the most common position.  \n \nThe obligation of Wudu' and Ghusl  \n \nEvidence for the obligatory nature of wudu' and ghusl is found in \nthe Holy Qur'an and Sunnah and consensus. The Almighty says, \n\"O you who believe! When you get up intending to do the prayer, \nwash your faces \" (Holy Qur‟an 5:6) and \"Do not approach the \nprayer when you are drunk until you know what you are saying, \nnor in a state of major impurity - unless you are traveling - until \nyou have washed yourselves completely.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:43) The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah azza wa jall does \nnot accept the prayer of anyone in a state of impurity until he does \nwudu'.\" There is no disagreement between the Imams that it is \nobligatory.  \n \n2.1 Wudu'  \n \n2.1a Preconditions for wudu':  \n \nThere are certain preconditions for the validity of wudu':  \n \n1. Islam  \n \n2. Adulthood  \n \n3. Sanity  \n \n4. Absence of menstrual blood or bleeding after childbirth  \n \n5. The arrival of the time of the prayer,  \n \n6. That the legally responsible person is not forgetful, asleep or \ninsensible  \n \n7. The existence of adequate water to perform it  \n \n8. The possibility of doing it with due care to achieve what is \ndesired, which may preclude the sick and the person who is \ncompelled.  \n \n2.1b What makes wudu' necessary  \n \nTwo things oblige wudu': ritual impurity and certain causes. \n[Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says three things: ritual \nimpurities, causes; and apostasy and doubt.]  \n \nRitual impurity is what breaks wudu' in itself, like urine, and \ncauses are things which do not break wudu' in themselves but \nleads to ritual impurity, like loss of sanity, touching someone with \ndesire and touching the penis. Shaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) states that apostasy also breaks wudu'.  \n \n2.1c The nature of the obligation  \n \nThe duty of wudu' is one of an obligatory nature, not merely an \nobligation inasmuch as it is Sunnah and thus strongly \nrecommended.  \n \n2.1d Urination and defecation in a normal manner  \n \nWudu' must be done when something emerges from one of the two \nnormal passages, the urethra and the anus, in a normal manner. \nIt is limited to what is normal which excludes anything which \nemerges abnormally, like pebbles and worms. They do not break \nwudu', even if he passes some urine and feces. Urine and feces \nmust emerge in a normal manner. So if it emerges for a specific \nreason, like incontinence in most cases, which is when he does it \nconstantly, most of the time or half of the time, then it does not \nbreak wudu'. In the first case, wudu' is neither obligatory or \nrecommended. In the last two cases it is recommended unless that \nis difficult for him.  \n \nThe 'passages' are limited to what emerges normally, which \nprecludes what emerges other than urine and feces, like blood as a \nresult of leeches and cupping, vomit which is changed from food, \nand impurity which emerges from a split under the intestines \nwhich is not due to the passages being blocked. When the two \npassages are blocked and the split is located under the intestines, \nthen it is considered as a normal orifice.  \n \n2.2 Things which break wudu'  \n \n2.2a Excreta which oblige wudu'  \n \nYou have to do wudu' after urinating or defecating or \npassing wind.  \n \nThis clarifies what excreta which make wudu' necessary: urine \nfrom the front orifice and feces from the rear orifice and passing \nwind, which designates wind which emerges from the anus, \nwhether or not with a sound. As for wind which emerges from the \npenis or vagina, it does not require wudu' since it is not considered \nas one of things which break wudu'.  \n \n2.2b Other fluids which require wudu': Madhy  \n \nYou have to do wudu' when the liquid known as madhy \ncomes out of the penis, in which case it is necessary to \nwash to the whole penis as well. Madhy is a thin, white \nliquid which comes out at times of sexual excitement when \nthe penis is erect, either during sexual foreplay or when \nthinking about it.  \n \nWudu' is obliged when madhy emerges from the penis. It is also \nobligatory to wash the entire penis with an intention before doing \nwudu'. Wudu' is specified and using stones in not enough.  \n \n2.2c Wady  \n \nWady is a thick white liquid which comes out usually after \nurinating and carries the same judgment regarding \ncleaning the penis as urine.  \n \nWady is dense and usually comes out after urination. It may come \nout on its own or during urination. It makes wudu' necessary and \nit must be completely removed. He should lightly squeeze the \nplace and wash only its place.  \n \n2.2d Sperm (maniyy)  \n \nSperm - maniyy - is the white liquid ejaculated at orgasm \nduring sexual intercourse which smells similar to the \npollen of the date-palm.  \n \nThe emission of sperm is one of things which obliges ghusl, not \nwudu'. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it here among \nthe things which oblige wudu' as a digression since it does oblige \nwudu' in certain cases. It is what issues with pleasure which is not \nusual, although it is mentioned among the things which oblige \nghusl. Here he mentioned the fluids which flow from the front \norifice, and maniyy is one of them. It is ejaculated in spurts and \nhas a particular odor.  \n \n2.2e Women's discharge and menstruation  \n \nThe liquid which comes from a woman is a thin yellow \nfluid and necessitates purification, that is purification of \nthe whole body as is the case after menstruation.  \n \nA woman's liquid which she discharges, which is her maniyy, is \ndescribed as being thin and yellowish when it normally emerges \nand in health, not on account of illness or incontinence. Ghusl is \nobliged on account of it. It is not a precondition that it emerge \noutside. It is based on the sensation, and so the mere sensation \nobliges her to purify herself, as she is obliged to do when \nmenstruation ends.  \n \n2.2f False menstruation  \n \nIn the case of bleeding which continues beyond the normal \nperiod of menstruation (istihada), only wudu' is necessary, \nalthough in such circumstances it is recommended for a \nwoman to repeat wudu' for every prayer.  \n \nThe blood of false menstruation is blood which flows outside the \ndays of menstruation and lochia, issuing from a vein which is in \nthe lower part of the uterus. The judgment in such a case is that \nwudu' is obligatory when it stops more than it comes. When it \ncomes more than it stops or the two are equal, then she is not \nobliged to do wudu'.  \n \nMenstruation according to Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe normal age of menstruation is considered from the age of \nadolescence to the age of 50. The individual is consulted from the \nage of 9 to puberty and from 50 to 70. It can be red, yellow or \nbrown. The minimum is one gush and its maximum is fifteen \ndays. The minimum of purity is fifteen days and it has no \nmaximum. And the maximum length of menstruation for someone \nwith normal periods (even if she has only had one period) is fifteen \ndays. There are three days of using precaution (i.e. above and \nbeyond) her normal maximum. (i.e. if she normally menstruates \nfive days and then menstruates after that and it does not stop \nafter the full five days, she adds three days to it. If it does not stop \nafter that, it is false menstruation.  \n \nBut if her normal period is 15 days, she does not use precaution at \nall. This is as long as it does not exceed half a month. (If it is 14, \nshe uses one, and if 13, she uses 2.) Then she is pure (to fast, pray \nand have intercourse even if the blood is flowing, because it is \nfalse menstruation and not menstruation.)  \n \nThe maximum length of menstruation of a pregnant woman after \nthree months (up until five months) is half a month and five days \n(i.e. twenty days). When she starts the sixth month, it is twenty \ndays and the like (i.e. ten with the twenty and so the maximum is \nthirty days). Is the judgment of the woman whose has a period \nbefore three months the same as the judgment of a woman whose \nperiod comes after it  (after three months), or is she like the one \nwith a regular period? There are two statements. If purity is \nstopped by blood before it is completely finished, even by a hour, \nshe adds only the days of bleeding (i.e. rather than the days it \nstopped, and it cancels it when it is less than half a month. There \nmust be 15 twenty-four days of continuous purity free of blood by \nagreement.  \n \nThen, after patches and continuous blood, it is false menstruation, \nnot menstruation. So she does ghusl for the end of menstruation. \nThe one who has bleeding patches does the ghusl whenever the \nblood stops in the patched days unless she thinks that the blood \nwill return before the time she is in finishes. In such a case she is \nnot commanded to do ghusl. She fasts (if it stops at Fajr or before) \nand prays and has intercourse after ghusl according to the known \nposition as opposed to the author of the Irshad who says that \nintercourse is not permitted. She can pray in all the days of \nmenstruation when the period comes to her at night and then \nstops before Fajr. So she might not miss a prayer or a fast.  \n \nBlood which is distinct (from false menstrual blood by the change \nof smell, color or fineness or thickness) after (the full 15 days of) \npurity is menstruation (and prevents prayer and the like). If it is \nnot distinct from false menstruation in any way, it is false \nmenstruation, even if it goes on a long time. It is like that for what \nis distinct before the end of purity. One does not pay attention to \nthe distinction. If the blood is distinct from the blood of false \nmenstruation by anything above and is judged to be menstruation \nand it continues until her normal time is complete and more, is \nchanges from the quality of the blood of menstruation to that of \nfalse menstruation. So she does not use caution beyond her \nnormal days, but does ghusl by the simple completion of her \nnormal days according to the soundest version (from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi).)  \n \nPurity from menstruation is known by the dryness (of the private \nparts) from blood, yellowness and brownness when she inserts a \nbit of cotton, for instance, and brings it out without seeing \nanything on it. Or it is by a white liquid which issues from the \nprivate parts after the end of menstruation. This liquid is more \nconclusive of the end of menstruation than dryness for the one \nwho usually has it. If she sees the liquid before dryness, it is \nrecommended that she do ghusl at the end of the preferred time \n(for the prayer). There is some discussion about the sign of purity \nof the one whose has her first period. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that she is only pure by dryness which she sees, even \nif the time for the prayer goes by.  \n \nThe woman with a period does not have to look for her purity \nbefore Fajr. (Indeed, it is disliked because it is not something \nwhich the Salaf did.) She should look when she goes to sleep to see \nwhether she can catch Maghrib and Isha' and fast. She should \nlook at the beginning of Subh and the other five prayers (allowing \ntime for ghusl).  \n \nMenstruation prevents the validity of prayer and fasting and their \nobligation and divorce (which is prohibited, but is binding if it \ntakes place.) It prevents the start of idda, which begins with \npurity. It prevents intercourse or touching under the waist-\nwrapper (from the waist to knees), even after the end of the period \nbefore the ghusl. Tayammum makes the prayer permitted, but \ndoes not remove the impurity. It prevents entering the masjid, so \nthere is no itikaf or tawaf. It prevents touching a copy of the Holy \nQur'an (except for a teacher or student who has a dispensation) \nand recitation.  \n \n2.2g Incontinence of Urine  \n \nThis is also the case for incontinence (salas) of urine. \n  \nIt is recommended for someone with incontinence to do wudu' for \nevery prayer and for his wudu' to be directly before the prayer. \nThere is no special judgment for incontinence of urine. It is a \ngeneral judgment for everyone with some form of incontinence, be \nit urine, wind, or maniyy. All are the same in that they do not \nbreak wudu' by what emerges from them and are constant, even if \nit is only half the time when he is unable to remove it by medical \ntreatment or marriage. If someone is able to stop it, then it breaks \nhis wudu', he is excused for the period of treatment in that it does \nnot break it.  \n \n2.2h Loss of Consciousness: deep sleep  \n \nYou have to do wudu' after loss of consciousness caused by \ndeep sleep,  \n \nLoss of consciousness is one of the reasons which lead to ritual \nimpurity and obliges wudu' after it passes. The loss of intellect is \nwhen it is completely absent. When it departs completely, as in \nsleep or fainting, and then is restored to him, the judgment is that \nwudu' is obligatory. A deep sleep, whether long or short, breaks \nwudu' absolutely. A deep sleep that in which the sleeper is not \naware of what he or someone else does. What is understood from \nthe word \"deep\" is that the dozing in which the person is aware of \nthe slightest thing definitely does not break wudu', be that short \nor long based on what is in Sahih Muslim, \"The Companions of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to sleep and then pray \nwithout doing wudu'.\" Nonetheless, it is recommended to do wudu' \nafter a long light sleep.   \n \n2.2i Fainting  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that someone who faints \nhas to do wudu'. Fainting is an illness in the head.  \n \n2.2j Drunkenness or intoxication  \n \nThe one who loses his senses through drunkenness must do wudu'. \nIt makes no difference whether he becomes intoxicated by \nsomething lawful or unlawful, as when he drinks milk thinking \nthat it is not intoxicating and it intoxicates him. \n \n2.2k Insanity or a bout of madness.  \n \nThis even more clearly breaks wudu' because it removes the \nsenses. It is not in itself a reason for it. Wudu' is obliged on \naccount of insanity, intoxication and fainting because it is obliged \nby sleep which is less severe than it because it removes a little \nawareness, and these cause that loss of intellect even more so and \nso it is more likely that it be obligatory on account of them. That is \nwhy there is no difference between long or short, deep or light. \nThey judge that legal responsibility is removed with them which is \nnot the case with sleep. The sleeper is responsible, even if he \nincurs no wrong action. This discussion concerns a bout of \nmadness which ends. The one for whom insanity is complete and \nwithout end owes nothing.  \n \n2.2l Wudu' on account touching a person  \n \nWudu' is also necessary when you touch someone to gain \nsexual pleasure or have bodily contact with them for the \nsame reason  \n \nOne of the causes which results in ritual impurity is touching \nwhich is less than intercourse as the Companions, Tabi‟un, Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and his companions have explained it. \nThe Almighty says, \"Or if you have touched women.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n4:43) 'Ali (radhi’Allahu anhu)  and Ibn 'Abbas (radhi’Allahu \nanhu), however, explain this 'touching' as referring to intercourse, \nand say that His words \"Or you have touched women\" means to \nhave intercourse with them.  \n \nSpecifying 'pleasure' tells us that if the one who touches intends \npleasure, he must do wudu' simply by touching whether or not \nthere is pleasure. So that is even more so if he touches and \nexperiences it. If he did not intend pleasure, but intended to touch \nto find out whether the body was hard or not, and then \nexperiences pleasure, he must do wudu' because of the existence of \npleasure, even though it did not come from intention. So the \nobligation of wudu' hinges on intention, even if there was no \nfeeling while touching. If the feeling occurs after touching, then it \nis like pleasure arising from thinking for which nothing is obliged. \nIf he does not intend pleasure and does not feel it, he does not \nhave to do anything. This is the judgment for touching.  \n \nAs for anyone who is touched, if they are adult and experience \npleasure, they must do wudu'. Otherwise, they do not have to do \nanything if they did not intend pleasure. Otherwise the judgment \nregarding the person who is touched is the same as the one who \ntouches.  \n \n2.2m Wudu' on account of kissing  \n \nor for kissing them for sexual pleasure.  \n \nIt is clear from his words that kissing is general, whether on the \nmouth or elsewhere with the intention or arousal. That is not the \ncase. The accepted position is that the kiss on the mouth generally \nbreaks wudu' whether or not there is intention and arousal \nbecause it is a probable cause of pleasure unless other places give \nrise to pleasure. [Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if \nit is to bid farewell or out of mercy, as when there is some \nmisfortune, it does not break wudu'.] Looking at someone, even \nwith pleasure, does not break wudu'.  \n \n2.2n Touching the Human genitals  \n \nA man must do wudu' if he touches his penis.  \n \nOne of the things which lead to ritual impurity is touching the \npenis because it says in the Muwatta' and elsewhere that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When one of you touches his \npenis, he should do wudu'.\" The touching referred to is with the \npalm or the inside or sides of the fingers. He only mentioned \ntouching one's own penis. As for the penis of someone else, it \nfollows the judgment regarding touching with respect to intention \nor arousal. The penis must be connected to the body. As for that \nwhich is separate from the body, it does not break wudu' when it \nis touched.  \n \nWhen dealing with the eunuch, one considers the shape or lack of \nit. If there is a shape, then touching it breaks wudu. If it does not \nhave a shape, then one takes into consideration the judgment \ngiven to it. If masculinity is adjudged for him, it breaks wudu' and \notherwise it does not.  \n \nThere are different considerations regarding touching it through a \nbarrier. If it is thick, that does not break wudu' in one position, If \nit is light, then the most accepted position is that it does break it. \nTouching the anus or the testicles does not break wudu' in the \naccepted position.  \n \n2.2o A woman touching her vagina  \n \nBut there is difference of opinion about whether a woman \nhas to do wudu' if she touches her vagina.  \n \nThe position of the Mudawwana is that it does not break wudu' \nbased on what is on the hadith, \"When one of you touches his \npenis, he should do wudu'.\" The position is based on the fact that \nthat is what is understood by the word and when something is \nunderstood, a concealed meaning is not considered. The one who \nsays that it does break wudu' bases it on the hadith which says, \"If \nsomeone's hand touches his private parts he should do wudu'\" \nbecause 'private parts' and can be applied to the penis or the \nvagina. Some of them say that wudu' is not broken it if she \ntouches the outside of it, but it is broken if she presses it or puts \nher hand inside the labia.  \n \n2.2p Further Note  \n \nShaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi alaihi): Things that break wudu' \nin other schools, but not in the Maliki school are: vomiting, \nbelching, nosebleeds or other bleeding, cupping, the emission of \npus, laughing in the prayer [Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi)], eating camel meat, eating cooked food, carrying the dead \nperson, slaughtering animals. None of these break wudu'. \n  \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): It is recommended to wash \nout the mouth after eating meat or drinking milk.  \n \n2.3 Ghusl (Full Ablution)  \n \n2.3a Ghusl because of emission of sperm  \n \nYou have to do ghusl when, as has already been mentioned, \nsperm (maniyy) is ejaculated accompanied by sexual \npleasure either during sleep or when awake whether from \na man or woman.  \n \nOne of the things which oblige ghusl is the emission of sperm with \nnormal pleasure, whether while asleep or awake, or man or \nwoman. It is not a precondition for the obligation of ghusl that it \nemerge with pleasure when it actually takes place. Ghusl is \nobliged simply by its emerging after pleasure has departed, as \nwhen he has pleasure without intercourse and then sperm \nemerges from him after the pleasure is over.  \n \n2.3b At the end of menstruation and lochia  \n \nGhusl is also necessary at the end of bleeding from \nmenstruation. \n  \nIt is more precise to say 'the blood of menstruation' because it is \nmore general than simply saying 'menstrual period' since that \nspecifically designates that which is preceded by purity and \nfollowed by purity. The beginning or end of the blood which \nemerges is not called 'a menstrual period'. In the Shari‟ah, the \nblood of menstruation is that which emerges on its own from the \nvagina which normally does not exceed 15 days and it emerges \nwithout being caused by illness or childbirth. Blood which emerges \nnot by some cause, or which emerges from the anus, or emerges \nfrom a child of seven or a woman of 70, or which exceeds 15 days, \nor which emerges because of illness, or because of childbirth is not \nmenstruation so that its judgments apply to it.  \n \n2.3c False menstruation or menorrhagia  \n \nGhusl is necessary when abnormal bleeding (istihada) \nstops  \n \nThen the sensation of the blood of false menstruation was made a \ncause which obliges ghusl. Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nfinal position was that ghusl was recommended. He first said that \nshe does not have a ghusl. None of the people of the school say \nthat it is obligatory except for Shaikh Al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) if one takes his transmission literally.  \n \n2.3d Lochia  \n \nGhusl is necessary at the end of the period of bleeding \nwhich follows childbirth (nifas).  \n \nLochia is one of the causes which makes ghusl obligatory. Lochia \n(nifas) linguistically means childbirth, whether there is blood with \nit or not. It designates the blood itself which emerges from the \nvagina because of childbirth. In the usage of the people of Shari‟ah \nit designates the blood which emerges from the vagina because of \nchildbirth in a healthy and normal way. The blood which emerges \nfrom other than the vagina is not nifas. That which emerges not \non account of childbirth is not considered nifas. That which does \nnot emerge in a healthy manner is not nifas. That would normally \nbe bleeding which occurs is after the period of nifas, which is 60 \ndays.  \n \n2.3e Penetration of the vagina  \n \nGhusl must also be done if the head of the penis penetrates \nthe vagina even if no ejaculation takes place.  \n \nOne of the things which obliges ghusl is the penetration of the \npenis of the adult into the vagina, even if there is no ejaculation, \nwhether it is human or animal, or into the anus, whether female \nor male, whether or not there is emission, and whether or not \nthere is a covering over it, but that is provided that the barrier is \nlight so that pleasure can be felt with it. As for the thick barrier, \nghusl is not obliged with it unless there is ejaculation. Then there \nis ghusl because of ejaculation, not because of the disappearance \nof the penis. The basis for that is what is in the Muwatta' and \nSahih Muslim from the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam), \"When he sits between her arms and legs and then presses \nher, he is obliged to do ghusl.” This hadith is abrogated by what \nSahih Muslim related from the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam), \"When you are too quick or there is no \nejaculation, there is no ghusl, “and by what was related from his \nwords, \"Water is needed on account of water [semen].\"  \n \n2.4 Legal Consequences of vaginal penetration  \n \n2.4a Ghusl is obligatory  \n \nThis penetration of the vagina by the head of the penis \nnecessitates ghusl .  \n \n2.4b Legal consequences in case of fornication  \n \nIt necessitates the hadd punishment [for zina] and the \npayment of the dowry and gives the married couples the \nstatus of being muhsan and makes a woman who has gone \nthrough a triple divorce halal for her original husband and \ninvalidates hajj and fasting.  \n \nIt obliges the hadd punishment for fornication and obliges the \npayment of the dower in full because the contract on its own \ndemands half of the dower. It accords the married couple the \nstates of being muhsan provided that they are free, Muslim, sane \nand adult.  \n \nIt makes a woman lawful for her prior husband, if he is a free \nman. As for the woman divorced by a slave, it makes her lawful \nwhen he has divorced her twice. However making the divorced \nwoman who has been trebly divorced lawful for her prior husband \nmust involve full penetration. Thus full penetration is not a \nprecondition for requiring ghusl, the hadd punishment and \npayment of the dowry, but full penetration and lack of barrier are \npreconditions for making the couple muhsan and making the \ndivorced woman lawful.  \n \n2.4.c Invalidation of hajj and fasting  \n \nIt invalidates hajj and fasting.  \n \nIt absolutely invalidates hajj, be it obligatory or voluntary, \nintentional or by forgetfulness, when it occurs before standing at \n'Arafa or after it before the Tawaf al-Ifada and stoning the Jamra \nal-Aqaba on the Day of Sacrifice. He continues with his hajj and \nmakes it up the following year. It invalidates fasting, even without \nfull penetration, be it obligatory or voluntary, intentional or by \nforgetfulness. He must make it up and owes kaffarah for the \nobligatory if it is done deliberately. Otherwise there is only \nmaking up, as is the case with doing it deliberately in a voluntary \nfast.  \n \n2.5 Ghusl and menstruation  \n \n2.5a When ghusl is done after menstruation  \n \nA woman does ghusl immediately when she sees the white \nliquid [qassa] which comes at the end of menstruation, or \nwhen she notices dryness, even if she notices this after a \nday or two days or only an hour.  \n \nAs the blood of menstruation is mentioned as one of the causes \nwhich oblige ghusl, he goes on to clarify the sign which indicates \nthat it has ended and that the womb is free of it. He mentioned \nthat it has two signs: a white liquid and dryness. When the \nmenstruating woman sees one of the two signs, then her purity is \nclear and she is adjudged to be pure from that moment and does \nnot wait for the second sign. There is no minimum length of \nmenstruation. Its minimum amount is one spurt. There is no \nmaximum amount of it, but has a maximum in time, which is \nfifteen days.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): Its maximum for someone \nwho is having a first period is half a month [i.e. 15 days. If it stops \nbefore that and then she remains pure for half a month and then \nblood comes, it is a new menstruation.] as half a month is the \nminimum of purity [which is fifteen days and there is no limit to \nits maximum].  \n \nAnd the maximum length of menstruation for someone with \nnormal periods [even if she has only had one period] is fifteen \ndays. There are three days of using precaution [i.e. above and \nbeyond] her normal maximum. [i.e. if she normally menstruates \nfive days and then menstruates after that and it does not stop \nafter the full five days, she adds three days to it. If it does not stop \nafter that, it is false menstruation. But if her normal period is 15 \ndays, she does not use precaution at all.] This is as long as it does \nnot exceed half a month. [If it is 14, she uses one, and if 13, she \nuses 2.] Then she is pure [to fast, pray and have intercourse even \nif the blood is flowing, because it is false menstruation and not \nmenstruation.]  \n \n2.5b Resumed Bleeding  \n \nIf bleeding starts again or if she sees any yellowish \ndischarge, she must stop doing the prayer and then when \nthe bleeding stops again she should do ghusl and start the \nprayer once more.  \n \nIf she sees the sign of purity and the judgment is that she is pure \nimmediately, from the moment she sees purity, and then the blood \nresumes again or there is a yellowish discharge which does not \nhave the color of blood, she stops praying and reckons that she is \nstill menstruating that day and considers all of it to be the same \nperiod. It is one period since it has come before complete purity. \nOr it may stop before the end of her normal period or extend after \nits normal length and before looking for purity or before it was \ncomplete. When the bleeding comes after complete purity or when \nit ended after her normal period and the days of looking for the \nend, then it is not menstruation, but abnormal bleeding, When it \nstops again, then she again does a ghusl and prays, and does not \nwait to see whether more blood comes again. This question \ninvolves the woman whose purity is interspersed with bleeding to \nadd the days together.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): The one who has bleeding \npatches has a ghusl whenever the blood stops in the patched days \nunless she thinks that the blood will return before the time she is \nin finishes. In such a case she is not commanded to do ghusl. She \nfasts (if it stops at Fajr or before) and prays and has intercourse \nafter ghusl according to the known position as opposed to the \nauthor of the Irshad who says that intercourse is not permitted. \nShe can pray in all the days of menstruation when the period \ncomes to her at night and then stops before Fajr. So she might not \nmiss a prayer or a fast.  \n \n2.5c Legal Consideration of Such Gaps  \n \nWhen this situation occurs, it is considered as one \nmenstrual period when reckoning the period of ‘Idda (after \ndivorce or being widowed) or the period of istibra [after \nthe death of a husband].  \n \nThe intermittent blood is considered as the same period of \nbleeding in respect of „Idda and istibra' and so the days of blood \nare added together until they reach that at which its judgment \nnormally ends or other than. If it exceeds that it is abnormal \nbleeding.  \n \n2.5d Consideration of a Long gap  \n \nIf there is a considerable interval between the two periods \nof bleeding, such as eight or ten days, then the second one \nis considered a new menstrual period.  \n \nIf there is not a long gap between the two periods of bleeding, it is \nconsidered as one menstrual period for the purposes of „Idda and \nistibra', but if there is a long interval between them but less than \nthe time of purity, which is eight or ten, even though the accepted \ninterval is 15 days, then the second is a new menstruation, i.e. the \nbeginning of a new one which is counted for purposes of „Idda and \nistibra'.  \n \n2.5e Abnormal Bleeding  \n \nIf menstrual bleeding continues longer than fifteen days, it \nis considered as istihada and the woman should perform a \nghusl, fast, pray and her husband can have sexual \nintercourse with her.  \n \nThis means if the bleeding continues for her, then she waits for \nfifteen days from its beginning because the maximum of \nmenstruation in respect of her is fifteen days. Then she is judged \nto have abnormal bleeding whether the two periods of bleeding are \ndistinct or not. She has a ghusl and prays and fasts. Her husband \ncan come to her. We mention that which has a beginning to \ndistinguish it from that which has no beginning because there are \ncertain points regarding that because it is either what is normal \nfor her varies or it does not. If it is not different and the blood \ncontinues more for her than it normally does, she looks for purity \nfor three days as long as they do not exceed fifteen days. If it \nvaries, she then looks for purity when it is longer than its norm.  \n \n2.6 Lochia  \n \n2.6a Minimum of Lochia  \n \nIf the bleeding after childbirth [nifas] stops soon after the \nbirth, a woman should do ghusl straightway and start \ndoing the prayer.  \n \nIf shortly after childbirth a woman sees the sign which indicates \nthat it is ended with white discharge and dryness, then she \nwashes and prays. \"Soon after birth\" has no minimum limit in \nrelation to time and it has a minimum in relation to what \nemerges, which is one gush.  \n \n2.6b Maximum of Lochia  \n \nHowever, if bleeding continues longer than sixty days, \nthen she does ghusl anyway, the bleeding is considered as \nistihada, and she does the prayer and fasts and her \nhusband can have sexual intercourse with her.  \n \nIf the bleeding continues, she waits for sixty days, which it the \nmaximum of its extent. If it stops after sixty, the matter is clear. If \nshe continues to bleed after sixty, it is abnormal bleeding and she \nhas a ghusl, prays and fasts and her husband can come to her. \n \n \n \nChapter Three: On the Purity of Water, \nClothing and the Place of Prayer and What \nCan Be Worn When Doing the Prayer \n \n \n \nThis chapter clarifies the condition of purity of water, the \nprecondition of purity of clothing, the precondition of the purity of \nthe place and what clothes are permitted in the prayer. \n  \n3.1 Purity of Water \n  \n3.1a Obligation of purity  \n \nWhen you do the prayer you are talking to your Lord. You \nmust therefore prepare yourself for this by doing wudu' or \nghusl if a ghusl is necessary.  \n \nPurity in the Shari‟ah is a legal state which becomes obligatory in \norder to make the prayer permissible. The one who prays speaks \nintimately with his Lord. According to the hadith which Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) relates in the Muwatta, he must \nprepare for the prayer. The text of the Muwatta' is that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) came out to his Companions while \nthey were praying and their voices were raised in the recitation. \nHe said, \"When you pray, you are speaking confidentially to your \nLord. So look to what you confide to Him, and do not say the Holy \nQur'an out loud so that others hear it.\" He must prepare for that \nconversation by having an attentive heart and humility, and must \nstand with respect before Him, seeking His protection. When he \nlacks that, he does not speak to Him and the term \"conversation\" \nis not valid for him. Nonetheless, it is true that he prays and must \nadopt the means for that by being pure of minor and major \nimpurities.  \n \n3.1b Pure Unchanged Water  \n \nThis \nmust \nbe \ndone \nusing \npure \nwater \nwhich \nis \nuncontaminated by any impurity.  \n \nPurification from impurities is achieved by pure water, i.e. that \nwhich is not mixed with what changes any of its three qualities: \ncolor, taste or smell, whether that change in its attributes is due \nto something either pure or impure. Thus if it is changed by rose \nwater, it is not valid to use it for things like wudu' and ghusl.  \n \n3.1c Change in Color of Water by contact with earth  \n \nYou cannot use water whose color has been changed by \nsomething mixed in with it whether that thing is pure or \nimpure unless the change of color has been caused by \nsomething in the earth where the water is from such as \nsalt deposits or mud or similar things.  \n \nIt is a precondition that the water used for things like wudu' and \nghusl has not been changed in its attributes by what is usually \nseparate from it, except for earth with which it is in direct contact \nand to which it clings as when it lies in salty earth, sulfurous \nearth or fetid mud.  \n \n3.1d Rain Water  \n \nAny water coming from the sky or from springs or wells or \nthe sea is all good, pure and purifies impurities.  \n \nThese waters which originate from the sky are all pure in \nthemselves and good for any use whatsoever, whether drinking or \nsuch things or acts of worship, like wudu', ghusl and removing \nimpurities as long as the water remains in its original state and is \nunchanged any anything which is normally separate from it.  \n \n3.1e Change in Color of Water  \n \nIf the color of the water has been changed by something \npure which has got into it, it remains pure but cannot be \nused for purification either in wudu' or ghusl or for \nremoving impurities.  \n \nMeaning that water whose color has been changed with something \npure, like water from pasta, is pure in itself but does not purify \nsomething else, and so it is not used for wudu' or other things like \nghusl.  \n \n3.1f Change of Water through Impurity  \n \nWater that has been changed by something impure getting \ninto it is not pure and cannot be used for purification \npurposes.  \n \nWater which has been changed through impurity, whether in \ncolor, taste or smell, and whether the water is little or a lot, it has \nsubstance or not, is no longer pure or purifying. It is not used \neither for normal things or for acts of worship.  \n \n3.1g A Small Amount of Impurity  \n \nA small amount of impurity makes a small amount of water \nimpure even if there is no change in the water.  \n \nIf an impurity falls into small amount of water, like the water \nprepared for wudu' or ghusl, even if it is something small and the \nimpurity does not change it, it is not permitted to use it. The most \nfamous position is that is pure, but it is disliked to use it when \nother water exists, provided that it has not been altered. If it has \nbeen changed, its purity absolutely no longer exists.   \n \nShaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that if there is a \nlot of water and it is not changed, then it remains pure. There is \nno specific definition of \"a lot\" in the Maliki School.  \n \n3.2 Amount of Water Used  \n \n3.2a Using a Small Amount of Water  \n \nIt is Sunnah to use a small amount of water when washing \nprovided you do it thoroughly. Using an excessive amount \nis extremism and innovation.  \n \nA small amount of water should be used as long as washing is \ndone properly. Pouring while rubbing is recommended, i.e. a \ndesirable aspect in the din. Using a lot of it, pouring it while using \nit is excess, i.e. increase in the din and innovation, i.e. something \ninnovated which is contrary to the Sunnah and the path of the \nSalaf. \n  \n3.2b The amount used by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam)  did wudu' with one \nmudd of water which is equivalent to [1 1/3 ratls] and he \ndid ghusl with one sa'a which is four mudds measuring by \nhis mudd. \n \nHe points out that it is established in the Sunnah that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did wudu' using a mudd, which is \n1 1/3 ratls and he did ghusl with a sa' which is four mudds. So \naltogether it is 5 1/3 ratls. His aim is to inform us of the excellence \nof economy and abandoning profligacy and the amount which was \nenough for the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n3.3 Purity of the Place and Clothing  \n \n3.3a Purity of Place  \n \nIt is obligatory for the place where you are going to do the \nprayer to be pure.  \n \nThe purity of the place where the limbs of the one praying will \ntouch is obligatory for the sake of the prayer, i.e. its purity for the \nsake of the prayer. Purity for other things, like dhikr is \nrecommended.  \n \n3.3b Purity of Clothing  \n \nYour clothing must also be pure. It is said by some that the \nnature of the obligation referred to here is that of an \nabsolute obligation [fard] and by others that it has the \nobligation of a confirmed Sunnah [Sunnah mu’akkada].  \n \nThe purity of the garment of the one praying is obligatory \nprovided it is remembered and he has the ability to achieve that. \nIf someone intentionally prays in an impure garment when he is \nable to remove it, he must always repeat that prayer. If he prays \nin such a state out of forgetfulness or is unable is remove it, he \nrepeats it if it is still within the time of the prayer. The time of \nDhuhr extends until the yellowing of the sky, and Maghrib \nand 'Isha' extend through the entire night. It is said that it is \nSunnah to remove the impurity, and both positions are known and \nacceptable. Based on the position that it is Sunnah, it is repeated \nat the time absolutely, whether that was intentional, or he was \nable to remove it, or out of forgetfulness or ignorance.  \n \n3.3c Places where it is forbidden to pray:  \n \nYou should not do the prayer in the following places:  \n \n3.3c1 Camel places  \n \nin places where camels congregate,  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in places where camels are kept when they \ncome from water, even if it is safe from impurity and even if \nsomething pure is spread out and is prayed on it because the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did not say that the reason was \nimpurity so that it would be negated if it was negated.  \n \n3.3c2 The Middle of the Road  \n \nor in the middle of the road,  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in the middle of the road where you are \nunsure whether the odor of animals and urine will get on you. If \nyou do pray there, it is recommended that you repeat it within the \ntime. When someone prays there because the masjid is too \ncrowded or he spreads something pure and prays on it or he is \ncertain that it is pure, then there is no dislike.  \n \n3.3c3 On top of the Ka'ba  \n \nor on top of the Ka'ba,  \n \nIt is prohibited to pray on top on the Ka'ba, based on the fact that \nit is necessary to face its building. The one who is above it cannot \nface the building. So if he prays an obligatory prayer on top of it, \nhe must always repeat it because what is important is to face it.  \n \n3.3c4 Public Baths  \n \nor in public baths, a place which you are not certain \nwhether it is pure or not.  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in the baths. The reason for the dislike is the \nlikelihood of impurity. If he is certain of its purity, then the dislike \nis negated and the prayer is permitted.  \n \n3.3c5 Rubbish Dumps  \n \nor on a rubbish heap  \n \nIt is disliked to pray at a place where rubbish is thrown since one \nis not safe from impurity. If he is safe from impurity, then it is not \ndisliked.  \n \n3.3c6 Slaughterhouses \n  \nor in a slaughter house,  \n \nIt is disliked to pray in a place where animals are slaughtered if \nhe is not safe from impurity. Otherwise, it is not disliked.  \n \n3.3c7 Graveyards  \n \nor in the graveyards  \n \nWhen the graveyard is a Muslim one, and there are no disinterred \nparts of the dead in the place of prayer, then it is permitted to \npray there. If there are any parts of those buried in the place of \nprayer, then the judgment of the prayer there depends on the \ndisagreement about and whether the human being becomes \nimpure by death or not. If the dead person is not impure, and the \nperson prays there deliberately, then it is disliked to pray there \nsince there is uncertainty or certainty that there are parts of the \ndead person which would involve humiliation or walking on the \ngrave. As for the prayer, it is not disliked in itself.  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked praying in the \ngraveyards of the unbelievers because they are pits of the Fire, \nbut if someone prays in them and is safe from impurity, his prayer \nis not invalid, even if he is not actually safe from praying on \nimpurity.  \n \n3.3c8 Non-Muslim places of worship  \n \nand places of worship of non-Muslims.  \n \nThis designates churches, synagogues and fire temples of the \nMagians. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked praying in \nthem because of impurity from their feet, i.e. that is the custom in \nthem. The dislike is inasmuch as he prays in it by choice, not \nwhen is compelled to that. Otherwise there is no dislike. There is \nno difference between the ruined or inhabited place.  \n \n3.3d Minimum Clothing in the Prayer for a man  \n \nThe least clothing a man can do the prayer in is something \nwhich covers his 'awra (everything between his navel and \nhis knees) such as a long shirt or a piece of cloth he can \nwrap round him.  \n \nThis minimum of what does not involve sin and is adequate for \nwhat is desired of the one who prays is a garment is that which \ncovers the private parts, be it a long shirt, cloak or trousers. A \nprecondition for the cloak is that it is thick and not thin or \ntransparent, i.e. the private parts should not be outlined or \nencompassed. If it is like that, it is disliked as long as the \ndefinition is not due to wind. Otherwise not. If it is transparent, \nthen sometimes the private parts might appear through it without \nthinking about and then the prayer would be invalid. Sometimes \nit only appears by thinking about it, and it is judgment is like the \nperson whose is doing something disliked and the prayer is valid.  \n \n3.3e Uncovered shoulders  \n \nHowever, it is disliked to do the prayer wearing something \nthat does not cover the shoulders, but if this does happen \nthe prayer need not be repeated.  \n \nIt is disliked for a man to pray in a garment which leaves his \nshoulders completely uncovered when something else is available. \nIf he prays and his shoulder-blades show when he is able to cover \nthem, he does not have to repeat the prayer either in the time or \nafter it.  \n \n3.4 Women's Dress and Prostration  \n \n3.4a A Woman's minimum dress  \n \nThe least clothing a woman can do the prayer in is a thick \nfull-length garment covering her whole body including the \ntop of the feet and something covering her head.  \n \nThe minimum of adequate clothing for a free adult women in the \nprayer consists of two things: one is a thick or ample full-length \ngarment which does not define the figure nor is transparent. This \nis either hasif, which means thick, or khasif, which a full complete \ncovering which covers the top of the feet. It also means what does \nnot define figure nor is transparent because what he means by the \nminimum is that the prayer is that with which the prayer does not \nhave to repeated in the time or outside of it.  \n \nThe second item is a head-covering which covers her hair and her \nneck. Part of its precondition is that it is thick. In short, the fiqh is \nit is obliged for a woman to cover all her body in the prayer, even \nthe soles of her feet based on the statement of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), \"It is not permitted for a woman to show \nanything in the prayer except her face and palms.\"  \n \n3.4b A woman's prostration  \n \nA woman should touch the ground with the palms of her \nhands in sujud just as a man does.  \n \nThe woman touches the earth with her palms in prostration. It is \nmentioned here because it might be imagined from his words \nabout covering the top and soles of her feet that she covers her \npalms because each of them are part of the person who prays who \nis obliged to cover the entire body. Therefore this idea which is \nmentioned here must be eliminated.  \n \n \n \nChapter Four: On How to do Wudu' and what \nis Fard and Sunnah in it – How to Clean \nYourself after Going to the Lavatory with \nWater [Istinja'] or with Stones and Other \nThings [Istijmar] \n \n \n4.1 Istinja' [Cleansing with water in the lavatory]  \n \nIstinja' is to wash the place of filth with water, derived from naja, \nto rescue, meaning to cut. It is as if the one who does istinja' \nremoves something offensive from himself. Istijmar is to use small \nstones to remove offensive matter on the place.  \n \n4.1a Not part of wudu'  \n \nCleaning yourself with water after going to the lavatory \nshould not be considered a part of wudu', being neither \none of its Sunnah nor its fard aspects.  \n \nIt is neither obligatory, Sunnah or recommended to connect wudu' \nto istinja'. It is a separate form of worship which is distinct from \nwudu' in time and place. It is not considered one of the sunan nor \none of the obligations nor one of the merits of wudu'. Its aim is to \nclean the place in particular. It is recommended that it precede \nwudu'. If he delays it, then he must be careful about touching his \npenis which would break his wudu'.   \n \n4.1b Its Purpose \n  \nHowever, you have to do it in order that all impurities are \nremoved before doing the prayer. You do not have to make \na special intention before doing it.  \n \nIstinja' is to remove impurity and so it is obligatory that it be done \nwith water, as istijmar is done with stones so that he does not \npray with impurity on the body. Part of what indicates that it is \npart of removing impurity is that it is enough that he remove it \nwithout intention.  \n \n4.1c Impurity on Clothes  \n \nThe same thing applies when washing impurities off \nclothes.  \n \nCleaning impurity from clothes does not require an intention.  \n \n4.1d Description of Istinja'  \n \nThe way you wash yourself after going to the lavatory \n(istinja') is first of all to wash your hand and then the end \nof the penis where the urine comes out. You then wipe any \nimpurity from your anus using hard earth or other things \nor your left hand, which you should then wipe on the \nground and wash.  \n \nThe full description of istinja' is that after he has removed \nanything by lightly using his fingers, he takes his penis in his left \nhand with his index finger and thumb and then lightly pulls it \nfrom the bottom to the glans. Then he wipes any impurity from his \nanus with clods or anything which can be used for istijmar. Then \nhe washes his left hand fearing that any unpleasant smell will \nremain on it. Then he does istinja' with water, but he first washes \nthe place of urine before the place of feces so that his hand will not \nbe impure. Combining istijmar and istinja' with water is better \nsince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that.  \n \n4.1e Further Cleaning  \n \nAfter this you wash your anus by pouring water over it \nwhich you continue to do while at the same time relaxing \nit a little, rubbing the area thoroughly with the left hand \nuntil it is clean.  \n \nYou continue to pour water without letting up because it is more \nhelpful in removing filth. You relax the anus a little because there \nare folds in it. When water touches it, it contracts. When it is \nrelaxed, it can be washed. The place is rubbed with the hand while \nthe water is being poured until it is cleaned of noxiousness. It is \nenough that he thinks it probable if he is able to do that. If he is \nnot able to do it because his hand is cut off or short, he delegates \nsomeone who is able to touch that place, be it wife or slavegirl. He \ndoes not do wudu' when he leaves that without washing it.  \n \n4.1f What is unnecessary  \n \nYou do not have to wash the inside of either of the two \nopenings.  \n \nIt is not recommended or Sunnah to wash inside the openings. For \na man, there is only one opening, because the urethra has no \nopening.  \n \n4.1g In case of breaking wind  \n \nYou should not do istinja' on account having broken wind.  \n \nIt is forbidden to do this cleansing on account of wind. The basis \nfor that is the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam),\"The one who does istinja' on account of wind is not one of \nus.\" There is no text which clarifies whether the prohibition is one \nof prohibition or one of dislike. The hadith can imply either.  \n \n4.2 Istijmar [Cleansing with stones]  \n \n4.2a Number of stones  \n \nWhen doing istijmar it is sufficient to use only three stones \nprovided that the last one comes out clean,  \n \nIstijmar is done with three stones. When the last one comes out \nclear of noxiousness, then that is adequate, even if water is \navailable. One might conclude from his words that istijmar using \nless than three stones is not permissible. But the well-known \nposition is that it is based on cleanness, even if it that is achieved \nwith only one stone.  \n \nShaikh ibn Juzayy (rahmatullahi alaihi) points out that it should \nbe an odd number.  \n \n4.2b Water is better  \n \nbut using water is more purifying, pleasanter and \npreferred by the men of knowledge ['ulama'].  \n \nIt is understood from his words that the stones are enough, even if \nwater exists, out of the fear that someone might imagine that that \nis the same as using water and that they are equally excellent. \nThat possibility is eliminated by his words that water is \"more \npurifying\" because neither substance nor trace remains when it is \nused while the stone only removes the actual thing, and water is \nbetter because it removes doubt. It is preferred by scholars, with \nthe exception of Shaikh ibn al-Musayyab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwho said that using water is the action of women and implies that \nit is part of their obligation, i.e. specific to them and they are not \nallowed to use stones, as it is specifically necessary in \nmenstruation, lochia and sperm, i.e. in respect of the one obliged \nto do tayammum because of illness or when he does not have \nenough water for ghusl, but does have enough water to remove the \nimpurity. Water is also specifically necessary when a lot spreads \nout from the orifice when it is more than is customary.  \n \n4.3 Washing the hands before wudu'  \n \nIf someone has neither urinated nor defecated but is doing \nwudu' because he has broken it in some other way or has \nbeen asleep or done something else which makes it \nnecessary for him to do wudu' he should wash his hands \nbefore he puts them into whatever water container he is \nusing.  \n \nIf someone has not urinated nor defecated or anything else which \nwould require istinja', like madhy and Wady, and wants to do \nwudu' because he has broken wind or done something else which \nobliges wudu', like apostasy, uncertainty about impurity, \nbecoming a Rafidite [extreme Shi'ite], and other reasons like sleep, \nintoxication and unconsciousness, in following the Sunnah, he \nmust wash his hands first even if there is nothing on them which \ndemands washing them as when they are both clean. Washing the \nhands must absolutely be done whether he does istinja' or \nanything else.  \n \n4.4 Sunnah’s and obligations of Wudu'  \n \n4.4aWashing the hands to the Wrists  \n \nThe Sunnah’s of wudu' include: washing the hands before \nputting them into the water container,  \n \nOne of the Sunnah‟s of wudu' is to wash the hands to the wrists \nbefore putting them in the vessel. The Sunnah of washing the \nhands before putting them into the vessel is when there is little \nwater and it is possible that it might be used up. Otherwise it is \nnot Sunnah to wash them before putting them in the vessel.  \n \n4.4b Rinsing the mouth  \n \nrinsing the mouth,  \n \nRinsing the mouth is a Sunnah: it is to move water about in the \nmouth and spit it out. If he swallows it, it is not the Sunnah. Also \nif he opens his mouth so the water runs into it, it is not the \nSunnah. The water must be moved about in the mouth and then \nspat out.  \n \n4.4c Sniffing up water  \n \nsniffing up water into the nose and blowing it out again,  \n \nOne of the Sunnah‟s is to put water in the nostril by inhaling and \nif water is put up the nose without sniffing, that is not the \nSunnah. To blow it out, he puts his forefinger and thumb of his \nleft on his nose and blows out the water from the nostrils using his \nbreath.  \n \n4.4d Wiping the ears  \n \nand wiping the ears. These are all Sunnah actions,  \n \nIt is a Sunnah of wudu' to wipe the outside and inside of the ears. \nThe outside is what is next to the head and the inside is what is \nbeside the face.  \n \n4.5 Obligatory Elements of Wudu'  \n \nthe rest being obligatory [fard].  \n \nThe rest of wudu' is obligatory. This sentence is unclear since the \nrest of wudu' includes aspects which are Sunnah, like repeating \nthe wiping of the head, renewing the water for the ears, and the \ncorrect sequence, and that which is recommended, like saying the \nbasmala at the beginning. The answer to that is that his words, \n'the rest being obligatory' means the rest of the limbs which are \nwashed and wiped independently since it is obligatory to wipe the \nhead, and repeating it is dependent on it. The rest of the limbs \ndesignates independent obligations. Renewing the water and the \ncorrect sequence are not limbs. They are not connected to limbs, \nbut to other than limbs because renewal is connected to water and \nproper sequence is connected to washing.  \n \n4.6 How to do wudu'  \n \n4.6a Basmala  \n \nSome of the men of knowledge ['ulama'] say that when you \ngo to do wudu' because you have been asleep or for any \nother reason you should begin by saying \"bismillah\" [in the \nname of Allah], whereas others say that this is not part of \ndoing wudu' correctly.  \n \nWhen you go to do wudu' for some reason which obliges it, like \nsleep or something else, some scholars says that one begins with \nthe basmala. It is said that he says, \"In the name of Allah, the \nMerciful, the Compassionate,\" and it is said that he simply says, \n\"Bismillah.\" Some scholars do not think that beginning with the \nbasmala was part of the known business of the Salaf, and indeed \nthink that it is reprehensible, i.e. disliked.  \n \nIt is evident from the words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwhen he ascribes each position to 'some' that Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did not take any stand regarding the \nbasmala. There are three transmissions from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) about the basmala. One is that it is \nrecommended, and that is what was stated by Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and is well-known because of the words of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"There is no wudu' for \nthe one who does not mention Allah.\" The hadith appears to imply \nthe obligation, and that is what was said by Imam Ahmad \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nShaikh \nIshaq \nibn \nRahawayh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), who was a mujtahid. The second is that it is \nreprehensible, saying, \"Is he slaughtering so that he needs to say \nthe basmala?\" The third is that there is a choice and then the \njudgment is that it is permitted.  \n \n4.6b Where to place the water vessel  \n \nIt is easier to get at the water if the container is on your \nright hand side.  \n \nIt is recommended for the person doing wudu' to put the vessel \nfrom which he does wudu' to his right because it is easier to take \nwater. If the vessel is open, he can scoop from it. If the opening is \nnarrow, it is better to have it on his left because that is easier.  \n \n4.6c Washing the hands three times  \n \nYou begin by washing your hands three times before \nputting them into the water container,  \n \nAfter putting the open vessel to the right and the narrow one to \nthe left, to follow the Sunnah, he begins by washing his hands to \nthe wrists three times before putting them into the vessel with a \nseparate intention.  \n \n4.6d If you have gone to the lavatory  \n \nexcept if you have just urinated or defecated in which case \nyou wash off any traces of impurity before starting to do \nwudu'.  \n \nWhat precedes is about the one who has not urinated or defecated. \nIf he has urinated or defecated, then that person washes off the \nurine or feces from himself before doing wudu'. Then he does \nwudu', meaning the linguistic washing of the hands. Thus his first \nwords about washing the hands before putting them in the vessel \nis about the one who has not urinated or defecated. If he has \nurinated or defecated, then he washes the place of urine or other \nfilth and then does wudu', i.e., washes his hands, which is the first \nof the Sunnah‟s of wudu'.  \n \n4.6f Rinsing the Mouth  \n \nYou put your hand into the container, take some water, \nand rinse your mouth out three times, using either one \nhandful or three as you wish.  \n \nYou put your hand in the vessel if it is possible. Otherwise you \npour the water and take enough water without being extravagant. \nYou can rinse the mouth three times using one handful of water. \nThe first handful is Sunnah and each of the remaining two is \nrecommended. If he wishes, he rinses the mouth three times with \nthree handfuls, and the second form is better than the first form.  \n \n4.6g Rubbing the Teeth  \n \nIt is also good to rub your teeth with your finger.  \n \nIt is recommended to clean the teeth with the finger before doing \nwudu'.  \n \n4.6h Sniffing Water up the Nose  \n \nYou then sniff up water into your nose \n \nFor the correct sequence only, so after he has rinsed the mouth, he \nsniffs water up his nose. Note that he says, \"into the nose\" because \nthere might be sniffing without in going into the nose. Perhaps he \nmentioned that to seek the blessing of the actual words of the \nhadith. Sahih Muslim says, \"He snuffs water up his nose.\"  \n \n4.6i Blowing water out the nose  \n \nand blow it out again three times, holding your nose as you \ndo when you blow it.  \n \nWhat is accepted is that it is Sunnah on its own, and the \ndescription of blowing out is to put the finger and thumb of the left \nhand on the nose and to bring the water with the air of the nose as \nhe does when he blows the nose. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) disliked blowing it like a donkey because of the prohibition \nagainst that in the hadith.  \n \n4.6j Number of Times  \n \nIt is all right if you do this rinsing and sniffing less than \nthree times. It is also all right to do all of this with only one \nhandful of water but three handfuls is preferable.  \n \nLess than three is adequate for rinsing and sniffing. The \nminimum is achieved by one or two times. The evidence for what \nhe mentioned is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nwudu' doing each action once and each action twice. The person \ndoing wudu' can also combine rinsing and sniffing in the same \nhandful. It has two forms. One is that he only moves to sniffing \nafter he finishes rinsing and the second is that he rinses and sniffs \nand then rinses and sniffs and then rinses and sniffs. The first is \nbetter because it is free of any reversal of order in worship.  \n \n4.6k Washing the Face: Wetting the Face  \n \nThen you take water, either with both hands together or \nwith \nthe \nright \nhand \nbringing \nthe \nhands \ntogether \nafterwards, and using both hands pour the water onto the \nface.  \n \nAfter finishing rinsing the mouth and sniffing, then he takes \nwater with both hands if he wishes, or with the right hand and \nthen puts it onto both hands and brings the water to his face. It \nappears that moving the water to the face is a precondition. This \nis according to Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn \nMajishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). The well-known position is that it is not a precondition to \nmove it. What is desired is to bring water to the surface of the face \nhowever that happens, even by a water-spout.  \n \n4.6l Actual Washing of the Face  \n \nThen using both hands you wash the face  \n \nHe applies water to the face without splashing the face with water \nas women and most men do it. He washes it with the hands. This \nmeans that washing connected to moving the water to the washed \nlimb is a precondition of the recommendation in wudu'. He also \ndoes that himself, even if he entrusts someone else to do the wudu' \nwhen that is not necessary. It does not satisfy the requirement \nbecause that is one of the actions of the arrogant. Rubbing is also \nobligatory, and the well-known position is that rubbing is \nobligatory in itself, not simply bringing the water to the face.  \n \n4.6m Area covered: Top of forehead  \n \nfrom the top of the forehead - which is marked by the \nhairline -  \n \nThe Sunnah in washing is to begin to wash the limbs from their \ntop. If he begins from the bottom, it is allowed, but what he has \ndone is disliked. He explains that what is meant by forehead is \nwhat touches the earth in prostration and the right and left sides \nof the brow, which is next to the normal roots of the hair. One does \nnot take into consideration thick hair or baldness. He includes the \nthick hair in washing but not the place of baldness. From 'hairline' \nit is understood that part of the head must be washed to achieve \nthe obligation.  \n \n4.6n End of the chin  \n \nto the end of the chin,  \n \nThe face has both length and width. The beginning of its length is \nthe normal roots of the hair and the end is to the end of the chin, \nwhich is point of the beard, and the hairs on the bottom lip. There \nis no dispute about it being included in the washing. Its width is \nfrom ear to ear.  \n \n4.6o Covering the entire face  \n \ncovering the whole area of the face from the jawbones to \nwhere the ears start, making sure you include the eye \nsockets, any wrinkles on the forehead and the bottom of \nthe nose.  \n \nHe must wash the entire face, rubbing around it, including the \ntemples between the ears and the eyes. The well-known position is \nthat it is included in washing. You run your hand over what is \nhidden inside the sockets and inside the eyes. That must be \nwashed. Also the hand must pass over the wrinkles on the brow, \nwhich is the place of prostration The hand must be passed over \nthe bottom of the nostrils. This refers to the outside out and not \nthe inside. He must wash the outside of his lips if they are not \ncovered while washing the face.  \n \n \n4.6p Doing it three times  \n \nYou wash your face in this way three times taking water to \nit.  \n \nThe face is washed in this manner three times from the beginning \nof the limb to the end and rubbing it.  \n \n4.6q The Beard  \n \nWhen washing your face you rub the beard with both \npalms to make sure that water gets into it since hair has a \nnatural tendency to repel water. You do not have to put \nyour fingers through your beard when doing wudu' \naccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). You merely \nrub your hands over your beard down to the end.  \n \nWhen the beard is thick, when washing the face, rub the hair of \nthe thick beard with the palms in order to make the water enter \nit. If he does not do this, he will not do all of the outside of the hair \nbecause the hair repels water which gets on it unless it is moved \nby the hands. The well-known position from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that one does not have to put your fingers \nthrough the hair of a thick beard when doing wudu'. Indeed the \napparent text of the Mudawwana is that it is disliked in the case \nof a thick beard. As for the sparse beard through which the skin \nshows, he must put his fingers through it when doing wudu'. It is \nobligatory to absolutely to do this to make water penetrate the \nhair of the thin or thick beard in washing. The hands must move \nthe water to the end of the beard.  \n \n4.6r The Second Obligation: the Hands  \n \nYou then wash your right hand and forearm three times, or \ntwice, pouring water over it and rubbing it with the left \nhand, making the fingers of one hand go between the \nfingers of the other. Then you wash the left hand and \nforearm in the same way.  \n \nThen first after finishing washing the face, which is the first \nobligation, he moves on to the second obligation, which is the \nhands. He washes the right hand first because it is recommended \nwithout dispute to begin with the right in things before the left \nsince it is sound that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"When you do wudu' begin with the right.\" It is done three or \ntwo times. There is a choice in the number times the hands are \nwashed, but there is no choice in washing the face and feet. The \nreason for that is that it is established that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) washed his face three times and his hands \ntwice each.  \n \nHe pours water on the right hand and rubs it with the left hand. \nThe rubbing must be connected to pouring the water. He puts the \nfingers of one hand between those of the other hand. He inserts \nthem through the gaps from the top and not the bottom because \notherwise that would entail entwining which is disliked. His \nwords can imply either obligation or recommendation, but the first \nis the well-known position. The basis for that is the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"When you do wudu', put \nwater between your fingers and your toes.\" However, the \ncommand is obligatory for the hands and recommended for the \nfeet. Then he washes the left hand in the same manner.  \n \n4.6s Extent of Washing the Hands and Arms  \n \nWhen washing the arms you go right up to the elbow, \nincluding it in what you wash. It has also been said that \nyou only wash up to the elbows and that it is not necessary \nto include them but it is better to include them in order to \nremain on the safe side.  \n \nWhen doing wudu' you wash up to the elbows and include the \nelbows in the washing. It is possible to include them or not in the \nwashing. The most famous position is that it is obligatory to \ninclude them. He clearly stated that here. This is taking the ayat \n(\"and your hands to the elbows,\") to mean \"with\". Those who say \nthat the washing ends at the elbows take the ayat to actually \nmean \" up to\". The third position is that it is recommended to \ninclude them in the washing to remove the difficulty of definition \nbecause it is difficult to define the end which the washing reaches.  \n \n4.6t The Third Obligation: Wiping the Head  \n \nThen you take water with your right hand, pour it onto the \nleft hand and using both hands you wipe over your head, \nbeginning at the hairline at the front of the head. You \nplace fingertips together with the thumbs at the temples \nthen wipe over your head with both hands as far as the \nhairline at the back of the neck. Then you bring them back \nto the place you started, bringing your thumbs up behind \nyour ears back to the temples. Whatever way you wipe \nyour head is acceptable as long as the whole head is \ncovered but the way mentioned is better. If you were to put \nboth hands into the container, then lift them out wet, and \nwipe over your head with them this is also acceptable.  \n \nAfter finishing the second obligation, he moves to the third \nobligation, and takes the water with the right hand and pours it \nonto the left palm and wipes his entire head with his hands. It is \nrecommended to start at the front of the head or the normal \nhairline whether the hair is thick or he is bald. The fingers are put \ntogether except for the thumbs which are put at each of the \ntemples. Then the head is wiped to the back of the neck, which is \nthe bottom of the skull and then it is brought back to the place \nfrom where you started. It is recommended to bring the thumbs \nbehind the ears and back to the temples which must be wiped \nalong with the rest of the face including the hair. This manner of \nwiping is not obligatory, but the basis is to achieve a \ncomprehensive washing and to completely wipe the head and hair.  \n \nIf he put his hands in the vessel, that is another way of taking \nwater for wiping the head. So if he brings his hands out wet after \nputting them in the water, whether it is in a vessel or not and \nthen wipes his head, that is enough according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) without dislike and it is recommended \naccording to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n4.6u The Ears  \n \nThen you pour water over your index fingers and thumbs \nor if you like you dip them into the water and with them \nyou wipe the outside and inside of both ears.  \n \nAfter wiping the head, then the ears are wiped by taking water in \nthe right hand and pouring it over the index finger and thumb of \nthe left hand and the adjoining part of the left palm and he pours \nit on the same of the right hand. Then he wipes the outside and \ninside of both ears. If he wishes, he can dip the index fingers and \nthumbs in the water and then wipe with them. The first manner \ncomes from Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the \nsecond from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n4.6v Women's Action in Wiping  \n \nWomen wipe their heads and ears in the same way but they \nhave to wipe over any hair that is hanging loose and \ncannot wipe over any head covering.  \n \nThe woman wipes her head and ears like the man in amount and \ndescription by the words of the Almighty, \"Wipe your heads,\" and \nwomen are the sisters of men. She wipes over any hair hanging \nloose. What is well-known is the obligation to wipe over any of \nman's hair which is hanging on the two sides since it will fall on \nthe place of the obligation or on the face. As for that which \nactually extends over the place of the obligation, it is agreed that \nit is obligatory to wipe it.  \n \nThe 'head covering' is a cloth by which a woman binds her hair to \nprotect it from the dust. She also does not wipe over other similar \nhair coverings when they are put next to the head because all of \nthat is a barrier since it does not let her wipe what must be wiped. \nOtherwise it is permitted as Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) wiped over his \nturban, which is by necessity. Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ndisagreed and said that there is choice in that. It is affirmed that \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) wiped the forelock at the \nfront of the head first and finished by wiping over the turban.  \n \nWiping under plaits  \n \nThey should put their hands under their plaits when \nbringing their hands back to the front.  \n \nAfter the woman begins the wiping from the front of her head and \nreaches the back where the hair hangs down, she must put her \nhands under the plaits of hair to complete it, and it is Sunnah to \nbring the hands back if there is any moisture left on them. It is \nclear from his words that she does not have to undo her plaits \nbecause of the difficulty involved. Some people limit that to what \nis tied with a thread or two. When there are a lot of threads, it \nmust be undone.  \n \n4.6w Fourth Obligation: the Feet  \n \nAfter he finishes wiping the ears, he begins the fourth obligation, \ni.e. washing the feet. It is said that its obligation is wiping. The \nreason for the disagreement has to do with how the words of the \nAlmighty are read and whether \"your feet\" is in the genitive or \naccusative. If it is accusative, then the feet are added to \"face and \nhands\" and there is no doubt that its obligation is washing, and so \nthis judgment is given by the conjunction. If it is genitive, then it \nis joined to \"head\" and it has the judgment of what it is joined to, \nwhich is wiping, and so they are wiped. They are wiped if he is \nwearing leather socks. This is deduced from what the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did since it is confirmed that he \nonly wiped his feet when he was wearing leather socks. The \nmultiple transmissions from him (alaihi salat wa salam) is that he \nalways washed them when he was not wearing leather socks.  \n \n4.6x The Manner of Washing the Feet  \n \nYou then wash both feet pouring water onto your right foot \nwith your right hand and rubbing it with your left hand \nlittle by little. You do this thoroughly three times.  \n \nThe description of washing the feet is that water is poured with \nthe right hand onto the right foot which is rubbed with the left \nhand. Rubbing one foot with the other is not enough. This is the \nposition of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nIts washing is recommended to be completed by water and \nrubbing three times and should not be more than that. The \nwashing of the feet is limited to three times, which is one of two \nwell-known positions about whether the fourth is disliked or \nforbidden. The other statement is that washing the feet has no \nlimitation. What is desired is to cleanse, even that is more than \nthree. It is also well-known.  \n \n4.6y The Toes and Heels  \n \nIf you want you can put your fingers between your toes. If \nyou do not do this it does not matter, but doing it makes \nyou feel more satisfied. You then rub your heels and ankles \nand any part which water does not get to easily due to \nhardening or cracking of the skin. You should make sure \nyou do this well, pouring water on the area with your hand \nbecause there is a hadith which says, \"Woe to the heels \nfrom the Fire.\" The \"heel\" of a thing is its extremity or end. \nYou then do the same thing with the left foot.  \n \nIf he wishes, he puts water between his toes while washing them, \nand if he wishes, he leaves that, but it is better to put them \nbetween the toes and no doubt remains when it is done.  \n \nRubbing \nthe \nheels \ncan \nmean \neither \nthe \nobligation \nor \nrecommendation. What is meant is the first. He must rub all those \nplaces where the water does not immediately reach due to \nhardness or cracks as well as wrinkles in loose skin. The threat \nregarding \"Woe to the heels from the Fire\" does not only apply to \nheels, but to every part of the limbs of wudu'. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said that about when he saw that the heels \nhad no water on them and had not been wiped with water. The \nwhole process is repeated with the left foot. He (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did not state the limit of washing, and it extends to the \nankles. The best known position is to include them in the washing.  \n \n4.6z Three Times  \n \nWashing each of the limbs three times is not an actual \ncommand. You can do it less but three is the most you \nshould do. If you can do it thoroughly with less than that it \nis acceptable as long as you do not leave anything out. Not \neveryone is the same in the amount of water they require \nto do wudu' thoroughly.  \n \nThere is no actual definition that it is not adequate if the limbs \nare not washed in wudu' three times each. Three is the limit of \nwhat can be done, and no more than three. Shaikh ibn Bashir \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) transmits the consensus that the fourth time \nis forbidden. The story of the consensus of its prohibition is not \nestablished because of the existence of the statement that it is \ndisliked. However prohibition can include what is disliked. The \nbasis in this is that it is related that a bedouin asked the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) about wudu' and he showed him \nthree times each. It is clear that he did wudu' in his presence and \nthen said, \"This is how wudu' is.\" Therefore anyone who does more \nthan this has acted badly, transgressed and done wrong. If it is \ndone thoroughly with less than that, it is allowed. The maximum \nis specified, but not the minimum since it is contained in one and \ntwo and so its state is known and there is no need to define it.  \n \nNot all people are the same in doing that washing thoroughly. If \nsomeone does not do it thoroughly with one time, then it is not \nallowed and specified in respect of him that which will achieve it. \nIf that is only complete with two, then he intends the obligation by \nthem, and the third is excellence. If it is only thorough with three, \nthen the obligation is intended by it and the recommendation \nremoves what is more. It is clear that the description of wudu' \ncontains obligations, Sunnah‟s and virtues and the person is \nencouraged to perform them in the manner by which none of them \nis lacking.  \n \n4.7 The reward for performing wudu'  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), said, \"Anyone who \ndoes wudu' and does it well and then raises his eyes to the \nsky and says, 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah \nalone, without any partner and I bear witness that \nMuhammad is His slave and Messenger,' will have the eight \ngates of the Garden opened for him and he can enter by \nany of them he chooses.\"  \n \n47a What to say afterwards  \n \nSome of the 'ulama' recommend saying when you finish \nwudu', \"O Allah, make me one of those who turn back to \nYou and make me one of those who purify themselves.\"  \n \nALLAHUMMA IJA'ALNI MINA'T-TAWWABIN WA'JA'ALNI \nMINA'L-MUTATAHHIRIN  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is \nrecommended to say this. The 'tawwabin' are those who have \ncommitted wrong actions and then repented and purified \nthemselves of the wrong actions.  \n \n4.8 Purpose of Wudu'  \n \n4.8a Aim  \n \nYou must do wudu' realizing that you are doing it for Allah \nazza wa jall as He has ordered you to do, hoping that it will \nbe accepted and that you will get the reward for it and that \nit will purify you of your wrong actions.  \n \nScholars say that the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not speak \nabout the intention (niyya) for wudu' because he did not say that \nhe makes the intention to perform wudu' which is an obligation by \nagreement with Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) because \nhe did not recall any disagreement about its being obligatory for \nwudu'. That is why the agreement is related about its being \nobligatory and in the soundest position with Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Opposite it there is a text on wudu' from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) about it not being obligatory. \nThen they disagree about whether it can be deduced from his \nwords or not. Some say that he does not speak about intention in \nthe Risala at all and some of that say that it is deduced from his \nwords \"he must\", meaning the person doing wudu' must be doing \nwudu' sincerely for Allah azza wa jall, not for showing off or \nreputation. That is because sincerity is commanded in the words \nof the Almighty, \"They were only commanded to worship Allah \nmaking the din sincerely His.\" Sincerity is that a person intend \nthe Worshipped by the act of worship without actual articulation. \nThe focus of the intention is the heart. Part of its precondition is \nthat it accompany the first obligation in wudu', which is washing \nthe face. If it precedes it by a lot, then it is agreed that it is not \npermissible. There are two accepted positions about it preceding \nby a little. The best known is that it is allowed. They agreed that \nif he makes the intention after washing the face, then it is not \nadequate. The basis for the intention is that it accompany it. If it \nhappens that he overlooks it, he is forgiven.  \n \nWhen wudu' is done sincerely with the intention of obeying Allah \nazza wa jall's command and secure in himself that the action is \ndone freely, he should hope that it will be accepted and he will be \npurified of wrong actions based on what is in Muslim where the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When a Muslim (or a \nbeliever) does wudu' and washes his face, then every wrong action \nat which his eye looked leaves from his face with the water - or \nwith the last drop of water.\"  \n \n4.8b Wudu' as preparation  \n \nYou should feel in yourself that it is a preparation and a \ncleansing for speaking to your Lord and standing in front \nof Him to carry out the acts He has made obligatory on you \nwith humility in your bowing and prostration.  \n \nHe should know that wudu' is a preparation and a cleansing from \nwrong actions and dirt. When the legally responsible person wants \nto perform wudu', he does it sincerely for Allah azza wa jall \ndesiring that Allah azza wa jall will accept it because he is \npurifying himself and this is in order to prepare to converse with \nhis Lord. Conversing with the Lord demands sincerity of heart \nand devotion of inner consciousness to His remembrance. It is also \nin order to perform the obligation Allah azza wa jall has imposed \non him. Bowing and prostration are specifically mentioned as well \nas humility in other actions because total humility is meant and \nbecause the closest a slave is to his Lord is when he is in \nprostration.  \n \n4.8c Having Certainty  \n \nYou should do wudu' with a certainty of this, taking good \ncare to do it properly for no action is complete without the \nright intention behind it.  \n \nYou should be aware that wudu' is preparation for intimate \nconversation with your Lord in order to make reverence and \nesteem firm in your heart. That will result in doing wudu' with \ndue humility to your Master. This reverence and esteem will \nresult in doing wudu' in a manner which is mindful of avoiding \nimperfections and whisperings. Actions are only according to \nintentions. It is enough that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Every man has what he intends.\"  \n \n \n \nChapter Five: Ghusl \n \n \nEvidence for it and its preconditions were already mentioned in \nthe chapter on wudu'. The description of ghusl contains \nobligations, Sunnah‟s and meritorious elements. The author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did not clarify which are the obligations and \nso we will make that clear. There are five obligations:  \n \nCovering the entire body with water;  \n \nthe intention;  \n \nlack of interruption;  \n \nrubbing;  \n \nand making water penetrate the hair, whether it is thick or there \nare thick plaits.  \n \nThere are five Sunnah‟s of ghusl:  \n \nwashing the hands to the wrists first:  \n \nrinsing the mouth;  \n \nsniffing water up the nose;  \n \nblowing water out the nose;  \n \nand wiping the ear holes. He wipes whatever he can wash of them. \nThe description of the washing is to take water in the hands and \ntilting his head so the water can reach the inside of his ears. He \ndoes not pour water into his ears because that would entail harm.  \n \nIts meritorious parts are seven:  \n \nthe basmala;  \n \nbeginning by removing filth from the body;  \n \nwashing all the limbs of wudu' before the bath;  \n \nbeginning with the upper body before the lower;  \n \nbeginning with the right side before the left;  \n \ndoing the head three times; \n \nand using a small amount of water while doing ghusl completely.  \n \nThere are five disliked things:  \n \nreversing the order of the actions;  \n \npouring a lot of water;  \n \nrepeating the washing after having done it fully;  \n \ndoing ghusl in the lavatory or in a filthy place;  \n \nand to purify oneself while showing the private parts.  \n \nGhusl is washing which covers the entire surface of the body \naccompanied with rubbing because the reality of ghusl consists of \nboth.  \n \n5.1 Things which make ghusl obligatory  \n \n5.1a Janaba  \n \nYou must do ghusl because of janaba  \n \nJanaba results from two things: ejaculation and the disappearance \nof the end of the penis in the vagina. \n  \n5.1b End of menstruation or lochia  \n \nor at the end of menstruation and the bleeding after \nchildbirth.  \n \nAt the cessation of the bleeding of both states, in both attribute \nand judgment. Some of them say that it is attribute rather than \njudgment which was already discussed. You are aware of the \nsimilarity in the attribute, but not in the judgment. The attribute \nis not specific to the obligation.  \n \n5.2 Ghusl with or without wudu'  \n \n5.2a Ghusl without wudu'  \n \nIf, when doing ghusl, you do not include wudu' it is \nacceptable  \n \nIf the person who is purifying himself or herself from janaba, \nmenstruation and lochia confines himself to ghusl without wudu', \nthe ghusl satisfies wudu' and so he can pray with that ghusl \nwithout doing wudu' if he has not touched his penis since the \nminor impurity is included in the major impurity. This is when \nghusl is obligatory, like the ghusl for janaba. As for the ghusl \nwhich is Sunnah or recommended, it does not satisfy wudu'.  \n \n5.2bWhat to do first  \n \nbut it is better to do wudu', having begun by washing off \nany impurity from the private parts or the rest of the body.  \n \nIt is better for the one who is purifying himself from janaba and \nthe like to perform two meritorious actions, one of which is to \nbegin by washing the private parts or any filth on his body. If he \nwashes it with the intention of janaba and removes the filth, that \nis enough for him in the well-known position. He does not have to \nrepeat his ghusl a second time. If he washes with the intention of \nremoving the impurity and then does not wash it afterwards, it is \nnot enough by agreement. The second meritorious action is wudu' \nbefore washing his body to honor the limbs of wudu'.  \n \n5.2c Doing Wudu' First  \n \nAfter this you do wudu' as you would for the prayer.  \n \nBased on his previous statement that it is better for him to do \nwudu', which linguistically is washing the hands to the wrists. So \nhe completes the wudu' which he would do for the prayer. This \nwould necessitate that he washes off any filth on the body or \nprivate parts before washing his hands. That is not the case since \nwashing the hands is put first. So it is better to say that he speaks \nfirst about the judgment, and secondly about the actual \ndescription.  \n \nAnother matter remains. It is whether he repeats washing the \nhands a second time after washing his penis without the intention \nof janaba or not. The hadith of Maymuna (radhi’Allahu anha)  \ndemands that after the filth is removed, the hands are not washed \nagain. That is the definite position of some people, but most of the \ncommentators of Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) say that he \nwashes them again.  \n \n5.2d The question of the feet  \n \nIf you want to, you can include your feet, or if you want, \nyou can leave them to the end.  \n \nHis words show that he can choose between washing his feet \nbefore washing his body or delay that. Some of them therefore say \nthat he can choose between washing his feet before or later. The \nwell-known statement is that he washes his feet before absolutely \nwhether the place where he washing is clean of filth or not. The \nevidence for the accepted position is in the Muwatta' that \n\"whenever the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) performed \nghusl for janaba, he would begin by washing his hands, and then \ndid wudu' as for the prayer. \"So it is clear that he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did a full wudu', which is the school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Shafi‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is the well-\nknown position. It is said that he can absolutely delay washing \nthem whether the place is clean or not. The position about \ndelaying them is more evident than the well-known position based \non what is in the two Sahih collections that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) used to delay washing his feet to the end of \nhis washing and then he would wash them.  \n \n5.3 Description of Wudu'  \n \n5.3a Putting the hands in the vessel  \n \nThen you immerse your hands completely in the water \ncontainer, take them out without holding any water in \nthem, and rub the roots of your hair with your fingertips.  \n \nAfter he has finished wudu', he puts his hands in the vessel if it is \nopen. If it is closed, he pours the water on them. He takes them \nout uncupped without any actual water other than the traces of \nthe water and he rubs the roots of the head, beginning from the \nback of the skull. There are two benefits in rubbing in fiqh: the \nspeed of making water reach the skin, and medicinal, which is \nthat it prepares the head for the water so that it will not be \nharmed when the water is poured on it afterwards since the pores \nof the skin will be closed.  \n \n5.3b Three handfuls of water  \n \nYou then take out three handfuls of water washing your \nhead thoroughly with each one.  \n \nAfter finishing rubbing the roots of head, water is scooped on the \nhead three times while rubbing his head with them. The entire \nhead must be covered with each of the three handfuls and there \nmust not be less than three, even if it is all covered with one and \ndoes his separate parts with it. If three is not enough, he does \nmore until it is covered.  \n \n5.3c Women's hair  \n \nWomen do the same as this. They gather up their hair and \ndo not have to undo their plaits.  \n \nThe woman washes filth off and does wudu' first and wets the \nroots of the hair as a man does. She gathers up and holds her hair \nand it is neither obligatory or recommended in the ghusl for \njanaba or menstruation for her to undo her plaits. The evidence \nfor what he said is in Sahih Muslim where Umm Salama \n(radhi’Allahu anha)  said, \"Rasulullah, I am a woman who \nkeeps her hair closely plaited. Do I have to undo it for ghusl after \nsexual defilement?\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) replied, \"It is \nenough for you to throw three handfuls over your head and then \npour the water over yourself. Then you will be purified.\" It is an \nargument for the one who says that rubbing is not a precondition \nbecause the pouring washes away. As the woman is not obliged to \nundo her plaits, she is not obliged to remove her ring, even if it is \ntight, or her bracelets, nor is it obligatory for a man to remove a \npermissible ring, even if it is tight.  \n \n5.3d Pouring water on right side  \n \nYou then pour water over your right side, then over the \nleft, rubbing the body with both hands immediately the \nwater has been poured so that the whole body is covered.  \n \nAfter washing his head, he begins to wash his body by washing \nthe entire right side beginning from the top and then does the \nsame with the left side. It is obligatory to rub it in the well-known \nposition. From what he says it appears that he does not rub after \npouring water on the right side until water is poured on the left \nside. When water is poured on the left side, he rubs both sides. \nSomething similar is stated in Tahqiq al-Mabani. It is clear that \nhe rubs the right side before pouring on the left side. That is how \nyou find it elsewhere. He rubs with both hands if that is possible. \nIf it is not possible, he delegates someone else to do to do the \nrubbing. The area between the navel and knees can only be \nrubbed by someone who can touch that directly - a wife or \nslavegirl. If he does not find anyone to do that, it is enough to pour \nthe water over his body without rubbing. If he delegates someone \nwhen it is not necessary, that is not allowed in the well-known \nposition. The rubbing should be done after the water has been \npoured, and that is evident.  \n \n5.3e Covering the entire body  \n \nIf you have any doubt about water reaching any part of \nyour body you pour water over it again,  \n \nThe water must cover all the body to discharge the responsibility \nand it is only satisfied when he is certain. If there is any doubt \nabout whether or not the water has reached the limbs of the \nperson performing the bathing, then he is obliged to pour water \nover himself again, and it is not enough to wash it with water still \non his body. \n \n5.3f Rubbing  \n \nrubbing with your hand until you are certain every part of \nyour body has been covered.  \n \nThere must be rubbing or whatever takes its place if that is \nimpossible. It is like that when he is unsure about whether or not \nhe has rubbed a place on his body. He takes water again and rubs \nit until he is certain of that. It is enough that he thinks it \nprobable, differing from those who say that it is not enough. If it is \nenough to make the water reach the skin, which is agreed upon, it \nis better to carry out the rubbing which is disputed. He must \nrepeat until he is sure that his entire body has been covered.  \n \n5.3g Inaccessible areas  \n \nYou must make sure that you include the inside of the \nnavel, under your chin, that you put your fingers right \nthrough your beard, that you rub under your armpits, \nbetween your buttocks and thighs, behind your knees, not \nforgetting the heels and the soles of your feet. You also \nmake sure you rub between each finger.  \n \nThe water and rubbing must include all these areas, the \nneck/throat and that which is under the beard, putting the fingers \nthrough the hair of the beard. The hair of the head is not \nmentioned because it was already dealt with, and other hair must \nbe washed as well, like the eyebrows, eyelashes, mustache, \narmpits and pubic region. Inside the navel must be washed, which \nis a place where dirt gathers, between the buttocks which must be \nrelaxed so that water reaches the folds of the anus, but not inside \nthe anus. Also inside the thighs, which is between the anus and \npenis, behind the knees, and the soles of the feet. It is obligatory \nto put water between the fingers which would have been covered a \nprior wudu'. Otherwise it is done in ghusl. He does not mention \nthings which are far from water, like the lines of the brow and \nhollows of the outside eyelids and under the nostrils and other \nplaces since that was covered in wudu'.  \n \n5.3h The feet  \n \nIf you have delayed washing your feet, you wash them last, \nthereby completing both your ghusl and your wudu'.  \n \nIf they were not washed first, then they are washed, completing \nthe obligatory ghusl and recommended wudu'. If he delayed \nwashing the feet in wudu', he washes them with the intention of \nwudu' and ghusl.   \n \n5.4 Avoiding touching the penis:  \n \n5.4a After the ghusl  \n \nYou should be careful not to touch your penis with the \ninside of your hand when rubbing your body but if you do, \nhaving already completed your ghusl, you have to do \nwudu' again.  \n \nWhen he does wudu' on account of janaba after washing the \nuncleanness from his private parts with the intention of removing \njanaba, he should be careful about touching the penis. It is \nmentioned because it is the most common of several things which \nbreak wudu'. Wudu' is only obliged by touching the penis with the \ninside of the hand. It appears from this that wudu' is not obliged \nfor touching the penis unless it is done with the inside of the hand. \nThat is the position of Imam Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi). The \nschool of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that wudu' \nis obliged for touching the penis with the inside of the hand or the \nfingers. In the Mukhtasar of Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nhe adds \"or by the sides of the fingers\". If you touch the penis \ndeliberately or forgetfully and you have finished wudu', then \nwudu' must be repeated if you want to pray. Otherwise it is not \nnecessary to repeat it until you wish to pray. as is the case with \nother ritual impurities. It is necessary to have an intention to \nrepeat wudu' if he wants to pray, because his major impurity has \nbeen removed and so some say that the intention for wudu' must \nbe renewed which is agreed upon.  \n \n5.4b touching the penis before ghusl is completed  \n \nBut if you touch it at the beginning of your ghusl, after \nhaving washed the areas included in wudu', you should \nthen go over them again with water in the right order and \nwith the intention of doing wudu'.  \n \nAll or part, as is transmitted from Shaikh Abu 'Imran \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). It makes no difference whether he washes \nthem first and then touches or whether he has washed some of \nthem. Following the correct order is recommended. We consider \nthat the correct sequence in wudu' is Sunnah. It is evident that he \nmeans that it is not obligatory in the Sunnah. It is said that it is \nreferring to the obligations of wudu', its Sunnah‟s and its \nmeritorious actions. It is said that it refers to making water flow \non the limbs and rubbing. On this basis and on the basis of what is \nbefore it must mean that it is obligatory.  \n \nThere is disagreement about the renewing the intention of wudu'. \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is obliged to renew \nthe intention of wudu'. If he intends to remove the major impurity, \nthat is not enough. He is in the position of someone doing wudu' \nwho is not in janaba who intends to remove major impurity. \nShaikh al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he is not obliged \nto renew it. The basis of the disagreement is whether each limb \nwhich is purifies first or its own is purified without the full \ncompletion. If we said the first, then it is obliged to renew it \nbecause its purity has gone with the ritual impurity and so it is \nobliged to make an intention to wash it again. If we state the \nsecond, then it is not obliged to renew it because it remains and so \nwe include it in the intention for the greater purity.  \n \n \n \nChapter Six: Tayammum and Its Description \n \n \n \n6.1 When it is done  \n \nIf you cannot find water, then you must do tayyamum, which is \nrecommended. Linguistically tayammum means aiming for \nsomething. The Almighty says, \"Do not have recourse to bad \nthings,\" (2:267) i.e. aim for them. In the Shari‟ah it is a legal act of \nworship by which the prayer becomes allowed. This means that \nthe Shari‟ah has judged it. This exists in wudu' and ghusl. By it \nthe prayer is permitted when wudu' and ghusl are excluded \nbecause tayammum is only to make lawful. Wudu' and ghusl are \ndone in order to remove impurity. It is obligatory by the Holy \nQur‟an, Sunnah and consensus. The Almighty says, \"If you cannot \nfind any water, then do tayammum with pure earth,\" (Holy \nQur‟an 4:43) and in Sahih Muslim the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"We were preferred over people by three things: \nour rows were made like the rows of the angels, the entire earth \nwas made a masjid for us and its earth is purification if we do not \nfind water.\" The consensus is that tayammum is obligatory when \nwater is lacking or the ability to use it lacking it. There are \npreconditions for the obligation: Islam, adulthood, sanity, absence \nof the blood of menstruation or lochia, the arrival of the time, lack \nof water or lack of ability to use it, and that there is no barrier \nover the limbs and nothing which precludes it.  \n \n6.1a On a journey  \n \nIf you are on a journey and you cannot find water, you \nhave to do tayammum, provided that you do not expect to \nfind any water before the time for the prayer has finished.  \n \nThe situation is that either that there is no water to be found at \nall or a judgment that he will not find enough water for wudu' or \nghusl in a journey (or while resident), whether short or not, \nwhether the traveler is healthy or not, and whether the journey is \npermissible or not, because the allowance for doing it on a journey \nor while resident does not have the precondition that the journey \nbe for something permissible. If the allowance is only in the \njourney, like breaking the fast in Ramadan, then the journey must \nbe permissible and it must be a distance of at least four postal \nstages, like that for shortening the prayer.  \n \nThus the mere absence of water is only a reason for the obligation \nof tayammum when he despairs of finding water or he thinks it \nprobable that there is no water. It is not the case if he is unsure or \nhopes for water or is certain of finding water within the time.  \n \nWhat is meant by the obligation is the widest period of obligation. \nThe one who has despaired is someone who has searched for it in a \nmanner which is not arduous for someone like him. He is only \nobliged to seek if he hopes to find it or suspects its presence. If he \nis certain that water does not exist, then he does not look for it in \nthe time. By 'time', the preferred time is meant.  \n \n6.1b Lack of ability  \n \nYou also have to do tayammum even when there is water, \nwhether on a journey or staying in one place, if you are \nunable to touch water on account of illness or are disabled \nby illness to such an extent that although you could use it, \nyou are unable to get to it and cannot find anyone else to \nbring it to you.  \n \nThis is when there is water and you are unable to use it, on a \njourney or at home, because of illness which prevents using it \nsince you fear that using it will cause death, loss of use of a faculty \nor limb, increased illness, delayed recovery, or will actually cause \na illness. If he does not fear any of that, but is only pained by it, he \nmust continue to do wudu' or ghusl. So tayammum is obliged for \nsomeone who is healthy when water exists because he cannot use \nit because illness would occur, or for a sick person who is able to \nuse it, but does not find anyone to bring it to him, even for a \npayment equal to the price which the seller would oblige or it or \nhe does not find a vessel or he only finds a forbidden vessel or \ncannot pay for using it.  \n \n6.1c Danger  \n \nThe same applies to someone traveling who is near water \nbut prevented from reaching it because of the fear of \nthieves or wild animals.  \n \nThis is also true about the traveler who is near water but cannot \nreach it out of fear of thieves as he must preserve his property and \nthe property of others. The property must be more than what he \nwould have to pay to buy water. It must be ascertained that they \nexist or he thinks that it is probable that they exist. Uncertainty is \nnot taken into consideration. The same applies if he fears for \nhimself from wild animals when he is certain about that or thinks \nthat it is probable.  \n \n6.1d Certainty about reaching water  \n \nIf a traveler feels certain that he will get to water within \nthe time of the prayer, he avoids doing tayammum until \nthe end of the time.  \n \nWhether he is in a journey where he shortens the prayer or not \nand he is certain that he will find enough water for wudu' or \nghusl, it is recommended that that he delay tayammum. The \nupshot of the fiqh in the matter is that one of the preconditions of \nthe obligation of tayammum is the arrival of the time. The \njudgment in it varies according to the state of the person doing \ntayammum because either he is certain that water will exist in \nthe time or he will reach it or he despairs of finding it or reaching \nit, or he is unsure about finding it or reaching it in time or hopes \nto find it or reach it in time. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nclarifies these circumstances and indicates it when he says, \"If a \ntraveler feels certain.\" In fact, it is not particular to the traveler, \nbut applies to all who are permitted to do tayammum due to the \nabsence of water. When he is certain that water exists or that he \nwill reach it within the time or thinks that it is probable that it \nexists or that he will reach it in time, then it is recommended to \ndelay tayammum to the end of the time.  \n \n6.1e Certainty about not reaching water  \n \nIf he feels certain he will not get to water he should do \ntayammum at the beginning of the time.  \n \nThis is about the absence of water or the failure to reach it in time \nafter seeking for it. If there is what obliges seeking, then it is \nrecommended that he do tayammum at the beginning of the time \nto obtain the excellence of the time because the excellence of water \nis despaired of. That is how it is judged by the one who thinks it \nprobable that it will not exist within the time or will not be found \nin it.  \n \n6.1f Uncertainty about reaching water  \n \nIf he does not know whether he will get to water or not, he \nshould do tayammum in the middle of the time. This also \napplies to someone who is afraid that he will not be able to \nget to water but nevertheless hopes that he will.  \n \nIf he is unsure about finding it, it is recommended to do it in the \nmiddle of the time. It is affirmed, by Shaikh Ahmad Zarruq \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), that what is meant is uncertainty about \nreaching it. He said that there is no difference between it and \nwhat before it according to the Maliki School. Although it is sound \nfrom the aspect of the judgment, the author's (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) words imply a difference when based on what is meant by \nthe one who hopes. He said that the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) contain something different from the \nposition of the School. That is because his literal words say that \nthe one who hopes does not delay, but does tayammum in the \nmiddle of the time. It is not as he said. His judgment is that of the \none who is certain and the one who is certain delays to the end of \nthe time. Shaikh ibn Harun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I do not \nknow of anyone who transmitted that the one who hopes does \ntayammum in the middle of the time except Shaikh ibn Abi Zayd \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat it is possible that it refutes his words. According to the words \nof Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) by \"fears\" the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) means 'suspects\".  \n \n6.2 Finding Water after doing Tayammum \n \nIf, under any of these circumstances, you do tayammum \nand do the prayer and then come across water within the \ntime of the prayer the following judgments apply.  \n \nThese seven who can do tayammum are: the sick person who \ncannot touch water, the sick person who cannot find anyone to \nbring him water, the traveler who is near water but is prevented \nfrom reaching it by fear of thieves or animals, the traveler who is \ncertain that water will exist within the time, the one who despairs \nof finding it within the time, the one who has no knowledge, and \nthe fearful one who hopes to find it. This is what happens if such a \nperson (except for the sick person who cannot use water then find \nwater or the sick person who can, but does not find anyone to \nbring him the water) finds water. Finding water means having the \nability to use it, its existence, or the existence of a vessel to bring \nit.  \n \n6.2.a A sick person  \n \nA sick person who could not find anybody to bring water to \nhim should do the prayer again.  \n \nIt is recommended that he does the prayer again within the time. \nThe rule for the sick person who does not find anyone to bring him \nwater or any vessel with which to bring the water is to delay \ntayammum to the middle of the time. If he does the necessary \ntayammum in the middle of the time and prays and then before \nthe end of the time of the prayer then that which stops him from \nusing the water is removed, as when he finds what will enable \nhim to obtain it, then it is recommended for him to repeat the \nprayer within the time if he is restricted in that people do not \ncome in to him often. If people come in to him often, then he has \nno restriction, then he does not have to repeat it.  \n \n6.2b A Fearful person  \n \nThis also applies to someone who was afraid of wild \nanimals or other dangers of that sort, and to a traveler who \nwas afraid he would not get to water but hoped that he \nwould. If you have done tayammum for any other reason, \nyou should not repeat the prayer.  \n \nThe one who fears for himself from wild animals or for his \nproperty from thieves is like the sick person who does not find \nanyone to bring him water in the time. It is recommended that he \nrepeat the prayer when he gets water within the time. The result \nis that when the person who is afraid of animals does tayammum \nin the middle if the time, it is recommended that he repeat it in \nthe time with four provisos. That is that he is certain that water \nexists or that he will find it were it not for his fear. His fear must \nbe definite or likely and he ascertains the absence of what he fears \nand the existence of water itself. If he is not certain that it exists \nor that he will reach it, or what he fears is clear, or none of it is \ncertain and someone else finds it, he does not repeat if. If his fear \nis a simple doubt, then he always repeats it.   \n \n6.2c A traveler  \n \nand to a traveler who was afraid he would not get to water \nbut hoped that he would.  \n \nWhen he finds water within the time, it is recommended that he \nrepeat the prayer he has prayed in the time allotted for it, which \nis the middle. Part of the subject is that it is better if it is \nadvanced. What is meant by 'fear' in the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is uncertainty about reaching it. It is \nrecommended for the one who prayed in the time allotted to it to \nrepeat it within the time. That is even more the case if he has \nadvanced it. As for the one who is unsure about whether it exists, \nif he does it before the middle of the time allotted for it, then he \nrepeats it. If he prayed in the middle of the time allotted for it, he \ndoes not have to repeat it. The difference between them is that the \none who is unsure about reaching it, has a sort of falling short and \nso he is asked to repeat it. As for the one who is unsure about \nwhether it exists, he relies on the basis, which is its non-existence.  \n \n6.2d Other reasons  \n \nIf you have done tayammum for any other reason than \nthese three, you should not repeat the prayer.  \n \nIt appears from his words that the one who despairs does not \nrepeat the prayer when he finds water absolutely. It is not like \nthat, and it must be explained. If he finds the water which he \ndespaired of, he repeats it. If he finds other water, he does not \nrepeat it. It also seems from his words that someone who finds \nwater in his bag or saddle or forgets it is there and then \nremembers it, does not have to repeat it. The one who acts \ndeliberately in the three cases has to repeat it, which differs from \nthe literal words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n6.3 Frequency   \n \n6.3a Number of fard prayers with one tayammum  \n \nYou should not pray two fard prayers with one tayammum \nexcept if you are ill and cannot touch water because of \nsome harm to your body which will last at least until the \ntime of the next prayer.  \n \nNone of those seven categories should pray two obligatory or \nSunnah prayers at home or on a journey. whether they share in \nthe time or not, with the same tayyamum except for the person \nwith a constant illness which will continue to the time of the \nsecond prayer. It may happen that he does not do the first prayer \nin its time, either intentionally or by forgetfulness or ignorance. In \nthat case he can pray them both together with one tayammum. \nThis is a general judgment for prayers at home and on a journey.  \n \n6.3b For each prayer  \n \nAlthough there are some who say that even in this \nsituation you should do tayammum again for each prayer.  \n \nFor each obligatory prayer, whether he is healthy or ill, traveling \nor at home.  \n \n6.3c A number of missed prayers  \n \nIt has been related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthat someone who remembers not having done a number of \nprayers can do them with one tayammum.  \n \nThis is a number of fard prayers which he missed by forgetfulness \nor by sleeping through them or deliberately not praying them and \nthen repenting and wanting to make them up: he can pray them \nwith one tayammum, whether healthy or ill, traveling or at home.  \n \nThe first statement is by Shaikh ibn Sha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand the second is by Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand is the famous one. This is why it was rejected by the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) when he was ill at midday when someone \nelse suggested it to him. According to the well-known position, if \nhe disagrees and prays two prayers with one tayammum, whether \nthey are shared or not, he does not ever have to make up the \nsecond.  \n \nAccording to his words at the beginning of the chapter about the \ntime, one does tayammum for the obligatory prayer absolutely, \neven for Jumu'a. That is not the case, since the healthy person \nwho is resident does not do tayammum for Jumu'a since it is a \nsubstitute for Dhuhr. He prays Dhuhr with tayammum, even at \nthe beginning of the time. If he prays Jumu'a with tayammum, \nthat is not acceptable. The sick person and the traveler can do \ntayammum for it. It That is also the case with the funeral prayer. \nThe healthy resident does not do tayammum for it unless it \nbecomes a specific obligation for him since no one else is found \nwho can pray it nor is it possible to delay it until he can obtain \nwater.  \n \n6.3d Voluntary prayers  \n \nAs for the Sunnah‟s and the voluntary prayers, the traveler but \nnot the healthy resident person does tayammum for them, i.e. the \none who is obliged to do tayammum because of lack of water. The \njudgment of the healthy resident for whom tayammum is obliged \nout of fear of illness is like that of the sick person and he does \ntayammum for Jumu'a and the funeral, even if it is not a specific \nobligation, and for the Sunnah and voluntary prayers. If he \nintends an obligatory prayer by his tayammum, he is permitted to \npray the voluntary prayer with it afterwards with the \nprecondition that it is connected to the obligation, even if he did \nnot intend the voluntary prayer after the obligatory. It is limited \nto prayers which are after the obligatory, although if he prays a \nvoluntary prayer before it, it is valid by his statement, 'provided \nthat it is connected to the obligatory.'  \n \nIf there is a long separation or he leaves the masjid, he must \nrepeat his tayammum if he wants to pray the voluntary prayers. A \nshort separation is overlooked. That is defined as about the length \nit takes to recite Ayat al-Kursi. It is also a precondition that he \ndoes not do more than the voluntary. What is \"more\" is defined by \ncustom.  \n \n6.3e What can be used for tayammum  \n \nTayammum is done using pure surface earth, that is any \nsubstance on the earth's surface such as soil, sand, stones, \nor salt deposits.  \n \n\"Pure\" is how the people of firm knowledge and those who know \nfiqh explain \"tayyib\" where Allah azza wa jall says, “do \ntayammum with clean earth,\" Tayyib means pure earth in Arabic \nand that is what Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that sa’id means what is on the \nsurface of the earth in accordance with Arab usage. Others believe \nthat the sa’id in the ayat designates pure earth found on the \nsurface of the earth or brought out from inside of it. This includes \nsalt deposits, and secretions. Tayammum is not done deliberately \non wood, plants and grass and groups. The literal meaning of his \nwords is that tayammum can be done on stones, even hard ones, if \nthere is no soil as long as it has not been baked. It is not permitted \nto do tayammum on lime nor baked bricks, which are red bricks. \nTayammum can be done on soil, whether it has been moved or not, \nalthough it is better when it is not moved by agreement. The first \nis based on the well-known position.  \n \nOne does not do tayammum on other things than earth. Things \nlike salt, alum, sulfur, copper and iron are not used for \ntayammum except in their original place or moved from one place \nto another. But it cannot be in a form which is firm in people's \nhands, like medicines. As for what can be held in people's hands \nlike medicines, it is not valid to use them for tayammum.  \n \n6.4 How to do it  \n \n6.4a Beginning tayammum  \n \nTo do tayammum you hit both hands on the ground - if \nanything clings to them it should be lightly shaken off -  \n \nThis clarifies how tayammum is done. He strikes both hands on \nthe ground. If he is missing a hand, he does tayammum with the \nother. If he is unable to do it, someone does it for him. If he cannot \ndelegate someone, he rubs his face in the dust. What is meant by \n'striking' is not actual striking. What is meant is to place his \nhands on the surface used for tayammum, soil or whatever. This \n'striking' is an obligation. It is not a precondition that anything \nclings to his hands. If something clings to them, he shakes them \nlightly so that some people consider this shaking as one of the \nmeritorious parts of tayammum so that it does not harm his face.  \n \n6.4b The Intention  \n \nBefore beginning, the one doing tayammum must intend earth \nand nothing else with which tayammum is not valid. He must \nintend to make the prayer lawful or intend the obligation of \ntayammum in the first striking. If he is in minor impurity, he \nintends to make the prayer permissible from the lesser impurity. \nIf he is in greater impurity, he intends to make the prayer lawful \nfrom the greater impurity. If he does not call the major impurity \nto mind and thus omits the intention regarding the greater \nimpurity intentionally or by forgetfulness, and prays with that \ntayammum, then he must always repeat the prayer. If he intends \nthe greater impurity, believing that he has it and then the \nopposite is clear, then it allows the lesser. When he intends the \nobligations of tayammum, it is enough for him, even if the \nintention of the greater does not occur to him, If he intends to \nremove the impurity, it is enough for him in the well-known \nposition. Tayammum does not remove lesser impurity. It only \nmakes the prayer permissible.  \n \n6.4c Wiping the face  \n \nthen using both of them you wipe over your whole face.  \n \nAfter shaking his hands, then he wipes his face and does not omit \nany of it. He does not miss the cartilage of the upper ear and other \nthings. If he leaves any of the wiping of all of the face, even a \nlittle, then it is not allowed. He begins from the top, as in wudu' \nand runs his hands over the length of it to his beard. He passes \nover the lines of the face, because the basis of wiping is doing it \nlightly.  \n \n6.4d Striking the ground a second time  \n \nThen you hit both hands on the ground again  \n \nThe second blow is for wiping the hands by way of Sunnah. It is \nnot said how the obligation is done in a Sunnah manner because \nwe say after the obligation that the second comes after the first so \nif he fails to strike the earth the second time and then wipes his \nface and hands with the first, it is adequate.  \n \n6.4e Wiping the hands  \n \nand then wipe your right hand and arm with your left \nhand. To do this you put the fingers of your left hand on \nthe tips of the fingers of your right. Then you slide your \nfingers down the back of your right hand and arm, as far \nas the elbow, folding your fingers round it as you do so. \nthoroughly.  \n \nThe recommended manner of wiping is to first wipe the right with \nthe left, putting the fingers on the right on the left except for the \nthumbs. The palm is passed over the top of the hand and arm to \nthe elbow. It appears from the words of the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the elbow is not wiped because it is the end. It is said \nthat he meant including the elbows as is done with wudu' since \ntayammum replaces it.  \n \nWiping to the elbows is Sunnah, and to the wrists is obligatory \naccording to what is in al-Mukhtasar. Shaikh al-Bisami \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) adds to it by saying that the well-known \nposition of the school is that wiping is to the elbows is obligatory. \nThe dispute is when it is confined to the wrists and he prays. The \nwell-known position is that he repeats the prayer if still within the \ntime. An opposite position is that he must always repeat it. This \nconsequence is rejected. Al-Muqaddamat (Shaikh ibn Rushd) \nprefers that which is followed in al-Mukhtasar, and Qadi 'Iyad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) summarized it in his (Qawa‟id, and it is \npreferred.  \n \nThe well-known position of the school is that the fingers go \nbetween each other, and that is by the flat sides of the fingers, not \nthe sides because they have not touched earth. The well-known \nposition is also that a ring is removed and moving it from its place \ncan be done instead of actually removing it. The difference \nbetween tayammum and wudu' is said to lie in the fact that the \nring is removed in tayammum but not in wudu' because of the \nforce of the water flowing in wudu' which is not the case with \nearth.  \n \n6.4f Wiping the inside of the right hand  \n \nThen you put your palm on the inside of your arm and, \ngripping your arm, slide your hand from your elbow just \nback as far as your wrist  \n \nAfter wiping the outside of the right hand, using the palm, \nbecause the fingers were already used on the outside of the hand \nexcept for the thumb.  \n \n6.4g The thumb  \n \nand then run the inside of the left thumb over the outside \nof your right thumb.  \n \nThis is because it was not wiped before. What he mentioned about \nwiping the thumbs was also mentioned by Shaikh ibn Ata‟Illah' \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) who is the Shaikh of the fuqaha' in his time. \nThe literal of the transmission, which is relied upon, it wiping the \noutside of the right thumb with the outside of the fingers. Shaikh \nal-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I do not know of anyone of \nthe people of language who transmit that the thumb is the largest \n\"finger.” \n \n6.4h The Left hand  \n \nYou then wipe over the left hand and arm in the same way \nand after reaching the wrist you wipe your right palm with \nthe left down to the tips of the fingers.  \n \nAfter finishing the right, then do the left to the wrist. The tips of \nthe fingers designates the inside of the palm and fingers. Observe \nhow he is silent about the left palm unless he says that each of \nthem wipes and is wiped. This is the description which the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned and it was also mentioned by \nShaikh Khalid (rahmatullahi alaihi). He begins with the outside of \nthe right hand with the left and moves to the left before \ncompleting the right. This was transmitted by Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He only moves to \nthe \nleft \nafter \nfinishing \nthe \nright.\" \nShaikh \nAl-Lakhmi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Abdu'l-Haqq (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) preferred that. The position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is preferred. The basis of the preference is \nthat moving to the second before completing the first misses out \nthe excellence of proper order between right and left. Some of the \nShaikhs recommend the transmission of Shaikh Ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) so that he does not wipe the dust on the \npalm, but the one with the reliable position says that the \nremaining of the dust is not sought so that its judgment should be \nobserved.  \n \n6.4i Other methods of wiping  \n \nIf you wipe the right with the left or the left with the right \nin some other way that you find easy, that is acceptable as \nlong as it is done fully.  \n \nIf you differ from the recommended manner, your tayammum is \nstill allowed. It only differs from the best manner. One can deduce \nfrom his words, \"done fully\" that if he does not wipe his forearms, \nit is not allowed because the arms are mentioned in wiping. The \nwell-known position is that if he confines himself to the wrists and \nthen prays, then he repeats it within the time.  \n \n6.5 Judgments about someone in a major state of impurity  \n \n6.5a Tayammum for janaba or end of menstruation  \n \nIf someone is in a state of janaba, or has been \nmenstruating, and cannot find any water to do ghusl with, \nthey should do tayammum and do the prayer and then \nwhen they find water they should do ghusl.  \n \nEven if someone like this finds enough water for wudu', they still \ndo tayammum following the previous information regarding the \npossibility of finding water which is not repeated here. \nTayammum is obliged when there is no water. He mentions it \nhere to refute those who say that someone in a state of janaba and \nor a woman who has been menstruating do not do tayammum.  \n \n6.5b Not repeating prayers done with tayammum  \n \nThey do not have to repeat any prayers they have done.  \n \nBecause their prayer occurs in manner which is commanded. The \nliteral import of his words is that that is the case in the time or \nafter it. It is explained that it is repeated within the time in the \ninstances which were already mentioned. Its literal meaning is \nthat is the case or not whether there is impurity on their bodies. It \nis in the text of the Mudawwana and it is restricted by there not \nbeing any impurity on the body. If there is impurity in his body \nand he prays with it by forgetfulness and they remember after \nthey have finished, then they repeat it within the time. The \nstatement of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) about not repeating \nit is informing about when water is found after they have prayed \nwith tayammum. If there is water before the prayer, and there is \nenough time for ghusl and the prayer, even a rak'at, within the \ntime, then tayyamum is invalid. If they find it after the time has \nbegun and before it finished, even if the time is ample, or the time \nhas begun, but there is not enough time for a ghusl and still \ncatching a rak'at, they pray with tayammum.  \n \n6.6 Further judgments about tayammum  \n \n6.6a Taymmum does not make intercourse permissible  \n \nA man cannot have sexual intercourse with his wife if she \nhas just finished menstruating or the bleeding after \nchildbirth if she has only purified herself by tayammum \nuntil there is enough water for her to do ghusl first and \nboth of them to do ghusl afterwards.  \n \nThis is whether she is a Muslim or a kitabi or a slave girl. \nAccording to the well-known position, it is forbidden for him to \nhave intercourse with her. This does not only imply to actual \nintercourse, but enjoying her between the navel and knee, even \nthrough a barrier, is unlawful. Finding water can either be his \nresponsibility or the responsibility of both.  \n \n6.6b Water for ghusl after intercourse  \n \nThere must be enough water for ghusl on account of bleeding and \nthen for ghusl on account of janaba. This explains the words at the \nend of the book about not approaching a woman bleeding from \nmenstruation or lochia because the literal meaning is that when \nthe bleeding stops, he is permitted to have intercourse, and so \nhere he explains that even if menstruation has stopped, \nintercourse is not permitted, even with tayammum. Intercourse is \nforbidden in the well-known position because tayammum does not \nremove impurity. It only makes the prayer permitted. The words \nof the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) show that tayammum is called \n'purification,' and that is indeed the case since the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Its earth is pure.\" It is also called \nwudu' by since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Tayammum is the wudu' of the Muslim.  \n \n6.6c Avoiding janaba if there is no water  \n \nIt is also deduced from this that if he does not find water, he \nshould not voluntarily bring about a state of janaba in himself. \nThat is the position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-\nMudawwana, i.e. that it is disliked. if he does tayammum for the \nlesser impurity, he should not bring about janaba in himself so \nthat he has to do tayammum for the greater impurity. This does \nnot negate what was already stated about the unlawfulness in the \nstatement of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) about having \nintercourse, because the unlawfulness comes from his going to \nhave intercourse with her when she has purified herself from \nmenstruation by tayammum. This is when he does not fear any \nharm to his body or fear fornication. If he is physically harmed by \nthe length of time or fears fornication, then he has intercourse and \ndoes tayammum.  \n \nOther matters relating to tayammum will be mentioned in \nthe general chapter on the prayer.  \n \n \n \nChapter Seven: on Wiping Over Leather Socks \n \n \nThis chapter is about the judgment regarding wiping over leather \nsocks, the lack of a defined period of time in for doing that, what \ninvalidates it, some of its preconditions, its description and what \nmakes wiping forbidden.  \n \n7.1  Its Judgment  \n \nYou can wipe over leather socks  \n \nIt is an allowance to wipe which is understood from the context or \nfrom wiping because there must be a wiper, man or women.  \n \nIt is permitted to wipe over leather socks. It is a dispensation, but \nwashing is better than it. The permission applies to what is \nunderstood by leather socks. They resemble galoshes, which are \nthick socks with no legs (toes), and they resemble socks which \nhave the form of leather socks, but are made from cotton and \ncovered with leather. The basis for its legality is that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it.  \n \n7.1a Location  \n \neither when traveling or otherwise permitted,  \n \nWiping over socks is an allowance and so it is not particular to the \ntraveler and it is permitted to do at home and on a journey. In the \nwell-known position, it is not a precondition for the wiping that \nthe journey be for something permissible.  \n \n7.1b As long as the socks have not been removed  \n \nprovided you have not taken them off.  \n \nWiping over socks is not limited by a known period of time. It is \nrelated from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that its maximum \nlength when someone is resident is a day and a night, and three \ndays in a journey. This allowance continues, and it is permitted to \nwipe over them without limit within that period until he removes \nthem. If he removes them, it is agreed that it is invalid to wipe \nover them and he should hasten to wash his feet again.  \n \nIf he delays washing them deliberately for as long as it takes the \nlimbs of wudu' to dry, he does wudu'. He is like the one who is \nunable and the one who forgets and builds on his wudu', whether \nit is long or not. If he removes one sock he must remove the other \nas well, and wash both feet. It is not permitted to wipe over one of \nthem while washing the other.  \n \n7.1c Preconditions of Wiping  \n \nWiping has ten preconditions, five of which concern what is wiped \nand five which concern the person who wipes.  \n \nThe preconditions in what is wiped are:  \n \nThat they are made of leather and are not things like cotton socks  \n \nThey are pure and not impure, like the skin of carrion, even if it is \ntanned  \n \nThey are not polluted and pierced except with something like glue;  \n \nThey must cover the place of the obligation (to the ankles) without \nmissing any of it and he must be able to walk in them without \nthem being overly loose-fitting or narrow. Otherwise, it is not \npermitted to wipe over them.  \n \nThe preconditions of the wiper are:  \n \nThat he is not rebelling against Allah azza wa jall by wearing \nthem, and so the man in ihram does not wipe over the socks or act \naffluent by wearing them. This is when the affluent person wears \nthem to avoid the bother of washing the feet or other things which \nhave the sense of indulgent affluence. Such a person is not \npermitted to wipe over them and must always repeat it. If he \nwears them to protect himself from heat or cold or to imitate the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), then he can wipe over them.  \n \nHe must put them on while pure. The one who puts them on does \nnot wipe over impurity, even when they are washed.  \n \nThe one who puts them on in state of purity by tayammum cannot \nwipe.  \n \nHe must fully wash the limbs of wudu' before putting them on.  \n \nHe does not just wash his feet and put them on then finish doing \nwudu', or wash one foot and then put it on before washing the \nother. If he removes them at the beginning and then puts them on \nafter full purity or removes the one he is wearing and then and \nputs it on after washing the second, then he can wipe. The \nmeaning is that the prayer is permitted by it to when he is afraid \nof doing wudu' on account of the cold.  \n \n7.1d When the socks were put on  \n \nThis is if you put them on after you have washed them as \npart of wudu' for doing the prayer. It is in this situation \nthat, if you then break wudu', you are entitled to wipe over \nyour leather socks when doing wudu'.  \n \nThis contains some of the preconditions which permit wiping. His \nwords, \"after you have washed them\" means that they were put on \nwhile in a state of purity which is achieved by water. His words, \n\"for doing the prayer\" means that it is complete in the senses and \nmeaning. So the one who puts on the socks after wudu' and having \nfulfilled all the preconditions is allowed to wipe when he breaks \nwudu' by lesser impurity. It is limited to lesser impurity because \nmajor impurity invalidates wiping because it obliges that they be \nwashed.  \n \n7.1e When it is not permitted  \n \nIn any other case it is not permitted.  \n \nIf it is not like that since he was not pure when he put them or he \nhad purified himself with earth or put them on before his \npurification with water was complete, then it is not permitted.  \n \n7.2  Description  \n \n7.2a  Right Foot and removing impurity  \n \nThe way you do the wiping is to put your right hand on the \ntop of your foot beginning at the toes and your left hand \nunderneath. Then you pass your hands over your foot as \nfar as the ankle.  \n \nThis is the recommended manner of wiping. The ankles are \nincluded in the wiping as in wudu' because that is indicated. It is \ndisliked to follow the creases in it because the basis for wiping is \nlightening. It is disliked to repeat the wiping or to wash it. If he \ndoes that, it is still allowable. It is recommended for him to wipe \nwhen he is going to pray to wash them with the intention of wudu' \nonly or to add the intention of removing mud or impurity, even it \nif is overlooked. If he washes with the intention of removing the \nmud or impurity, or he does not intend anything, it is not enough.  \n \n7.2b  Left foot  \n \nYou do the same thing with the left foot except that you \nput the left hand on top and the right hand underneath.  \n \nThe hands are reversed here. Shaikh ibn Shiblun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the left is like the right according to the literal \nmeaning of the Mudawwana. What is mentioned about wiping on \nthe top and bottom of the leather socks at the same time is agreed \nupon. The disagreement is about the amount which must be \nwiped. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) believes that if he \nconfines himself to wiping the top or bottom of the socks to the \nupper or the lower, it is enough and he does not repeat his prayer. \nShaikh ibn Nafi' (rahmatullahi alaihi) believed that it is not \nadequate.  \n \nBut the well-known position is that it is obligatory to wipe the top \nand recommended to wipe the bottom. If he confines himself to \nwiping the upper and prays, it is recommended that he repeat it in \nthe preferred time. It is recommended that he repeat wudu' and \nthe prayer when he abandons wiping the bottom out of ignorance, \nintentionally or inability if it has been a long time. If it has not \nbeen a long time, he wipes the bottom only. It is like that if he \nonly wipes the bottom out of oversight, if it has been a long time or \nnot. If he omits wiping on the bottom, he always repeats it, \nintentionally or by ignorance or forgetfulness. He builds on the \nintention absolutely if he forgets and if he is unable, if it is not \nlong. Some of the Shaikhs believe that the sides of the feet are \npart of the top.  \n \n7.2c Mud  \n \nIf there is any mud or dung or your leather socks you \ncannot wipe over them until you have wiped or washed it \noff.  \n \nThe dung refers to that of mules, horses and asses. Impure dung \nmust be wiped. It is best to wash off pure mud or dung. Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that that is because \nwiping is done over the socks and this constitutes a barrier over \nthe socks, and so it is obliged to remove it. Shaikh al-Fakihi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) sees it as strong recommendation rather \nthan obligation because if he fails to wipe the bottom of the socks \naltogether, he does not have to repeat it either in the time or \notherwise according to the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). According to the position of Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), he only has to repeat it within the time, not \nany time else.  \n \n7.2d Another form of wiping  \n \nSome people say you should start at the ankles and wipe to \nthe tip of the toes so that any dust on the socks which \nmight get wet does not end up at the ankle end of your \nsocks.  \n \nThis is another description of wiping over the socks, i.e. putting \nthe right on the right and the left on the left, and beginning at the \nankles to avoid moving the dust on the top of the socks in \nparticular because moving impurity from one place to another \nmust happen in any case, whether he begins from the heels or the \ntoes, i.e. impurity is moved to the top of the sock more than it is \nmoved to the bottom, since if he were not to wipe the tops, the \nwiping would be invalid, which is not the case with the bottoms. \nHis words must be examined. When he is asked to wipe the mud \nand wash the impure dung before wiping, how can it be \nunderstood that it is moving an impurity from one place to \nanother, top or otherwise, whether he begins to wipe from the \nheals or the toes?  \n \n7.2e Actual mud  \n \nBut if there is any actual mud on the bottom of your socks \nyou should not wipe over it until it has been removed in \nany case.  \n \ni.e. it is obliged to remove it according to the position that it is \nobligatory to wipe the bottom and recommended according to the \nother statement.  \n \n \n \nChapter Eight: On the Times of the Prayers \nand Their Names \n \n \nThis chapter deals with the recognition of the times of prayer. It is \nan individual obligation for every legally responsible person to \nknow their times if he can do that. If he cannot do that, as when \nsomeone is blind, he follows someone else. The \"time\" designates \nthe amount of time allotted for an act of worship in the Shari‟ah. \nIt is either the time of performing it or the time of making it up. \nThe time of performing is either the optional (ikhtiyari) time, \nmeaning the time in which a legally responsible person can choose \nwhen to perform the prayer at any part of it, or it‟s  imperative \n(daruri) time.  \n \nThe optional can be either the time of excellence or the time of \nleeway. As regards the prayer, what is meant by it in the usage of \nthe people of the Shari‟ah is a body of rak'ats and prostration‟s, \nwhich are transmitted from the supplication (which is the \nlinguistic meaning) since it contains the Fatiha which contains the \nsupplication, which is \"Guide us\" other suras than the Fatiha, and \nit is that whose obligation is known from the Din as necessity. The \none who denies it is an apostate and is asked to repent. If he \nrepents, he is all right. Otherwise he is killed. It is like that with \nthe one who denies the rest of the pillars of Islam which are: the \nshahadah, zakat, fasting and hajj.  \n \nIts preconditions  \n \nThere are five preconditions for its being obligatory:   \n \nIslam,  \n \nAdulthood  \n \nSanity  \n \nLack of bleeding from menstruation and lochia, and  \n \nThe arrival of the time of the prayer.  \n \nQadi 'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) adds hearing the call to prayer.  \n \nIt is one of the greatest acts of worship because it was prescribed \nin Heaven during the Night Journey. That was in Makka a year \nbefore the Hijra as opposed to the rest of the laws. They were \nprescribed on earth. There is disagreement about how it was \nobliged. 'A'isha (radhi’Allahu anha)  said that they were \nprescribed as two rak'ats at home and in the journey and then it \nwas confirmed in the journey and increased to four when someone \nis resident. It is said that four rak'ats were obliged except for \nMaghrib, which was three and Subh, which was two. Then in the \njourney they were shortened to two rak'ats. As for knowing the \nnames of the prayers, that is also obligatory because it is by their \nnames that there is distinction and specification because if the \nprayer is not specified, then the prayer is invalid.  \n \n8.1 Subh  \n \n8.1a Its name  \n \nAccording to the people of Madina the middle prayer is the \nearly morning prayer, namely the dawn prayer.  \n \nIt is evident that a multiplicity names is indicative of the honor of \nthe named. There are four names given to this prayer: as-Subh, al-\nWusta (the middle), al-Fajr and al-Ghada. Subh is derived from \nsabah, which is whiteness since it becomes obligatory at this time. \nFajr is derived from infijar (bursting forth) since it is obliged when \ndawn breaks from the darkness of the night.  \n \n8.1b The Beginning of its time  \n \nThe beginning of the time for this prayer is when dawn \nbreaks and the light spreads out in the extreme east, going \nfrom the qibla to behind the qibla, [1] until it rises up and \nfills the whole horizon.  \n \nThe beginning of its ikhtiyari time is when dawn breaks and the \nlight of dawn which comes from the light of the sun spreads out. It \nsometimes rises from the extreme east and sometimes elsewhere \nand follows it. The place of its breaking is the place where the sun \nrises. This excludes the false dawn which is the whiteness like the \ntail of a wolf, which thins and does not spread. It has no \njurisdiction.  \n \nThe light of dawn continues until it fills up the entire horizon. \nShaikh ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) thought this was unclear \nand said that the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the light \nis in the extreme east and so it is clear that it rises in the extreme \neast. \"Going from the qibla to behind the qibla\" means that it rises \nfrom the qibla. It might give rise to the idea that the qibla has a \nbehind, but it is not like that. Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) replies that the qibla and the east are the same. It is what \nis opposite the west. \"Behind\" means the middle. When the qibla \nis hidden from him, he faces the east and puts the west behind \nhim. Then he is facing it because his deviation from the qibla is \nslight.  \n \n1. This must necessarily refer to North Africa, where the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) lived. The commentators are not sure of the \nexact meaning of this phrase.  \n \n8.1c The end of the time  \n \nThe end of the time is when the light has got very bright so \nthat someone ending the prayer says the salam just as the \nedge of the sun appears over the horizon.  \n \nThe end of the time of Subh. This is derived from that fact the end \nof the ikhtiyari time for Subh is sunrise, and it is the well-known \nposition of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-\nBarr (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is that on which the people \nact. Qadi 'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) attributes it to all the \nscholars and Imams of fatwa. On that basis there is no daruri time \nfor Subh. In the Mudawwana, which is approved, and on whose \nbasis the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar proceeds, \nthe ikhtiyari time is from the rising of true dawn until the upper \nbrightening, and the end is when the upper brightening leaves \nand it is that time in which faces can be seen in a place without a \nroof or covering by someone with average sight. Then the daruri \ntime of Subh is from the beginning of the upper brightening to the \nfirst part of sunrise.  \n \n8.1d Its scope  \n \nAny time between these two points is acceptable but the \nbeginning of the time is the best.  \n \nIt is established that the time of the Subh prayer is the breaking \nof dawn and the end of the time is the clear brightening. The \nprayer can occur in any of that time if he is not excessive because \nthe beginning and end of time subject to choice are equal unless it \nis negated by a constriction. However if he thinks that he will die \nbefore he does it if he does not occupy himself with it, then there is \nagreement that he rebels by leaving it because the wide time then \nbecomes constricted in respect of him, i.e. whoever thinks that he \nwill die during the time must pray early in that time. If he does \nnot pray in that time in which he must pray, he sins whether he \ndies or not. In this respect, other impediments to prayer which \noccur are the same as death, like menstruation. If a woman delays \nand the impediment occurs, she does not make it because the lack \nof making up does not negate the wrong action.  \n \nThen it is affirmed that the ikhtiyari time is all the same unless it \nis negated by a constriction, but you should know that they vary \nin excellence. The early part is absolutely better, whether in \nsummer or winter, individually or in a group. It is like that \naccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and most of the \nschools in order to obtain the virtue of the time. The basis in this \nis that it is sound that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nused to pray Subh when it was still dark as did the Rashidun \nkhalifs (may Allah azza wa jall bless them all).  \n \n8.2 Dhuhr  \n \n8.2a The time of Dhuhr  \n \nThe time of Dhuhr is from when the sun has passed the \nzenith, and that is when the shadows start to get longer.  \n \nThe beginning of the time where there is choice is when the sun \nbegins to decline and has passed the zenith. Then the shadows \nbegin to increase as the sun moves. It is known as \"zawal\": that \ncomes from the fact that when a stick it set upright, it is that \npoint between the increase and decrease of the shadow, and so it \nis not simply the shadow cast, but has to do with its increase.  \n \n8.2b Delaying Dhuhr  \n \nIt is recommended to delay the prayer in summer until the \nshadow of an object reaches a quarter of the length of that \nobject added to the length of its shadow at noon.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is delayed in \nthe summer rather than the winter, in a group or individually. \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"His words 'in the \nsummer' are not understood. It can be like that in the winter.\" \nDelay is recommended until the time mentioned about the \nshadow. The shadow is not measured from its root, but from the \nshadow after noon. However that is an unusual linguistic usage. \nThe well-known usage is that the shadow (dhill) is until midday \ncomes and the shadow is after it is called fay'.  \n \n8.2c In Masjids  \n \nIt is also said that this practice is only recommended as far \nas masjids are concerned so that more people can catch the \nprayer, and that it is better for a man praying by himself to \ndo the prayer at the beginning of the time. \n  \nThis delaying is said to be only about the masjid, so that people \ncan join in the prayer. As for someone on his own, it is better to \npray at the beginning of the time because there is no benefit in \ndelaying it.  \n \n8.2d In intense heat  \n \nIt is also said that it is better to delay the prayer until it is \na little cooler, when the heat is fierce, even if you are \npraying by yourself since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Delay the prayer until it gets a little cooler \nbecause the fierceness of the heat is from the flames of \nJahannam.\"  \n \nThis is when the intensity of heat abates. So there are three \npositions about waiting for the cooling in the case of Dhuhr. Either \nit is absolutely recommended to delay it for individual and the \ngroup, or the recommendation is confined to the masjid for the \ngroup, and the third is to make a distinction between strong heat \nand other times, and so it is recommended in the case of intense \nheat for both the group and the individual.  \n \nThe expression in the Muwatta' is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"When the heat is fierce, then delay the \nprayer until it gets cooler, for scorching heat is from the blast of \nJahannam.\" It means to wait for some shade and for the intensity \nof the heat to abate. The hadith about hastening the prayer is \nabrogated by this hadith. It is that the Holy prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) prayed Dhuhr at midday at the time of intense heat.  \n \n8.2e The end of the time  \n \nThe end of the time of Dhuhr is when the shadow of an \nobject is the same length as that object in addition to the \nlength of its shadow at noon.  \n \nThis is the end of the ikhtiyari time for Dhuhr. The consideration \nof day here is from sunrise to sunset, as opposed to the day in \nfasting which begins when dawn breaks.  \n \n8.3 'Asr  \n \n8.3a The beginning of 'Asr and end of Dhuhr  \n \nThe beginning of the time of 'Asr is the end of the time of \nDhuhr  \n \nThe beginning of the ikhtiyari time of 'Asr is the end of the \nikhtiyari time of Dhuhr. On this basis, they share in the same \ntime for the amount of four rak'ats or 'Asr shares with Dhuhr at \nthe end of its time for the amount of four rak'ats. According to the \nfirst, if Dhuhr is delayed until the time of 'Asr begins and Dhuhr \nis done at the beginning of the time, he incurs no wrong action. \nAccording to this, if someone prays 'Asr at the end of the first \nlength, it is invalid. According to the second, if he prays 'Asr while \nthere still remains the time for four rak'ats of the time of Dhur at \nthe beginning of the second length, he commits a wrong action \nsince he does it before the time of the other has ended.  \n \n8.3b The end of the time of 'Asr  \n \nIts end is when the shadow of an object is twice the length \nof that object in addition to the length of its shadow at \nnoon.  \n \nThis is the end of the ikhtiyari time of 'Asr.  \n \n8.3c Another view  \n \nIt is also said that if, standing upright facing the sun with \nyour eyes looking straight ahead, you can see the sun, then \nthe time of 'Asr has arrived. If you cannot see the sun the \ntime has not yet begun. If the sun has descended right into \nyour field of vision you are well into the time. According to \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) the time for 'Asr lasts \nuntil the sun begins to turn yellow.  \n \nAnother view of the beginning of the time: this is with the head \nslightly bowed but not properly bowed (proper bowing is when the \neyes are facing the ground.) Then if the sun comes into your line of \nsight, it is 'Asr. Some people deny that the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said this since its speaker is not known. The reply to him is \nthat the arrival of the time is not known because this not apply at \nall times because the sun is high in the summer and low in the \nwinter.  \n \nIn defining the end of the ikhtiyari time of 'Asr from the \ntransmission of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), it is \nwhen the sun begins to turn yellow in the earth. The position of \nthe school is that it is better to perform 'Asr in the beginning of \nthe time.  \n \n8.4 Maghrib  \n \n8.4a The time of Maghrib  \n \nThe time of Maghrib - also known as the prayer of the one \nwho is resident, meaning that a traveler does not shorten it \nbut prays it in the same way as someone who is resident - \nis at sunset.  \n \nThis is the ikhtiyari time. The Maghrib prayer has two names. \nThis is because it occurs at sunset, and the other name is ash-\nShahid, meaning resident. This is because the traveler prays it \nthe same as the resident. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that the reason Maghrib is called Shahid is because the \ntraveler does not shorten it as is the case with Subh. Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that it is heard but \nit is not analogous because Subh is not so-named.  \n \n8.4b Its Time  \n \nWhen the sun has completely disappeared below the \nhorizon, the prayer is due and it should not be delayed. \nThis moment is the time for this prayer and it should not \nbe delayed beyond it.  \n \nWhat is observed in that is the disappearance of its body and \ncircular orb, not its traces and its rays. Shaikh ibn Bashir \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that this applies to a location where \nthere are no mountains. When there are mountains, he looks \ntowards the east and when darkness appears, that is an indication \nof its setting. When it disappears and sets, i.e. we can no longer \nsee it because of the intervening barrier between us and it, then \nits time has begun and the prayer is not delayed. Maghrib only \nhas one ikhtiyari time. When it is delayed, it moves into its daruri \ntime. The well-known position is that it is not extensive. Indeed \nthe amount required for doing it after the preconditions of its time \nexist is narrow. It is permitted for the one who obtains its \npreconditions of purity, sutra, facing qibla, the adhan and iqama, \nto delay doing it for the necessary time required to achieve its \npreconditions. It is also said that its time extends to the \ndisappearance of the red twilight. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and many of the people of the Madhhab prefer it because of \nwhat is in the Muwatta' where Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays, \"When the redness has gone, then the 'Isha' prayer is due \nand you have left the time of Maghrib,\" and what is in Muslim of \nthe words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The time \nof Maghrib lasts as long as the red twilight has not gone.\"  \n \n8.5 'Isha'  \n \n8.5a Its name  \n \nThe ikhtiyari time for 'Atama or 'Isha', and Isha' is the \nrecommended name for it because it was used in the Noble Book. \nA group of scholars, including Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), \ndislike calling it 'Atama . As for what is related in the Muwatta', \nthe Musnad of Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the two \nSahih collections from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radhi’Allahu \nanhu), \"If they had known what is in 'Atama and Subh, they \nwould have come to them, even crawling\" where it is called \n'Atama, that clarifies that it is permitted and not unlawful to call \nit that, and there is no contradiction with the fact that it is \ndisliked.  \n \n8.5b The time of 'Isha'  \n \nThe time of the prayer of darkness or 'Isha', the latter \nbeing the better name for it, is when their is no redness \nremaining in the sky from the remaining rays of the sun. \nWhen all yellowness and redness has gone, the time of \n'Isha' has arrived. No attention need be paid to any \nwhiteness which may remain on the western horizon.  \n \nThe time of 'Isha' is when the redness in the direction of the \nsunset has disappeared, not the entire west, as the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) states. Note that he mentioned yellowness \nfirst, even though it is later than redness. However, in Arabic the \nwaw (and) does not demand sequence.  \n \nThe comment about the whiteness is in reference to the statement \nof Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the \"shafq\" \n(twilight) is the whiteness. Our evidence is what ad-Daraqutni \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"The twilight is the redness. When the twilight \ndeparts, then the prayer is obligatory.\" This is the beginning of the \nikhtiyari time.  \n \n8.5c The end of its time  \n \nThe time for 'Isha' extends from this time until a third of \nthe night has passed for those who want to delay doing it \nbecause of working or some other good reason.  \n \nIt ends with the first third according to the well-known position. \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it extends to the \nmiddle of the night. It can be delayed for someone with an excuse, \nlike work, and it should only be delayed from its early time by \nthose with excuses. Other people, even if they are alone, should \nhasten to perform the 'Isha' prayer at the beginning of it its time. \nThis is recommended.  \n \n8.5d Delaying in the masjids  \n \nIt is better to do it as early as possible although there is no \nharm in delaying it a little in masjids to allow time for \npeople to gather.  \n \n\"There is no harm\" means it is recommended to delay the prayer \nin the masjids to allow people to gather. The author's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) premise is weak, and it is preferred that it is \nalways advanced to the beginning of the time.  \n \n8.5e After the prayer  \n \nSleeping before doing 'Isha' is disliked and so is talking \nafter it unless there is a good reason for it.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu) said, \"It is disliked to \ntalk after it more than it is disliked to sleep before it because the \nperson might miss the virtues of the prayer of Subh in group or \nmiss its time or miss rising for tahajjud and Dhikr‟Allah in the \nnight. An exception to that is discussing knowledge and acts of \nnearness to Allah azza wa jall. Exceptions to this are the \nbridegroom, the guest and the traveler, i.e. someone who has \narrived from a journey or is going on a journey, and whatever need \ndemands like talking connected to someone's best interests, like \nbuying and selling.  \n \n8.6 Daruri Times  \n \nThe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) spoke about the ikhtiyari time \nand not the daruri time. Subh was already mentioned. The daruri \ntime of Dhuhr begins at the beginning of the second length and \nthat of 'Asr begins with the yellowing and ends at sunset, \nalthough 'Asr is particular to four rak'ats before sunset. This time \nis daruri for it in particular so that if you pray Dhuhr in that time, \nit is making it up. It begins in Maghrib when it can be finished \nwithout negligence, i.e. follows finishing it. it. That of 'Isha' begins \nwith second third of the night and ends when the dawn rises. The \nlast of it is the amount of four rak‟ats, as there is between Dhuhr \nand 'Asr.  \n \nThese times are called daruri times because it is not permitted to \ndelay the prayer until them except for the people of necessity \n(darura), and the people of necessity are menstruating women, a \nwoman with bleeding on account of childbirth, the unbeliever, the \napostate, the child, the mad person, the person who is \nunconscious, the sleeper and the one who forgets. So when the \nimpediment is removed from any of those, he prays in the daruri \ntime and incurs no wrong action. Anyone who prays in these times \nexcept those with an excuse are disobedient.  \n \n \n \nChapter Nine: On the Adhan and the Iqama \n \n \nLinguistically adhan means informing, whatever it is, and in the \nShari‟ah it is informing people of the times of prayer with \nparticular words.  \n \n9.1 The Adhan  \n \n9.1a Its obligatory nature  \n \nIt is obligatory to call the adhan in masjids and wherever \npeople meet regularly to do the prayer.  \n \nThe judgment of the adhan is that it is an obligation in the form of \nthe sunan, i.e. it is a confirmed Sunnah, in the masjids. It is clear \nfrom his words that there is no difference between the communal \nmasjid, i.e. that in which Jumu'a is held, and masjids other than \ncommunal. There is also no difference between the masjids being \nclose together or whether there is one masjid on top of another. It \nis also done is places where groups meet regularly to pray.  \n \nIt is clear that it is done whether it is in masjids or elsewhere \nsince they seek to call others to the prayers. Every group seeks \nothers. Even if it is not a regular prayer, then it is Sunnah for \nthere to be an adhan. The regular group differs from the irregular \nin that it is a group in a settled place where they do not wait for \nothers in a place outside of a masjid, and so the adhan is not \nSunnah for them nor is it recommended. Indeed, it is disliked. \nHowever in a journey, the adhan is recommended. It is \nrecommended for someone who is alone on a journey to do the \nadhan.  \n \nIt is unlawful to do the adhan before the time has come, and it is \ndisliked for the Sunnah‟s as it is disliked for missed prayers and \nin the daruri time and the general obligation. The evidence for the \nSunnah nature of the adhan is his command and the perseverance \nof the people of the Din on it in his time and after his time. This is \nthe exact Sunnah.  \n \n9.1b Someone who is alone  \n \nIf you are alone it is good to do the adhan  \n \nIt is recommended to do it, whether at home or on a journey. The \nwell- known position is that this applies particularly to the \ntraveler rather than the resident since it is true that Abu Sa‟id \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) heard the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) say, \"When you are in your desert or among your sheep \ngive the adhan. No man or jinn or anything within range hears \nthe voice of the mu'adhdhan without bearing witness for him on \nthe Day of Rising.\"  \n \n9.1c Status of Iqama  \n \nA man must do the iqama  \n \nIt is confirmed that the legally responsible person is obliged to do \nthe iqama if he is a man. Shaikh ibn Kinana (rahmatullahi alaihi) \napplies the words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) to the \nobligation, saying that if someone omits it deliberately, his prayer \nis invalid. Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) considers \nit Sunnah, i.e. the individual Sunnah for an adult who prays, even \nif it is a missed prayer or he is alone, or an Imam of only women. \nand it is enough for a group prayer of only men or one in which \nthere are women as well in respect of the Imam and men. The \niqama is more confirmed than the adhan because it is connected to \nthe prayer. If there is a gap between them, the iqama is invalid \nand must be said again.\"  \n \n9.1d Women and the Iqama  \n \nbut for a woman it is only recommended and if she doesn't \ndo it does not matter.  \n \nA woman commits no wrong action by omitting it.  \n \n9.1e When the Adhan is done  \n \nThe adhan for a prayer should not be done before the time \nof that prayer  \n \nThe aim of prescribing the adhan is to announce the arrival of the \ntime, to inform those legally responsible that the time has come so \nthat they can fulfill the obligation imposed on them. Therefore it is \ndone after the time has come. It is not permitted to give the adhan \nbefore the time for any of the five prayers, even Jumu'a, i.e. it is \nunlawful. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \nadhan for Jumu'a is given before the zenith while it is only prayed \nafter it.  \n \n9.1f The case of Subh  \n \nexcept in the case of Subh when there is no harm in calling \nthe adhan in the last sixth of the night.  \n \n\"No harm\" means that it is recommended to give the adhan in the \nlast two hours of the night before dawn and then to give it again \nwhen the time comes in order to follow the Sunnah. The first \nadhan is recommended and the second is Sunnah. Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) gives the adhan at half of the night. \nImam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) does not have an adhan \nbefore its time like the other prayers. We have what is in the \nSahih that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Bilal \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) calls the adhan while it is still night, so eat \nand drink until ibn Umm Maktum (radhi’Allahu anha) calls the \nadhan.\" Shaikh al-Bistami (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nexact position of the people of the Madhhab is that it is given in \nthe last sixth.\"  \n \n9.1g Description  \n \nThe adhan consists of the words:  \n \nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.  \nAsh-hadu an la ilaha ill’Allah. Ash-hadu an la ilaha \nill’Allah.  \nAsh-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Ash-hadu anna \nMuhammadan Rasulullah.  \nHayya 'ala's-salah Hayya 'ala's-salah.  \nHayya 'ala'l-Falah. Hayya 'ala'l-Falah.  \n \nThen you repeat it in a louder voice than the first time, \nrepeating the testimony. You say: Ash-hadu an la ilaha \nill’Allah. Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Ash-\nhadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah. Hayya 'ala's-salah \nHayya ala’s-salah.  \n \nHayya means to come quickly without haste that would cause you \nto lose tranquillity and gravity. Haste is disliked then, even if he \nfears missing the group. Success is obtaining bliss in the Next \nWorld.  \n \n9.1h Subh  \n \nThen if you are calling the adhan for Subh you add here: \nAs-Salatu khayrun min'n-nawm. As-Salatu khayrun min'n-\nnawm. This is not said in the adhan for any other prayer. \nAllahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. La ilaha ill’Allah. The last \nphrase is only said once.  \n \nEven if he is in a desert and there is no one else there. This is the \nexpression and it means that waking up for the prayer is better \nthan the rest obtained by sleep. They disagree about the one who \ncommanded this sentence, i.e. \"The prayer is better than sleep.\" It \nis said that it was the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and it \nis said that it was 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu).  \n \n9.2 The Iqama  \n \nThe phrases in the iqama are said only once. It consists of:  \n \nAllahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.  \nAsh-hadu an la ilaha ill’Allah.  \nAsh-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah.  \nHayya 'ala's-salati  \nHayya 'ala'l-falahi.  \nQad qamati’s-salah Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar  \nLa ilaha ill’Allah  \n \nThe expressions are said once except for the takbir. Making it \nsingle is the Madhhab. When it is made double by mistake, it is \nnot allowed in the well-known position. So if error and \nforgetfulness do not suffice, it is more likely that the deliberate \ndoes not suffice either.  \n \n \n \nChapter Ten: On How to Do the Fard Prayers \nand the Sunnah and Nafila Prayers \nConnected with Them \n \n \n \n10.1 The Form of the Prayer  \n \n10.1a The state of Ihram  \n \nGoing into the state of ihram as far as the prayer is \nconcerned is by saying Allahu Akbar and no other \nexpression is acceptable.  \n \nIs ihram the intention or the takbir or both while facing qibla? \nShaikh al-Ajhurri (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers the later. \nAccording to the first, the idafa is their words \"takbir al-Ihram\" is \nthe relation of the associate to its associate. According to the \nsecond, it is for clarification. According to the third, is part of the \nidafa of the part to the whole, i.e. the beginning of the attribute is \nihram. It is to enter. This applies to all prayers, obligatory or \nsupererogatory.  \n \n10.1b The Takbir  \n \n \nIt is to say, \"Allahu Akbar\" with a natural extension for the \namount of an alif (Allah). If he fails to do that, then his ihram is \nnot valid. No other expression is acceptable if he speaks good \nArabic. If he does not speak good Arabic, then Shaikh Abdu'l-\nWahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he enters the prayer by \nthe intention except for the non-Arab. Shaikh Abu'l-Faraj \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says he enters it in his own language, but \nthis is weak, even if the prayer is not invalidated by analogy with \nthe dislike of the supplication in non-Arabic by the one who can do \nit in Arabic. But what is relied on is the first statement. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) calls this sentence a \"word\" following \ngrammatical usage.  \n \nThe takbir is obligatory for the Imam and the person praying \nalone by agreement, and in respect for the one following in the \nwell-known position. It is related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the Imam bears the responsibility of the takbir al-\nihram for the follower. If the Imam omits the takbir al-ihram, \nintentionally or by forgetfulness, then his prayer is invalid as is \nthe prayer of those following. The evidence for its obligatory \nnature is found in the two Sahih collections where the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The key to the prayer is \npurification and its sanctification is the takbir and its ending is \nthe taslim.\" Purification is general and includes wudu' and ghusl.  \n \nA precondition of the takbir is that it is done while standing, and \nit is agreed that it cannot be done before that. If that is omitted in \nthe obligatory prayer, in that he says it sitting, or bending, or \nleaning on some support in such a manner that if it were removed, \nhe would fall, then his prayer is invalid.  \n \nA precondition of the takbir al-ihram is that it be accompanied by \nthe intention. If it comes after it, then it is agreed that it is not \nallowed. The same applies if it is a lot before it. There are two \nwell-known positions about whether it can be a little before it. One \nsays that it is allowed and the other is that it is not. The preferred \none is that it is allowed since it is not transmitted from them that \nit is a precondition of the accompaniment. The meaning of the \nprecondition that it accompany it according to the second position \nis that it is not permitted for there to be a gap between the \nintention and the takbir. It is not a precondition that the intention \nactually accompany the takbir.  \n \n10.1c Raising the Hands in the Takbir  \n \nAt the same time your raise your hands level with your \nshoulders, or lower  \n \nWhen you say the takbir, it is recommended to raise your hands. \nTheir backs are towards sky and palms to earth, level with the \nshoulders or a little lower, i.e. the top of the chest. This is for the \nman. As for the woman, it is a little less than that. Shaikh al-\nQarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that consensus on that. There \nis disagreement about the judgment of this raising of the hands. \nSome believe that it is Sunnah and some that it is a meritorious \nact, which is what is accepted. The words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) state that rising is particular to the takbir \nal-ihram. It is like that in the well-known position. It is also stated \nthat he raises them in ruku' and in rising from two rak'ats.  \n \n10.1d Recitation  \n \nand then begin the recitation.  \n \nThe takbir is followed by the recitation without any division \nbetween them. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked for \nthere to be glorification and supplication between the Takbir al-\nIhram and the recitation. Some of them recommend separating \nthem with the words, \"Glory be to You, O Allah, and by Your \npraise. Blessed is Your name and exalted is Your majesty. There \nis no god but You.\"  \n \n10.1e How to do Subh  \n \nIf you are doing Subh you recite the Fatiha out loud.  \n \nThe recitation of the Fatiha is obligatory in Subh and other \nobligatory prayers for the Imam and the one praying alone. There \nare two positions by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in the \nMudawwana about whether it is in every rak'at or most. The \nsound one is that it is obligatory in every rak'at. Shaikh ibn al-\nHajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. In general, it means one \nrak'at, even if it is Subh, Jumu'a or the travel prayer.  \n \nAs for the one following an Imam, it is recommended for him in \nwhat the Imam says silently. As for recitation in what is done out \nloud, it is Sunnah.  \n \n10.1f Basmala  \n \nYou do not say bismi'llahi-r-rahmani'r-rahim for the \nFatiha nor for the sura which comes after it  \n \nWhen he recites in Subh or other obligatory prayers, he does not \nrecite the basmala in it at all, not in the Fatiha nor in the sura \nafter it, silently or aloud, whether Imam or following. The \nprohibition in the words designates dislike since it is true that \n'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"My father \nheard me saying, 'bismi'llahi-r- rahmani'r-rahim ' and he said, 'My \nson, beware of new things. Beware of doing something new which \nthe Chosen one (alaihi salat wa salam) and his Companions did \nnot do.' 'Abdullah ibn Mughaffal (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I did \nnot see a man among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) who more hated new things in Islam than him. \nHe was the strongest of the Companions in hating the new. Part of \nthe words of my father were, 'I prayed with the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam), Abu Bakr (radhi’Allahu anhu), 'Umar \n(radhi’Allahu anhu)  and 'Uthman (radhi’Allahu anhu), and I \ndid not hear any of them say it. So do not say it when you recite. \nRather begin with, \"Praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the worlds,\" \netc. When you recite in the voluntary prayers, then there is scope. \nIf you wish, recite it. If you wish, do not recite it.'\" He disliked \nseeking refuge (saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah\") in the \nobligatory rather than the voluntary prayer.  \n \n10.1g Saying \"Amin\"  \n \nIf you are by yourself or behind an Imam you say amin \nafter the words, wala'd-daalleen, but you do not say it out \nloud. An Imam does not say amin if he is reciting out loud \nbut he does if the recitation is silent. There is, however, a \ndifference of opinion about whether the Imam should say \namin when the recitation is out loud.  \n \nIt is recommended to say it. \"Amin\" means \"Answer!\" You do this \nwhether you are praying alone in a silent or loud prayer or if you \nare praying behind an Imam in a silent or loud prayer when you \nhear him say \"Wala'd-dalleen.\" You do not say it out loud, but \nsilently, even if the prayer is out loud. In other words, it is \ndisliked to say it out loud and recommended to say it silently.  \n \nIt is disliked for the Imam to say it if the prayer is out loud, and it \nis agreed that he says it in the silent prayer. However, there is \ndisagreement about the Imam saying it when the prayer is out \nloud.  \n \n10.1h Reciting the sura  \n \nAfter that you recite ...  \n \nAfter reciting the Fatiha, without any separation between them in \nthe form of supplication or anything else. The judgment of the \nrecitation of a whole sura after the Fatiha is that it is \nrecommended and Sunnah. There must be more than the Fatiha, \neven if it is one ayat or part of an ayat . The evidence for the \nSunnah is being more that the Fatiha is that the prostration of \nforgetfulness or lack of it is based on reciting more than the \nFatiha, not the sura. If he does more than the Fatiha, there is no \nprostration. Otherwise he prostrates.  \n \nIt is deduced from his words, \"a sura\" that he does not recite two \nsuras in the same rak'at. That is the best for the Imam and the \none praying alone. There is no harm in someone following the \nImam doing that.  \n \n10.1i What is recited in Subh  \n \none of the larger suras from the mufassal. If the sura you \nrecite is longer than that, that is good so long as it is not \ngetting too light  \n \nThe sura which he recites in Subh should be one of the long \nmufassal, the first of which is al-Hujurat (Holy Qur‟an 49) \naccording to the accepted position. There are other positions, \nsaying from ash-Shura (Holy Qur‟an 42), or from al-Jathiyya (Holy \nQur‟an 45), or from al-Fath (Holy Qur‟an 48) or from an-Najm \n(Holy Qur‟an 53), and extends to 'Abasa (Holy Qur‟an 80). The \nmedium ones are from 'Abasa (Holy Qur‟an 80) to ad-Duha (Holy \nQur‟an 93), and from ad-Duha (Holy Qur‟an 93) to the end. They \nare called mufassal because of the great number of divisions by \nthe basmalas.  \n \nIt is good if the sura which he recites in the first rak'at of Subh is \nlonger than one of the long muffasal, in that you are near a sura \nwhich is one of the long mufassal, not that your recite al-Baqara \n(Holy Qur‟an 2) or its like. This length is in respect to the Imam of \na limited number of people who are content with that or someone \non his own who is strong enough for that. Otherwise, it is best not \nto make it long. \"Good\" here means recommended, and his words \nimply that the Sunnah is only obtained by reciting one of the long \nmufassal, and the recommendation is to do more. That is not like \nthat. The Sunnah is obtained, even by reciting an ayat. \"Getting \nlight\" is when the darkness is mixed with light and vice versa \nbefore it begins to brighten. It is understood from his words that \nwhen it is like that, he does not make it long.  \n \n10.1j The recitation is out loud in Subh  \n \nThe sura is also recited out loud.  \n \nIt is Sunnah to recite the sura and the Fatiha out loud.  \n \n10.1k Ruku'  \n \nWhen you have finished the sura you say Allahu Akbar as \nyou go down into ruku' - the bowing position of the prayer.  \n \nYou say the takbir as you go down. Three things are taken from \nhis words about ruku'. One is the takbir, which is Sunnah. Are all \nof them except the takbir al-Ihram as one Sunnah? That is what \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says and most of the \nscholars take that position. Some say that every takbir is a \nseparate Sunnah, and that is the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and it is predominant view. The evidence \nfor it being predominant is that they stipulate the prostration of \nforgetfulness for omitting two of them. If all of them had been a \nSunnah, then they would not have imposed because there is no \nprostration for omitting a part. The upshot of that is that if one \ntakbir is omitted - except for the takbir of the „Id - by \nforgetfulness, he does not prostrate. If he prostrates for it before \nthe taslim deliberately or out of ignorance, then his prayer is \ninvalid. If he omits more than one, even all of them, then he \nprostrates. If he omits the prostration and a long time passes, \nthen there is a difference according to the two positions. According \nto the statement that all is one Sunnah, then the prayer is not \ninvalid by omitting three or more. According to the other, it is \ninvalid when the prostration is omitted since the second mentions \nthat the takbir is connected to ruku', and is recommended. It is \nlike with every action of the prayer except for standing after two \nrak'ats.  \n \nThe Ruku' position  \n \nYou put your hands on your knees, straightening your \nback so it is parallel to the ground.  \n \nRuku' is one of the agreed-upon obligations of the prayer and it \nhas three forms: low, middle and high. The low is to place the \nhands near the knees. The middle is to place them on the knees \nwithout firmness, and the high is that which the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) indicated here.  \n \nPutting the hands on the knees is recommended, if they are both \nsound and he is not prevented from putting them on them by some \nimpediment. An impediment would be amputation or shortening. \nHe does not bend any further than having his back straight. \nHaving the back straight is not obligatory. It is recommended \nsince the obligation is general - bowing is obligatory. Its fullest \nform is to place the hands on the knees. It is recommended for him \nto spread his fingers based on what Shaikh al-Hakim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh al-Bayhaqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ntransmitted that when he (alaihi salat wa salam) bowed, he \nspread his fingers, and then he prostrated, he kept them together.  \n \nIt is recommended that the back be straight. The author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned both placing the hands on the \nknees and keeping the back straight since one of them does not \nnecessitate the other. Keeping the back straight does not \nnecessitate placing the hands on the knees and placing the hands \non the knees does not necessitate keeping the back straight. Are \nboth of them recommended or is simply one of them alone \nrecommended?  \n \nThe position of the head in ruku'  \n \nYou do not lift your head nor do you let it drop. You make \nsure that the insides of your arms are away from your \nsides.  \n \nThis is recommended. Omitting any of that does not invalidate the \nprayer. It is recommended that the insides of the arms be far from \nthe sides. That is explained as being not very far, but a medium \namount. This does not apply to both men and women. Women \nkeep their arms to the sides. He does not mention the straightness \nof the knees, and he is not excessive in bowing by making them \nstraight. He is also silent about the straightness of the feet which \nis that they are not right together. That is disliked. It is \nrecommended that it be avoided.  \n \n10.1l Awareness in ruku'  \n \nIn both ruku' and sujud you should be aware of your state \nof complete submission.  \n \nYour heart must be humble. This is recommended as is well-\nknown with the fuqaha'. Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that it is one of its obligations although the prayer is not \ninvalidated if it is omitted. It is an obligatory in part of it, and \nmust exist in the ihram.  \n \nWhat to say after that  \n \nAnd then if you are by yourself you say, Allahumma \nRabbana wa laka'l-hamd (O Allah, our Lord, all praise \nbelongs to You.) This is not said by the Imam. Someone \npraying behind an Imam does not say Sami'a'llahu liman \nhamidah, but he does say, Allahumma Rabbana wa laka'l-\nhamd.  \n \nThen you say, \"O Allah, our Lord, all praise belongs to You\", \nmeaning You accept and You are praised for accepting or for your \nallowing that act of worship to be completed. You say this if you \nare alone or behind the Imam. The Imam only says the first \nstatement. Someone praying behind an Imam only says, \"O Allah, \nour Lord, all praise belongs to You\". The basis for these details is \nin the Muwatta' and elsewhere which report that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When the Imam says, 'Allah \nhears whoever praises Him,' say, 'O Allah, our Lord, all praise \nbelongs to You' for the previous wrong actions done by the one \nwhose utterance coincides with that of the angels are forgiven,\" \ni.e. both minor and major. They are only expiated by repentance or \nthe pardon of Allah azza wa jall. In a version of Shaikh at-\nTirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi), \"Praise is Yours,\" This hadith \ndemands that the Imam does not say, \"Our Lord, praise is Yours,\" \nand the one following does not say, \"Allah hears whoever praises \nHim.\"  \n \n10.1m Standing up straight after ruku'  \n \nYou stand up straight, still, and with the limbs settled  \n \nWhen you lift your head from ruku', you stand up straight and \nstill. There are two things here: stillness, which is obligatory and \nwill be discussed, and straightness, which is the Sunnah according \nto Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) in all the pillars of \nthe \nprayer \nand \nobligatory \naccording \nto \nShaikh \nAshhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and it is sound. The difference between \nstillness and straightness is that straightness has to do with \nstature and stillness involves the limbs resisting for a time.  \n \n10.1n Prostration \n  \nand then go down into sujud without going into a sitting \nposition on the way.  \n \nThen you go down to the ground in prostration, going into \nprostration from a standing position as the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did. There is no disagreement that prostration is \nobligatory. You do not prostate from a sitting position as some \npeople of knowledge say. It is useful to be precise. Imam ash-\nShafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that a very slight sitting before \nprostration is part of the Sunnah. The argument of some of the \npeople of knowledge that he did that and the argument of one who \ndenies that he sat before prostration is what is related from \n'A'isha (radhi’Allahu anha) that he (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nthat at the end of his life because the movement of his noble limbs \nhad become heavy. It was not to change the Sunnah. It was due to \nan excuse, and it is negated when the excuse does not exist. If this \nsitting occurs by forgetfulness, and is not long, there is no harm. If \nit is long, then he prostrates on account of it. There is \ndisagreement about when it is deliberate. That famous position is \nthat if it is not long, there is no harm. If it is long, there is harm. \nLength is considered inasmuch as someone looking would think \nthat he has turned away from the prayer.  \n \nThe takbir  \n \nAs you go down into sujud you say, \"Allahu Akbar.\"  \n \nThis is Sunnah to fulfill the pillar with the takbir. He did not \nmention what touches the earth first. It is recommended to place \nthe hands before the knees when you go into prostration and to \nhave the hands leave the earth after the knees in rising by his \ncommand to do that. That is what the people of Madina did. As for \nwhat the people of the Sunan relate stating that when he \nprostrated, he put his knees down before his hands and when he \ncame he lifted his hands before his knees, ad-Daraqutni \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) said that only Sharik has it, and things are \nsaid about Sharik. Some claim that it is an abrogated Sunnah.  \n \nWhat part of the face is on the ground  \n \nYou put your forehead and nose on the ground  \n \nThe forehead is what is between the temples to the forelock. As \nmuch of it as possible is placed on the ground. This is \nrecommended. As for fulfilling the obligation in that, it is enough \nto place the least amount of the forehead. When he puts his \nforehead on the earth, he should not press it hard on the earth so \nthat it leaves a mark - that it disliked because it is the action of \nthe ignorant who have no knowledge.  \n \nProstration on both the forehead and nose is obligatory. There are \nvarious positions if it is confined to one of them. The famous one is \nthat if it is confined to his nose, it is not enough and he must \nrepeat it. If it is confined to his forehead, it is enough although he \nshould repeat it within the time. It is said to apply to both \nikhtiyari and daruri times. This is if the forehead is sound. If \nthere are ulcers on the forehead, it says in the Mudawwana that \nhe indicates but does not prostrate on his nose because prostration \non the nose naturally demands prostration on the brow. So when \nits obligation does not apply, its consequence does not apply. If he \ngoes down and prostrates on his nose, Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is enough for him because it is \nmore than indication. The Mudawwana says that it is disliked to \nprostrate on his turban.  \n \nPosition of the hands  \n \nwith your palms flat on the ground, fingers facing qibla, on \na level with your ears or further back - there being no fixed \nposition for the hands  \n  \nIt is recommend he put the palms on the ground without barrier. \nIt is recommended for the face and hands to be directly touching \nthe ground because it is humility and that it is disliked to \nprostrate on what is luxurious and comfortable like wool and \ncotton. Matting is overlooked because it is like the earth, but it is \nbest to forego it. Prostration on it is different from the first. The \nfingers are spread out on the earth. This is stressed and it is \nrecommended that they face qibla. Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that the reason for that is that they prostrate and so \nface qibla. Prostration itself is done on the hands, like the knees \nand the toes of the feet, and so it is Sunnah. They should be level \nwith the ears or somewhat further back There is no definition as \nto where the hands are placed based on the statement of the \nMudawwana that there is no definition in that. It is all permitted, \nand there is no obligation. If he does it differently, he only \ncommits something disliked.  \n \nPosition of the Arms  \n \nalthough you must make sure your forearms are not \ntouching the ground. Your arms should not be close \nagainst your sides but should be held out a little \n  \nSince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade for a man \nto rest his forearms on the ground like a wild animal. One variant \nhas \"like a dog.\" It is disliked for a man to do this in prostration \nand it is disliked for him to rest them on his thighs. It is \nforbidden, meaning disliked, for a man to hold his arms close to \nhis sides in prostration. It is recommended for a man to keep his \narms away from his sides as the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did. In the two Sahih collections it reports that in \nprostration he (alaihi salat wa salam) kept his arms from his sides \nso that the white of his armpits could be seen.  \n \nPosition of the Feet  \n \nDuring sujud your feet should be upright with your toes on \nthe ground facing forwards \n  \nThe toes should be facing qibla and the knees should be apart and \nthe stomach away from the thighs. The proof that that is part of \nthe Sunnah is what Abu Dawud \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) \ntransmitted: when the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nprostrated, he had a gap between his thighs and they were not \nagainst his stomach at all.  \n \nWhat to say in sajda  \n \nAnd then when you are in sujud you can say if you like, \n\"Subhaanaka rabbi, dhalamtu nafsi wa 'amiltu suu'an \nfaghfir li.\" (Glory be to You my Lord. I have wronged \nmyself and acted badly, so forgive me.) or if you like you \ncan say something else.  \n \nYou have a choice in what you say between saying the first or not, \nand secondly between these words or other dhikrs. The first choice \nindicates a rejection of the one who says that tasbih is obligatory. \nThe second choice indicates the refutation of the one who says that \nthis must be said, i.e. even if the glorification is recommended, it \nmust be with these words, and so the recommendation is only \nobtained by it. The result is that glorification in prostration is \nrecommended by the author (rahmatullahi alaihi)  and others. The \nexpression of the choice means that taken literally, one sides are \nequal, only indicates the rejection.  \n \nYou can also make du'a' in your sujud if you want  \n \nIt is recommended to make supplication using the Holy Qur'an or \nsomething else, but it must be something permitted in the \nShari‟ah and custom which is not denied, and the prayer is not \ninvalidated by it. This is a separate supplication from the \nglorification.  \n \nLength of prostration  \n \nThere is no particular limit to the length of time you may \nstay in sujud but the shortest is the time it takes for the \nwhole body to become still \n  \nThere is no limit to prostration in the obligatory. For the one \npraying alone, it should not be excessively long. If it is excessively \nlong, it is disliked. There is no harm in it in the voluntary. For the \nImam it is what will not harm those behind him. Its minimum \nwhich is adequate is that in which the joints become still and at \nrest. Stillness is obligatory in the prostration and in all the pillars \nof the prayer. But the Risala only deals with stillness in this place \nabout the minimum which makes the obligatory prostration \nadequate. It is obligatory because that obligation, which is \nprostration, rests on it. There is disagreement about remaining \nlonger than stillness. The view of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nof al-Mukhtasar is that it is Sunnah. He examines what is defined \nas extra in respect of the individual, the Imam and the one \nfollowing, and whether it is equal in the length regarding it and \nother positions of the prayer or not. What is said in al-Mukhtasar \ndemands that all of that be equal.  \n \n10.1o Sitting between prostration’s  \n \nThen, saying, \"Allahu Akbar\", you lift your head and sit \nback. In the sitting position between the two sajdas your \nleft foot is folded underneath and your right foot remains \nupright and you lift your hands from the ground and put \nthem on your knees \n  \nThen you say, \"Allah is greater\" while you are coming up. This \nrising is an obligation without disagreement, and multiple \nprostration‟s are inconceivable without a division between them. \nAfter you lift your head, you must sit straight. The bottom of the \ntoes of the right foot remain on the earth. It is not understood \nfrom his words that you sit between the two prostration‟s as you \nsit in the tashahhud. As for the sitting of the person who prays \nsitting while he recites and bows, it is recommended to be cross-\nlegged. He is silent about where to place the left foot.  Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he puts it under \nhis right thigh. It is said that it is between his thighs. It is said \nthat it is outside. Men and women are the same in that.  \n \nYou remove your hands from the earth and put them on your \nknees. He says in al-Jawhar that he puts his hands near his knees \nwith his fingers level. If he does not lift his hands from the earth, \nthere are two positions about the invalidity of the prayer. The best \nknown is that it is invalid. The soundest, based on what  Shaikh \nal-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, is that it is not invalid. It is \naccepted because this rising from the earth is only recommended \nand not doing something recommended is not one of the things \nwhich invalidate the prayer.  \n \n10.1p Second prostration \n  \nYou then go into sujud again repeating what you did the \nfirst time \n  \nThen after coming up from the first prostration, you prostrate \nagain like the first with the relevant details.  \n \n10.1q Rising from prostration  \n \nThen you stand up again directly from sujud pushing \nyourself up with your hands. You do not go back to the \nsitting position and stand up from there but rather you do \nas I have described. As you stand up you say, \"Allahu \nAkbar.\"  \n \nAfter the second prostration, you stand up as you were without \nsitting. This indicates refutation of the Hanafi position. Abdullah \nibn 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu) said that if he sits and then \nstands, and it is deliberate, he asks Allah azza wa jall's \nforgiveness and does not have to do anything. If he forgets, he \nprostrates after the salam. The one who does it deliberately does \nnot have to prostrate. Not going back to the sitting position \nindicates that it differs from the Shafi'ites who say it is Sunnah \nfor him to rise for the second and fourth rak'ats from a sitting. We \nconsider it meritorious for him to go back to the standing and to \ncome up directly with your hands. You say the takbir during the \nmove because it is recommended to say the takbir when beginning \nactions in the prayer.  \n \n10.1r Recitation in the second rak'at  \n \nYou then recite as much as you did in the first rak'at or a \nlittle less  \n \nAfter the takbir, you recite the Fatiha and a sura. The second \nshould be similar or shorter than the length of the first. Both are \naffirmed. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) follows Shaikh al-\nFakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) in what he recommended is that \nthe first rak'at should be longer than the second. The evidence for \nthat is found in the two Sahih collections where the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) made the first long and the second short. \nWhat is meant is that the first is longer than the second in time, \neven if the recitation in the second is more, but he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) recited slowly in the first. It is recommended that he \nrecites by the order of the Holy Qur'an, and reversal of order is \ndisliked. However, he if inverts the order, there is nothing against \nhim. The disliked reversal is to reverse the suras or recite the last \nhalf a sura and then the first half. It is like that in one or two \nrak'ats. When he does the forbidden reversal, then the prayer is \ninvalid. That is like reversing the order the ayats of the same sura \nin the same rak'at.  \n \nand do the same again  \n \nThis means that you repeat all the previous actions. Then you \nperform the prostration and sitting as was already described.  \n \n10.1s The Qunut  \n \nexcept that (being Subh) you also recite the Qunut after \ndoing ruku' although you can, if you want, recite it before \nruku' after finishing your recitation of the Holy Qur'an  \n \nThe Qunut is done in the second rak'at after coming up from \nruku', although it could be before the ruku', there being a \ndisagreement about whether it is meritorious or Sunnah. If it is \nSunnah and he omits it and he does not prostrate for it, his prayer \nis invalid. If it is meritorious and he prostrates for it, his prayer is \ninvalid if the prostration is before the salam. It appears from the \nwords of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is better after \nruku'. It is the position of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe well-known position is that it is better before ruku' based on \nwhat is in the Sahih that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwas asked whether it was before or after and he replied that it \nwas before. It is also based on kindness to the one who is preceded \nand because that is what 'Umar (radhi’Allahu anhu) continued \nto do in the presence of the Companions.  \n \nThe well-known position is that he does not raise his hands as he \ndoes not raise them in saying \"Amin\" or in the supplication of the \ntashahhud. It is better to do it silently because it is a supplication. \nIf he forgets to do it before ruku', he can do it after it if he \nremembers. He cannot go back from ruku' if he remembers. If he \ndoes go back, then his prayer is invalid because he went back from \nan obligation to something recommended.   \n \n10.2 Qunut  \n \nThe Qunut consists of the words:  \n \nAllahumma innaa nasta'eenuka wa nastaghfiruka wa \nnuuminu bika wa natwakkalu 'alayka wa nakhna'u laka \nwa nakhla'u wa natruku man yakfuruk. Allahumma \niyyaaka na'budu wa laka nusalli wa nasjud. Wa ilayka \nnas'a \nwa \nnahfid. \nNarju \nrahmataka \nwa \nnakhaafu \n'adhaabaka'l-jidd. Inna 'adhaabaka bil-kaafireena mulhiq.  \n \n(O Allah, we seek help from You and ask forgiveness of You \nand believe in You and rely on You. We humble ourselves \nbefore you and renounce all other dins. And we abandon \nall who reject You. O Allah it is You we worship and to You \nthat we pray and prostrate and for You that we strive and \nstruggle. We hope for Your mercy and fear Your certain \npunishment. Your punishment will surely come to those \nwho disbelieve.)  \n \nThis is its chosen expression among the Malikis, although it is \nsaid, \"We rely on you\" is an addition in the Risala. One variant \nhas after it, \"We praise You well.\"  \n \n10.3 The final sitting, tashahhud and salam  \n \n10.3a The final sitting  \n \nThen you do the same regarding your sujud and sitting as \nhas already been described. When you sit back again after \nyour two sajdas you keep your right foot upright with the \ntoes pointing forward and fold your left foot underneath \nwith your left buttock resting on the ground, not on your \nleft foot.  \n \nWhen you finish the Qunut, you go down into prostration \nwithout sitting. You sit between the two prostration’s as \nwas described.  \n \nWhen you sit after the second rak'at for the tashahhud, you have \nyour right foot upright with the toes forward, and the left foot \nfolded underneath, sitting on your left buttock. That is the sound \ntransmission. It is related as \"buttocks\" which it a mistake \nbecause if he sits on them, that it resembles squatting which is \ndisliked, even though it is not actual squatting which is to put the \nbuttocks on the ground and keep the thighs upright and place the \nhands on the ground, as a dog sits. You do not sit on your left foot. \nHe said that in reference to Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) who says that he sits on his left foot. The description which \nhe mentioned resembles that in the Mudawwana in all the sitting \npositions of the prayer.  \n \nAnother foot position  \n \nIf you want, your right foot can be at an angle, with the \nside of the big toe resting on the ground. Both of these \npositions are acceptable  \n \n Without having the foot upright. What the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) mentioned is opposed to Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the bottom of the toes are on the ground and not the \nside. It is preferred. Then you sit for the tashahhud after the two \nprostration‟s of the second rak'at.  \n \n10.3b The tashahhud  \n \nYou then say the tashahhud, which consists of the words: \nat-tahiyyatu Lillah. az-zakiyatu Lillah. at-tayyibatu's-\nsalawatu Lillah. as-salamu 'alayka ayyuha'n-nabiyyu wa \nrahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. assalamu 'alaynâ wa 'ala \n'ibadai'llahi's-salihin. \nash-hadu \nan \nla \nilaha \nill’Allah \nwahdahu la sharikalah. wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan \n'abduhu wa Rasuluh.  \n \n(Greetings are for Allah, Good actions are for Allah. good \nwords and prayers are for Allah. Peace be upon you, O \nProphet, and the mercy of Rasulullah and His blessings. \nPeace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I \nbear witness that there is no god except Allah alone \nwithout partner and I bear witness that Muhammad is His \nslave and His Messenger.)  \n \nThese are the words of the tashahhud preferred by most of the \nMalikis. In the Mudawwana instead of \"Muhammadan 'abduhu\" \nhe has \"Muhammad 'Abdullah\" (Muhammad is the slave of Allah).  \n \n10.3c The salam  \n \nIf you then say the salam at this point, your prayer is valid  \n \ni.e. after saying, \"I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and \nHis Messenger\", the prayer is valid, whether you say part of it or \nleave part, ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, i.e. with either of \nthe two statements or if he says something else. It is not valid to \nsay that it is enough in the form of perfection because he did not \nmention the prayer on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). \nSo the truth is that it a discarded description.  \n \n10.3d Possible Additions  \n \nYou can also add to this, one possibility being:  \n \nwa ash-hadu anna'lladhi jaa'a bihi Muhammadun haqq. wa \nanna'n-naara haqq. wa anna's-saa'ata aatiyatun la rayba \nfihaa. wa anna'llaha yab'athu man fi'l-qubuur.  \n \nAllahumma \nsalli \n'ala \nMuhammadin \nwa \n'alaa \naali \nMuhammadin \nwarham \nMuhammadan \nwa \naala \nMuhammadin wa barik 'ala Muhammadin wa 'ala ali \nMuhammadin kama sallayta wa rahimta wa barakta 'ala \nIbrahima wa 'alaa aali Ibrahima fi'l-'alamîna innaka \nhameedun majeed.  \nAllahumma salli 'alaa malaa-ikatika wa'l-muqarrabeena wa \n'alaa anbiyaa-ika wa'l-mursaleena wa 'ala ahli taa'atika \najma'een.  \nAllahumma'ghfir li wa liwalidaya wa li a'immatina wa \nliman sabbaqanaa bi'l-eemani maghfiratun 'azmaa.  \nAllahumma inni as'aluka min kulli khayrin sa'alaka minhu \nMuhammadun nabiyyuka wa a'udhu bika min kulli sharrin \nista'adhaka minhu Muhammadun nabiyyuka.  \n \nAllahumma'ghfir lana ma qaddamnâ wa ma akharnaa wa \nma asrarnaa wa ma a'lannaa wa ma anta a'lamu bihi \nminhaa.  \n \nRabbanaa aatina fi'd-dunyaa hasanatan wa fi'l-akhirati \nhasanatan wa qina 'adhaaba'n-naar wa a'udhu bika min \nfitna'l-mahya wa'l-mamati wa min fitna'l-qabri wa min \nfitna'l- masîhi'd- dajjali wa min 'adhaabi'n-naari wa su'i'l-\nmaseer.  \n \nAs-salaamu 'alayka ayyuha'n-nabiyyu wa rahmatu'llahi wa \nbarakatuh. As-salaamu 'alaynaa wa 'ala 'ibaadi'llahi's-\nsaaliheen.  \n \n(And I bear witness that what Muhammad brought is true. \nAnd that the Garden is true. And that the Fire is true. And \nthat the Hour is coming and there is no doubt about it. And \nthat Allah will raise up those in the graves.  \nO Allah pray on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad \nand have mercy on Muhammad and the family of \nMuhammad as you prayed on and had mercy on and \nblessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim. In all the \nworlds, You are praiseworthy, glorious.  \n \nO Allah, pray on Your angels and those brought near and \non Your Prophets and Messengers and on all the people \nwho obey You.  \n \nO Allah, forgive me and my parents and our Imams and \nthose who have gone before us with iman with complete \nforgiveness.  \n \nO Allah, I ask You for every good thing that Muhammad, \nYour Prophet, asked You for and I seek refuge in You from \nevery evil that Muhammad, Your Prophet, sought refuge in \nYou from.  \n \nO Allah, forgive us for what we have done and for what we \nhave put off doing, for what we have kept hidden and what \nwe have done openly and for what You have more \nknowledge about than us.  \n \nOur Lord give us good in this world and good in the next \nworld and protect us from the torment of the Fire. I seek \nrefuge in You from the trials of life and death and from the \ntrials of the grave and from the trials of the Dajjal and \nfrom the torment of the Fire and from an evil end.  \n \nPeace be upon you, O Prophet and the mercy of Allah and \nHis blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the right-acting \nslaves of Allah.)  \n \nIt is understood that when he has said the supplication, it is \nrecommended that he does not end with the salam until he has \nasked for peace on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). That \nis necessary for everyone who prays as opposed to the well-known \nposition which is what  Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated: that the salam on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) is not repeated when he makes supplication. Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) recommended it for someone following an \nImam. When the Imam says the salam, he says, \"Peace be upon \nyou, etc.\" This addition is weak. Part of its weakness is that it is \nparticular to the one following the Imam as Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) stated.  \n \n10.3e Saying the Salam  \n \nThen you say, \"As-salamu 'alaikum\" once  \n \nAfter that you say that salam which ends the prayer. This salam \nis obligatory without dispute for every one who prays, Imam, \nindividual, or following an Imam. He only ends the prayer by it. \nSpecifically \nincumbent \nis \nthe \nphrase \nwhich \nthe \nShaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned, by definition and order and in \nthe plural. If he says, \"Upon you peace\" or \"My peace upon you\" or \n\"The peace of Allah on you,\" or he omits the definite article, it is \nnot adequate.  \n \nDoes he require an intention to end the prayer or not? There are \ntwo well-known positions. The predominant, as is seen in the \nwords of Shaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi), is that it is not a \nprecondition, although it is recommended to do it. Indeed, the one \nwho is unable to say the salam of release as a sentence leaves the \nprayer by his intention. Then the intention of ending is obligatory \nand the salam does not remove when he is unable to say part of it.  \n \n10.3f The direction faced in the salam  \n \nstarting to the front and turning to the right a little as you \nsay it. This is what the Imam does or anyone doing the \nprayer by themselves \n  \nThis means you incline your head a little to the right. The \ndescription of the salam differs with the different people praying. \nAn Imam or one praying alone say one salam, facing the front and \na little to the right. He begins by facing is desirable. It is sunnah \nfor anyone who prays to say the taslim aloud. As for the taslim of \nsomeone else, namely someone following the Imam, it is best to \nsay it silently. This applies to the man who has no one with him so \nthat any error might result. \"Saying it out loud\" in the case of a \nwoman is so that she can hear herself.  \n \nIt is recommended for everyone praying to say the takbir al-ihram \naloud, and that is the case for the rest of the takbirs for the Imam \nas opposed to the one who is following, and for the person praying \nalone. It is recommended for the Imam to make the salam and \ntakbir al-ihram short so that the one following does not precede \nhim in them. What is meant is quickness without extension.  \n \nThe Imam and the one praying alone should begin to say it while \nfacing the qibla because they are commanded to face qibla in all \nthe pillars of the prayer, and the salam is one of its pillars, even \nthough he leaves the prayer by it. It is recommended to turn to his \nright side in the course of it. If he says the salam on his left, \nintending to end it, and does not say it to his right, his prayer is \nnot invalid according to the well-known position because he has \nomitted the right, which is meritorious. If the one following says \nthe salam to the left, intending the merit with the intention of \nreturning to the salam of ending, and he believes that the salam \nto the left is meritorious which does not end the prayer, and a long \ntime passes before he returns to the final salam, then his prayer is \ninvalid. If it is not a long time, it is not invalid because the salam \nto the left is for a meritorious action, and is to like extraneous \nspeech before the final salam because when he does it with the \nintention of bringing the final salam after it, he becomes like \nsomeone \nwho \nadvances \nsomething \nmeritorious \nbefore \nan \nobligation.  \n \n10.3g The salam for someone following an Imam  \n \nIf you are doing the prayer behind an Imam you say the \nsalam once, turning a little to the right, then you return \nthe salam of the Imam towards the front  \n \nThe salam of the follower is to say one salam, turning to the right \nfor all of it, as opposed to the Imam and the one praying alone. \nThe difference between him and them is that their salam and \nresponse is considered to be part of the prayer, and so they face \nthe qibla at the beginning like all the actions of the prayer. As for \nthe one following the Imam, his Imam said the salam, and he \nfollows him, so it means that his prayer had ended.  \n \nIt is Sunnah for the one following to say another salam other than \nthe final salam in the direction of the Imam, neither to the right \nnor the left. He indicates him with his heart by agreement.   \n \n10.3h The salam to the left  \n \nthen, if there is anyone on your left who has said the \nsalam, you greet them in return. You do not say the salam \nto the left if no one has said it to you \n  \nIt is Sunnah for the one following the Imam to respond to his left \nif there is anyone on his left. It is evident that he does not say the \nsalam to his left unless there is someone on his left who greets \nhim. If he supposes that he did not greet him, as when he omits \nthe salam, for instance he might suppose that he does greet him, \nbut that is not the case.  \n \nThe position of the necessity of returning the salam to the left by \nthe one following if there is someone on the left and he earns the \nmerit of the group. If there is no one on his left who obtains the \nblessing of the group since there is actually no one there or there \nis someone who comes late and missed a rak'at with the Imam, he \nis not asked to return it. Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"Does the one who comes late who caught the merit of the \ngroup reply to the Imam and to the one who said the salam on the \nleft when he finishes the prayer or not since he has missed its \nplace? There are two transmissions: one is that which Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers and it is accepted is that he \nreplies, even if the person on the left has departed.  \n \n10.3i The position of the tashahhud  \n \nWhile you are saying the tashahhud you put your hands on \nyour thighs, clenching all the fingers of the right hand \nexcept your forefinger which you extend with its side \nuppermost \n  \nIt is recommended in the tashahhud to place the hands on the \nthighs close to the knees. This varies. The fingers of the right \nhand are clenched except for the forefinger. It is extended in \nsupplication and glorification to indicate tauhid and to avert \nShaitan based on what is in Sahih Muslim, \"It drives away \nShaitan and he does not forget as long as he is pointing with his \nfinger.\" You point with its side uppermost. The bottom of the \nfinger is not facing the earth or the reverse.  \n \nWhether or not to move the finger  \n \nThere is some difference of opinion as regards the \nmovement of this finger \n  \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is moved, \nand he is relied on. Others say that he does not move it. Based on \nthe position that it is moved, there are two positions about \nwhether it moved in the entire tashahhud or only in the \ntestimonies because he confines himself to the first in the \nMukhtasar. The literal meaning of the words of Shaikh ibn al-\nHajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that the second is the well-known \none. There is also a question in both statements about whether it \nis moved from right to left or top to bottom.  \n \nHolding it straight  \n \nThere are those who say that by holding it straight you are \nindicating that Allah is one God while those who move it \nsay that doing so repels Shaitan. I think they mean by this \nthat you will be reminded in your prayer by moving your \nfinger of what will prevent you, if Allah azza wa jall wills, \nfrom becoming forgetful and distracted. Your left hand is \nlaid flat on your left thigh and you neither move it nor \npoint with it \n  \nThis means he holds it straight without moving it. The one who \nmoves says that it is to repel Shaitan. The left hand is kept flat, \nand he does not point with it, even if his right hand has been \namputated.  \n \n10.4 Dhikr after prayer  \n \nIt is recommended to do dhikr immediately after the \nprayer. You say 'Subhan’Allah' (Glory be to Allah) thirty-\nthree times, 'Alhamdulillah' (Praise be to Allah) thirty-\nthree times, and 'Allahu Akbar' (Allah is greater) thirty-\nthree times. Then you seal the hundred by saying, 'La ilaha \nill’Allah wahdahu la sharikalah. Lahu'l-mulku wa lahu'l-\nhamdu wa huwa 'ala kulli shay'in qadir.' (There is no god \nbut Allah, alone without partner. His is the kingdom and \nHis is the praise and He is capable of all things.)  \n \nThis is done after the obligatory prayers without being separated \nby the nafila based on what Abu Dawud (radhi’Allahu anhu) \ntransmitted that a man prayed the obligatory prayer and then did \nthe voluntary and 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi’Allahu anhu) \npulled him and made him sit. He said, \"Do not pray the nafila \nprayers straight after the obligatory.\" The Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said to him, 'You are right, Ibn al-Khattab. Allah \nhas made you right. The dhikr is done with the expressions heard \nfrom the Lawgiver.”  \n \nThis is the sound transmission with the omission \"makes lives and \ndies.\" Praise is put before takbir and the reverse is done in the \nsalam and asking permission. That is done to be mindful of what \nis found in the hadith. The like of what is here is in the two Sahih \ncollections. In the Muwatta' is like what is in the chapter of \ngreeting and asking permission. The literal meaning of what he \nsays here is that he says, \"Subhan‟Allah, Alhamdulillah and \nAllahu Akbar\" 33 times in a group. A group prefer it, including \nShaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi). Some prefer that they be \nsaid with each one separate.  \n \n10.4b After Subh  \n \nIt is also recommended, after Subh, to continue to do dhikr \nand ask forgiveness and glorify Allah and make du'a up \nuntil sunrise or near to sunrise, but this is not obligatory  \n \nIt is clear from his words that dhikr is other than asking \nforgiveness, glorification and supplication, Some of them say that \ndhikr is recitation of the Holy Qur'an. Some of them say that \ndhikr is explained by what is after it, so it is as if he were saying \nthat it is asking forgiveness, etc.  \n \nThis lasts until sunrise based on what Shaikh at-Tirmidhi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related and said is hasan. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"If anyone prays Fajr in a group and \nthen sits remembering Allah azza wa jall until sun rises and then \nprays two rak'ats, has a reward similar to that of a completed \nhajj.\" This is what the Salaf did. They persevered in occupying \nthemselves with dhikr after Subh until the end of its time. It is \nnot obligatory, recommended.  \n \n10.4c Fajr  \n \nThere are also the two rak'ats of Fajr which you do before \nSubh after the break of dawn. In each rak'at you recite just \nthe Fatiha silently \n  \nIt is not enough if they are done before dawn, even with only the \ntakbir al-ihram because it is a prayer which is prescribed and is \ndependent on the obligation of Fajr and it is connected to the time \nof that which it follows. Two positions are related about it in the \ngeneral chapter of the obligatory prayers: desirable and Sunnah. \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of al-Mukhtasar follows the first, \nwhich is the accepted position. He must intend them as the two \nrak'ats of Fajr to make them distinct them from the nafila \nprayers. If he prays without that, they are not adequate.  \n \nIn each rak'at it is recommended to only recite the Fatiha silently, \nbased on what is in the Muwatta' and Muslim where 'A'isha \n(radhi’Allahu anha) said, \"The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) used to pray the two rak'ats of Fajr and they were so quick \nthat I would wonder whether he had said the Fatiha in them or \nnot.\" Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) recited the Fatiha and a sura in \nthem from the short ones based on what is in Sahih Muslim that \nafter the Fatiha, the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) recited \nin them al-Kafirun and Ikhlas. It is better to pray them in the \nmasjid.  \n \nIf someone enters the masjid without having prayed them, and the \niqama for the obligatory prayer has been given, he omits them and \njoins the Imam and then prays them after sunrise. Their time \nextends until midday. He does not make up any nafila prayers \nexcept them. Whoever sleeps through Subh until sunrise, prays \nSubh and then prays them afterwards. Whoever forgets them \nuntil he has prayed Subh or the time of Subh has come does not \npray them until sunrise.  \n \n10.5. Dhuhr  \n \n10.5a Recitation in Dhuhr  \n \nYour recitation for Dhuhr should be from suras like the \nones you recite at Subh or a little shorter,  \n \nHis words means that the recitation in Dhuhr is equal is what is \nrecited in Subh, i.e. from the long. That is what Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is \nrecommended that the recitation in Dhuhr be a little less than the \nrecitation in Subh. That is preferred. If, for example, he recited al-\nFath (Holy Qur‟an 48) in Subh, he recites something like al-\nJumu'a (Holy Qur‟an 62) or as-Saff (Holy Qur‟an 61). It is not \nunderstood that he recites the middle mufassal. Shaikh ibn 'Umar \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) considers that the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) imply a third position, which is choice.  \n \n10.5b Out loud \n \nbut at Dhuhr none of the recitation is done out loud. In \nboth the first and the second rak'ats you recite the Fatiha \nand another sura silently and in the last two rak'ats you \nrecite just the Fatiha silently \n  \nRecitation is not out loud in Dhuhr, either the Fatiha nor \nanything else. Reciting the Fatiha in the last two is by way of \nSunnah.   \n \n10.5c Tashahhud  \n \nYou do the tashahhud in the first sitting as far as the \nphrase, 'wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa \nRasuluh.'  \n \nHe adds this.  \n \n105d Takbir for standing  \n \nAfter that you stand up but do not say 'Allahu Akbar' until \nyou are fully upright. This is what someone leading the \nprayer, or someone doing the prayer by themselves, does \n  \nThen after finishing the tashahhud to the point mentioned, he \nrises for the third rak'at, and he does not say the takbir when he \nbegins to stand up, but waits until he is upright according to what \nis known in the school in action and because he has not moved \nfrom a pillar. He has moved from a Sunnah to a fard, and the fard \nis more entitled to the takbir, and because rising for the third is \nlike beginning a new prayer. That is how the Imam and person \npraying alone does it.  \n \n10.5e Standing when following the Imam  \n \nIf you are doing the prayer behind an Imam you stand up \nafter the Imam has said, 'Allahu Akbar', and, when you are \nfully upright, you say, 'Allahu Akbar' \n  \nIf you are following an Imam, you only stand up after the Imam \nhas said, \"Allahu Akbar\" and has finished it. When you are \nupright, then you follow the Imam, and imitate it. All his actions \ncome after the Imam's actions. In the hadith, \"Do not precede me \nin bowing or prostrating.\" This tells us that the one following the \nImam follows him because the prohibition against going ahead of \nhim demands following. It negates getting ahead and doing at the \nsame time.  \n \nApart from that, the rest of the prayer, in terms of the \nruku', sujud and sitting, is the same as has been mentioned \nfor Subh \n  \nThe rest of the prayer is the same as that for Subh. The proof of \nthat is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it and \ntaught people. There is no difference in what was mentioned \nbetween him doing it and teaching people.  \n \n10.5f Nafila prayers after Dhuhr  \n \nIt is recommended to pray four nafila rak'ats after Dhuhr, \nsaying the salam after each two rak'ats \n  \nThis is because of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"If anyone perseveres in the four rak'ats before Dhuhr and four \nafter them, Allah azza wa jall will forbid him to the Fire,\" i.e. \npersevering in what was mentioned is a reason for not committing \na major wrong action. Then his body will be forbidden to the Fire. \nThe hadith is related by Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nthe people of the Sunan, i.e. Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), Shaikh an-Nasa‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn Majah \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Abu Dawud(rahmatullahi \nalaihi). If you said that since it is encouraged to persevere with \nfour before and four after, why does the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) confine it to the four afterwards, I said that it is to point \nout the difference between it and 'Asr where he only does nafila \nbefore it. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it.  \n \n10.6 'Asr  \n \n10.6a Nafila before 'Asr  \n \nIt is also recommended to do the same before 'Asr \n  \nHe should do four rak'ats before 'Asr since it is confirmed that he \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"May Allah azza wa jall show mercy \non a man who prays four rak'ats before 'Asr\" which has the senses \nof, \"O Prophet, show mercy.\" There is no doubt that his \nsupplication is answered.  \n \n10.6b Recitation in 'Asr  \n \n \nFor 'Asr you do exactly the same as we have detailed for \nDhuhr except that in the first two rak'ats, after reciting \nthe Fatiha, you recite one of the short suras such as \"Wa'd-\nduha\" (93) or \"Innaa anzalnaahu\". (97)  \n \nYou do 'Asr like Dhuhr except that you use shorter suras. So if you \nbegin it with one of the long sura, you should leave it and recite a \nshort sura.  \n \n10.7 Maghrib  \n \n10.7a Recitation in Maghrib  \n \nFor Maghrib you do the recitation out loud in the first two \nrak'ats, in each rak'at reciting the Fatiha and one of the \nshort suras. In the third rak'at you recite the Fatiha on its \nown and do the tashahhud and say the salam \n  \nThe third rak'at is done silently. The 'amal is that short suras are \nused. What is transmitted to the contrary is, interpreted, i.e. \nShaikh \nan-Nasa‟i \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nAbu \nDawud \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) transmitted that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) used to recite al-A'raf (Holy Qur‟an 7) in Maghrib. \nSo it is interpreted that it is possible that he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) knew that those behind him would not be harmed by that. \nOtherwise, he would have continued on an easier action.  \n \nYou only recite the Fatiha in the third. After it, you do the \ntashahhud and prayer on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nand make supplication after that and say the salam.  \n \n10.7b Nafila prayers  \n \nIt is recommended to do two nafila rak'ats after Maghrib \nand if you do more than this, that is good. Six rak'ats are \nspecifically recommended \n  \nHe stressed the recommendation to pray two rak'ats after \nfinishing \nMaghrib \nand \nmore \nis \ngood. \nEvidence \nfor \nits \nrecommendation lies in the fact that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did it. What is more than two is good since He says, \n\"Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it.\" Six are \nrecommended since he (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"If anyone \nprays six rak'ats after Maghrib in which he does not say anything \nevil [i.e. haram] between them, that is equal to the worship of \ntwelve years.\" Shaikh ibn Khuzayma (rahmatullahi alaihi) related \nit in his Sahih as did Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThat which is in at-Tata'i from the Sahih of Shaikh ibn Khuzayma \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that they are equal to the worship. One of \nthem said, \"To the worship of the Banu Israel\". In the Collections \nof Shaikh at-Tabarani (rahmatullahi alaihi), \"If anyone prays six \nafter Maghrib he will be forgiven his wrong actions, even if they \nare like the froth of the sea.\"  \n \n10.7c Nafila between Maghrib and 'Isha'  \n \nDoing rak'ats in the time between Maghrib and 'Isha is also \nstrongly recommended \n  \nImam al-Ghazali (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was asked about the words of the \nAlmighty, \"Their sides avoid the beds,\" and said that it is praying \nbetween Maghrib and 'Isha'. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"You must pray between Maghrib and 'Isha', It \nremoves vanities,\" i.e. it expels what someone has disliked, words \nor actions so that he is not criticized for it nor is he moved to a \nforbidden action or from a small sin to a great one which only \nrepentance of Allah azza wa jall's pardon expiates.  \n \n10.7d Other aspects of Maghrib  \n \nAs for the other aspects of Maghrib, they are the same as \nhas already been mentioned regarding the other prayers \n  \nThis is to have the recitation out loud in the first two with the \nFatiha and a short sura, and only the Fatiha silently in the third.  \n \n10.8 'Isha'  \n \n10.8a Recitation in 'Isha'  \n \nFor the last prayer, 'Isha - which is also known as al-\n'Atama although the name 'Isha is more appropriate -you \npray the first two rak'ats out loud, reciting in both of them \nthe Fatiha and another sura. The suras chosen should be a \nlittle longer than those chosen for 'Asr. In each of the last \ntwo rak'ats you recite the Fatiha to yourself. The other \nparts of the prayer are done as has already been described \n  \nRecitation in the 'Isha' prayer is longer than 'Asr. In the last two \nrak'ats, he recites only the Fatiha.  \n \n10.8b Sleeping before 'Isha'  \n \nSleeping before 'Isha is disliked, as is talking after it unless \nthere is a special need to do so \n  \nIt is not disliked to talk after its time has come and before it has \nnot been prayed. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat. It is also disliked to sit up without conversation out of the \nfear of missing Subh and rising at night.  \n \n10.9 Volume of Recitation  \n \n10.9a What is meant by 'reciting to yourself'  \n \nThe expression 'reciting to yourself' as far as the prayers \nare concerned means moving the tongue as you articulate \nthe words of the Holy Qur'an. The expression 'reciting out \nloud' means, if you are doing the prayer alone, that you \nrecite loud enough for yourself and anyone standing close \nto you to hear \n  \nThis is the least of doing it silently and the most is that he only \ncan hear himself. By moving his tongue, he is careful more \nreciting in the prayer with his heart. It is not enough. So if he \nwere to take an oath that he would not recite the Holy Qur'an and \nthen made it flow in his heart, he does not break the oath of not \nreciting.  \n \nThe minimum of out loud in the obligation is that someone can \nhear it and its maximum has no limit. Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Look at the meaning of his words, \"if \nhe is alone.\" It is clear that it is not for the Imam who should \nmake it heard by himself to hear himself and those behind him. If \nthe one behind him does not hear him, his prayer is valid. The \nSunnah is achieved by the one next to him hearing. Shaikh al-\nAqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if he is alone. he \nconsiders the one near him to be another persons praying, and so \nhis principle in being out loud is that of a woman.  \n \nThe place where the out loud is demanded, as in the commentary \nof Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi), is when it does not entail \nconfusing someone else. Otherwise that which will result in \nconfusion is forbidden, even if it leads to making the Sunnah fall \nbecause he does not commit anything unlawful to obtain the \nSunnah.  \n \n10.10 Women's Prayer \n \n10.10a Women's recitation  \n \nWomen's recitation in the Holy Qur'an should be quieter \nthan that of men \n  \nThe woman is quieter than man so that only she can hear herself, \nlike the talbiyya. The loudest of her loud and quiet recitation of it \nis the same, and it is that only that she can hear herself. \nAccording to this, she is the same silently and aloud, i.e. the silent \nis not lower than that which is done with the movement of the \ntongue, i.e. with how a man recites silently.  \n \n10.10b Difference from men's prayer  \n \nOtherwise they do the prayer in the same way as men \nexcept that they should keep their legs together and their \narms close to their sides and keep themselves as gathered \nas possible when sitting and in sujud and in the whole of \nthe prayer in general \n  \nShe is like the man in the prayer except that she keeps her legs \ntogether and arms close in. She does this out of fear of breaking \nwind because she is not like the man in retention. She has a \ncertain looseness. If her legs were apart, she might break wind \nwhich would break wudu'. This is also true of ruku' and she does \nnot put her arms out like a man. What the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) mentioned is the transmission of Shaikh ibn Ziyad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwhich is contrary to the statement of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-Mudawwana because he considers the \nman and woman the same in the form. That which the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned from the transmission of Shaikh \nibn Ziyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) is preferred and the words of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) are weak.  \n \n10.11 The Witr and nafila prayers at night  \n \n10.11a The Shaf'i and Witr  \n \nThen you pray the Shaf'i (even) and Witr (odd) out loud \n  \nAfter 'Isha', you pray the shaf'i prayer which is two rak'ats. There \nare positions about whether it a precondition that it have a \nspecific intention or whether any two rak'ats enough. The evident \none is the second based on that fact that it is valid that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The prayer at night is in \nones and twos. When one of you fears the approach of Subh \nprayer, he should pray the one rak'at of the witr to make odd what \nhe prayed\". After the two rak'ats, he prays the witr. It is a \nconfirmed Sunnah in the famous position. It is said that it is \nobligatory and that it is the most confirmed of the Sunnah‟s. It is a \nstronger Sunnah than the „Id, and stronger than the Eclipse and \nRain prayers. The two rak'ats of tawaf are stronger than the witr. \nAs for the funeral prayer, it is less than the witr and more than \nthe „Id. Shaikh Abdu'l-Baqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) demonstrated \nthat the funeral is more confirmed than the witr.  \n \nIn the best position it is a single rak'at after the shaf'i. The place \nof its excellence is after the shaf'i. There are two statements about \nwhether the shaf‟i is a precondition of completeness or a \nprecondition of validity. The first is taken by the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) of al-Jawhar and Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) clearly \nstated that it is well-known. The second is that he does a witr \nwithout the shaf‟i. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that \nhe repeats his witr after the shaf'i as long as he has not prayed \nSubh, i.e. by way of Sunnah. When we say that the shaf‟i must be \nput first it means its being before it is a precondition of validity. It \nmust be connected to the witr. A small gap is permitted. There are \ntwo positions about whether a long gap is permitted.  \n \n10.11b Night nafila prayers  \n \nIn the same way it is recommended to do nafila prayers at \nnight out loud whereas nafila prayers during the day \nshould be done to yourself although if you say them out \nloud during the day it is still acceptable \n  \nThis means it is permitted. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) related to statements about it being disliked.  \n \n10.11c Number of rak'ats for shaf'i  \n \nThe least number of rak'ats you can do for the shaf'i is two \n  \nThere is no limit to its maximum.  \n \n10.11d Recitation in the shafi'  \n \nIt is recommended that you recite the Fatiha and Sura al-\nA'la (87) in the first rak'at and the Fatiha and Surat al-\nKafirun (109) in the second followed by the tashahhud and \nthe salam \n  \nAfter the salam, you stand for the witr. It is recommended that \nthey be separated by a salam based on the previous hadith and \nthe Maliki Madhhab.  \n \n10.11e Recitation in the Witr  \n \nYou then pray the single rak'at of witr, reciting in it the \nFatiha, Surat al-Ikhlas and the two suras of protection. \n[113 and 114.] If you do more than one pair of rak'ats for \nthe Shaf'i you do the Witr at the end \n  \nThis recitation is recommended. Qadi ibn al-'Arabi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the one who strives recites in it the end of his \nhizb and others recite Ikhlas. The accepted position which the \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned is based on what Abu \nDawud (radhi’Allahu anhu) and others related. 'A'isha \n(radhi’Allahu anha) was asked what the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) recited in the witr. She said, \"He used to recite al-\nA'la in the first, al-Kafirun in the second and Ikhlas and the suras \nof protection in the third. It is clear that this answer does not \nconform to the literal words of the question because it literally was \nwhether he did the witr with three or something else. So perhaps \nshe understood that the asker meant what the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) recited in his witr.  \n \n10.11f The night prayers of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to pray twelve \nrak'ats at night making the number odd by praying one \nrak'at at the end. It is also said that he did twenty rak'ats \nmaking the number odd by adding one rak'at at the end  \n \nThere are sound transmissions in the Sahih, i.e. from the hadith \nof 'A'isha (radhi’Allahu anha) and there is no contradiction \nbetween the transmission of 12 rak'ats and that of 11 rak'ats \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to begin his \nprayer with two quick rak'ats after wudu' and sometimes they \nwere considered part of his devotions. So sometimes she reported \n12 and sometimes did not because they were connected to wudu' \nand the release of the knot of Shaitan, and so she reported ten \nrak'ats. Standing at night or tahajjud was an obligation in respect \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and recommended for \nus since he said, \"You should stand at night. It is the habit of the \nrighteous before you and an act of nearness for your Lord and an \nexpiation of evil deeds and prevents wrong actions.  \n \n10.11g Best time  \n \nThe best time for doing night prayers is the last part of the \nnight \n  \nThis is for the sake of tahajjud according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and his followers based on what is in the two \nSahih collections where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsays, \"Our Lord descends every night to the lower heaven when a \nthird of the night remains. He says, 'Is there any who calls on Me \nso that I can answer him? Who asks of Me so that I can give to \nhim? Who asks My forgiveness so that I can forgive him?\" Imam \nash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) singled out the middle of the \nnight by the report that the Prophet Da'ud (alaihi salam) used to \nsleep half the night and stand in prayer for a third of it and then \nsleep a sixth. Then it is established that the end of the night is \nbetter.  \n \n10.11h Delaying night prayers  \n \nFor this reason it is better to delay your nafila night \nprayers and your Witr until the last part of the night. \nHowever, if you are someone who does not usually wake up \nin time you should do your Witr, along with any nafila \nprayers you want to do, at the beginning of the night  \n \nThis is based on what is in Muslim and elsewhere from the marfu' \nhadith of Jabir (radhi’Allahu anhu): \"Anyone who is afraid that \nhe will not get up at the end of the night should do his witr at its \nbeginning. Anyone who intends to get up at the end of night, \nshould do the witr at its end. The prayer at the end of the night is \nwitnessed\" i.e. the angels of mercy attend it. The upshot is that it \nis recommended to delay the witr in two cases if it is his custom to \nwake up at the end of the night or whether he does or does not is \nequal. It is prayed before in one case. which is when he usually \nsleeps until Subh.  \n \n10.11i Prayers after the Witr  \n \nand then if you do wake up in the last part of the night you \ncan do whatever nafila prayers you want to in pairs, but \nyou do not repeat the Witr \n  \nIf someone does not usually awake up and does his witr before and \nhis nafila as is best for him, and then he later wakes at the end of \nthe night, he can do whatever nafila he wishes because the fact \nthat he has already done the witr does not keep him from \nbeginning prayers after it. However the place of that is when he \nhas the intention of nafila after the witr or during it, not that it \nhappens before he begins the witr. If he intends to do nafila after \nthe witr, that is not permitted. Indeed it is disliked. The best is for \nthe nafila to be in pairs of two rak'ats based on the hadith about \nthe night prayer being in twos. Then when he finishes his nafila, \nhe does not repeat the witr since doing it after 'Isha' was valid and \nit is feared that it is disliked for him to repeat the witr since the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There are not two \nwitrs in the night,\" as Abu Dawud (radhi’Allahu anhu) and \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted it.  \n \n10.11j Oversleeping  \n \nIf you normally pray at the end of the night but oversleep, \nyou can still do your night prayers overlapping the time of \nFajr up to when it begins to get light \n  \nConnected to oversleeping is the one who becomes unconscious, \ninsane, or menstruates and then the excuse disappears at dawn. \nHe did not deliberately delay it and so he does not have to pray it, \neven if he is able to do it with Fajr and Subh before it gets light. \nHe is permitted to do it between dawn and light. The precondition \nfor doing it is that he does not fear that it will get light and that \nhe slept through it by being overcome and that he does not fear \nmissing the group. If he lacks its precondition, he omits it and \nprays Subh without the shaf'i and witr because they are done after \nFajr without any precondition.  \n \nWhen someone sleeps through his normal prayers until after Fajr, \nhe does the witr because it has two times, ikhtiyari which is after \nthe 'Isha' prayer until dawn, and a daruri time from dawn until he \nprays Subh according to the well-known position by the one who \nsays that the witr is not prayed after dawn.  \n \n10.11k Praying witr late  \n \nThen you pray your Witr and do Subh \n  \nIf he prays Subh and omits witr, he prays it after the time of the \nnafila. This is if there is enough time for three rak'ats. If there is \nonly enough time for two rak'ats, he leaves the witr and prays \nSubh in the well-known position. Opposite it is the statement of \nShaikh Asbagh (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he prays the witr as one \nrak'at and one rak'at of Subh before the sun. If there is only \nenough time for one rak'at, then Subh is incumbent by agreement. \nIf there is enough time for five or six, he prays the Shaf'i and witr \nand Subh and omits Fajr. If it is ample enough for seven, he prays \nall.  \n \n10.11l Witr after Subh  \n \nIf you remember that you have not prayed Witr after you \nhave done Subh you do not make it up \n  \nThe like of it is in the Muwatta' from a group of Companions. If he \nforgets the witr and remembers it in the Subh prayer, it is \nrecommended that he step in the famous view if he is alone and \nthen pray the witr and then start the Subh prayer again, i.e. after \nhe repeats the Fajr after the witr. It is even more so if he \nremembers the witr after the Fajr prayer and before beginning \nSubh. So he prays the witr and then repeats Fajr. It is the same if \nhe has prayed Fajr and then remembers an obligatory prayer \nbefore Subh, it is few. Then he repeats Fajr after he has prayed \nthe missed prayer. If he is following an Imam, it is recommended \nthat he continue, even if he is certain that if he stops the prayer \nand prays the witr, he will catch the excellence of the group. There \nare two transmissions about the Imam. One is that he stops and \nthe other that he does not. According to the position that he stops, \ndoes he appoint a deputy based on an analogy with minor \nimpurity or does he not do so based on analogy of what was \nmentioned of a prayer in a prayer. According to the statement that \nhe does not appoint a deputy, does the one following stop or not? \nHe appoints and they complete their prayer. This disagreement \nabout stopping or continuing is when the time is ample. If the \ntime is short, he continues without disagreement.  \n \n10.12 Entering the Masjid  \n \n10.12a Two rak'ats  \n \nIf you are in wudu' when you go into a masjid you should \nnot sit down until you have prayed two rak'ats  \n \nWhen you enter a masjid, it is disliked to sit before praying and \nthis is not eliminated by the fact of sitting. If he enters often, then \nthe first is enough for him if he returns to the masjid soon by \ncustom. Otherwise he should do it again.  \n \nThese two are a greeting for the masjid which is meritorious and \nis accepted. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat they are Sunnah. The basis for this is the words of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"When one of you enters the \nmasjid, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak'ats.\" \n(Sahih Muslim in the form of a prohibition) Sahih al-Bukhari has \nit, \"When one of you enters the masjid, he should do two rak'ats \nbefore he sits, by way of command. This command is by way of \nmeritorious action, not by obligation, and the prohibition is dislike \nand not prohibition.  \n \nThere is no difference in the command to greet the masjid on the \nFriday masjid or others except the masjid of Makka. In it he \nbegins with the tawaf when it is demanded of him, even if by \nrecommendation or it is desirable for someone coming from \noutside to do them first or who does not intend it. If he is in \nMakka and does not have to do tawaf and does not desire it, but \nhe enters it for the prayer or to visit the House and greets it with \ntwo rak‟ats if it is the time in which the nafila is allowed. \nOtherwise, he sits like in any other masjid. An exception is also \nthe masjid of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) according \nto one of two statements of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that \nhe begins with the greeting to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) before beginning to bow and the other is that he begins \nwith ruku' and Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrecommends it and he is relied on because the greeting is the right \nof Allah azza wa jall and the greeting is a human right and the \nfirst is more confirmed.  \n \n10.12b The time  \n \nprovided it is at a time when you are allowed to pray \n  \nA precondition for greeting the masjid is that it is a time in which \nprayer is permitted. If a prohibited time has begun, like sunrise \nand sunset, the khutba for Jumu'a, after 'Asr and after Fajr, then \nit is obligatory that he does not pray in sunrise, sunset and the \nkhutba, and desirable that he not pray after 'Asr and Fajr. If he \nbegins the prayer in a prohibited time, then it is obligatory to stop \nand it is recommended in a disliked time.  \n \nIt is recommended for the one who is not permitted to greet \nbecause of the prior impediments to say four times, \"Glory be to \nAllah and praise belongs to Allah. There is no god but Allah and \nAllah is greater\" and he performs the greeting with the fard \nprayer or, which is better, with a Sunnah or desirable prayer. He \nobtains the reward if he intends the greeting and the fard.  \n \n10.12c Fajr taking their place  \n \nIf you go into the masjid before you have done the two \nrak'ats of Fajr they take the place of those two rak'ats. If \nyou have already prayed the two rak'ats of Fajr before you \ngo to the masjid, there is a difference of opinion about \nwhat you should do. Some people say you pray two rak'ats \nand some people say you do not \n  \nIn such a case, the two rak'ats of Fajr suffice for the greeting of \nthe masjid and he does not pray the two rak'ats of greeting the \nmasjid before it. That is accepted position. It is also said that he \nprays them, but that is weak. If you said that time does not \ndemand the greeting and satisfying the thing is a branch of \ndemanding it, I said that this is based on the position that the \ngreeting is demanded at this time. If you pray them at home and \nthen go to the masjid and find that the iqama for the prayer has \nnot been given, there is disagreement about someone who prays \nthe Sunnah of Fajr outside it. It is said that he prays two rak'ats \nand some say that the sits down before praying, and that is \naccepted.  \n \n10.12d No nafila prayers between dawn and sunrise  \n \nBetween the break of dawn and sunrise there are no nafila \nprayers except the two rak'ats of Fajr \n  \ni.e. and the regular prayers of the one who slept through them as \nwas stated, the shaf'i and the witr absolutely, the funeral for the \none it is not feared will putrefy, and the prostration of recitation \nare done before brightening, and so doing them in that time is \ndisliked. When you fear the corpse will putrefy, it is no unlawful \nto pray over him at the time of prohibition and it is not disliked at \nthe disliked time. When he fears that the corpse will putrefy and \nprays over it at the time of prohibition or dislike, the prayer over \nhim is not repeated when it is permitted, whether he is buried or \nnot. It is like that in the prohibited time if he is buried. Otherwise \nit is repeated.  \n \nWhen the sun begins to rise, nafila are forbidden, including the \nfuneral, the prostration of recitation and vowed nafila to preserve \nthe root until it has fully risen, and the dislike lasts until it has \nrisen the length of a spear from the spears which are measured as \n12 spans.  \n \n \n \nChapter Eleven: the Function of the Imam \n \n \n11.1 The office of Imam  \n \nOn leading the prayer and judgments concerning the Imam \nand those who pray behind an Imam  \n \nThis chapter clarifies who is the best person to be the Imam and \nwho it is disliked to have as Imam. When someone prays alone, \nthat takes the place of the group. It also clarifies one who joins \nalone on the night of rain. The judgment of the one following is \nthat he recites with the Imam when it is silent and he stands at \nthe right of the Imam when he is alone.  \n \n11.1a The best one to be Imam  \n \nThe man who should lead a group of people in prayer is the \nbest and most knowledgeable one among them \n  \nThe one who leads them is the one with the greatest virtue, i.e. if \na group gather, and all are excellent and one is more so, he is the \none who is entitled to be Imam. It is said that the amount of \nknowledge has to do with the excellence.  \n \n11.1b Women cannot be Imams  \n \nWomen cannot lead the prayer. This is the case whether \nthe prayer is fard or nafila and whether the group in \nquestion are men or women \n  \nAs the woman does not lead the prayer, neither does the \nhermaphrodite. If either of them lead the prayer, the prayer must \nalways be repeated according to the Maliki Madhhab whether \nthose following are like them or not. Their own prayers are valid, \neven if they intend to be the Imams. Abu Ibrahim al-Andalusi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) disagrees with that and says, \"Any woman \nor a hermaphrodite like her who resembles a woman who leads a \nprayer must repeat it within the time. Know that actually being a \nmale is a precondition for the validity of being an Imam.   \n \n11.1c Non-Muslims cannot be Imams  \n \nIn addition to this precondition, there is another precondition, \nwhich is being a Muslim. The Imamate of an unbeliever is not \nvalid.  \n \n11.1d Imams must be adults  \n \nAlso maturity is a precondition and it is not valid for a child to be \nthe Imam of an adult in the obligatory prayer because the child is \ndoing nafila and nafila does not make someone following in a fard \nprayer valid. \n \n11.1e Imams must be sane  \n \nAnother precondition is sanity. The Imamate of a madman is not \nvalid.  \n \n11.1f The Imam must know the prayer and be upright  \n \nAnother precondition is knowledge. The prayer is not valid except \nlead by someone with recitation, fiqh, uprightness and the ability \nto perform the pillars of the prayer. The one who is ignorant of \nrecitation or fiqh cannot validly lead in prayer someone who has \nknowledge. As for someone who is illiterate like him, that is valid \nwhen there is no one present who can read.  \n \n11.1g The Imam must have good character  \n \nBy good character is meant lack of impiety connected to the \nprayer. The impiety in the person who is impious towards it is \nsomeone who intends to be an Imam through pride and so his \nImamate is not valid. As for the impiety of the limb, like the \nfornicator, it is disliked for him to be the Imam but his prayer is \nvalid as opposed to what is followed by the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) of al-Mukhtasar that it is invalid by such an impious \nperson.  \n \n11.1h Ability  \n \nSimilarly invalid is the Imamate of the one who is unable to \nperform some of the pillars of the prayer which are fard for the \none who is able to.   \n \n11.1i Congruence  \n \nThere must be congruence in the one followed, i.e. the person, \nplace and time. Doing dhuhr behind someone doing 'Asr is not \nvalid nor the reverse, nor performing a prayer behind someone \nmaking one up or the reverse, nor Dhuhr of Saturday behind \nDhuhr of Sunday nor the reverse.   \n \n11.1j Agreement of madhhab  \n \nThe agreement of the school of the one following with the Imam in \nobligatory parts. So it is not valid to follow someone who omits the \nrecitation in the last two or fails to rise from ruku' or prostration, \nfor instance, and residence and freedom in Jumu'a. So the \nImamate of the traveler is not valid except when he is the khalif. \nWhat is meant by a traveler is the one outside of the land of the \nJumu'a by a farsang. The Imamate of a slave on Jumu'a is not \nvalid, and the Jumu'a must be repeated if that is possible.  \n \n11.1k Reciting with the Imam  \n \nPeople \npraying \nbehind \nan \nImam \nshould \nrecite \nto \nthemselves when he recites to himself  \n \nIt is related that this means that the judgment of the one \nfollowing the Imam is that it is recommended for him to recite \nwith the Imam in what the Imam says silently. That is since lack \nof recitation is a means to thinking and whispering.  \n \n11.1l When the Imam recites aloud  \n \nbut should not recite with him when he recites out loud \n  \nIt is disliked to recite when he recites out loud, even if he cannot \nhear his voice, according to the text. If he recites with him, what \nhe has done is bad, but his prayer is not invalidated. The basis for \nthis is the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"When the Qur'an is \nrecited, then listen to it and be silent.\" Shaikh al-Bayhaqi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported from Mujahid (radhi’Allahu \nanhu) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was reciting \nin the prayer and he heard one of the Ansar reciting, and then the \nwords of Allah azza wa jall were revealed: \"When the Qur'an is \nrecited, then listen to it and be silent.\" They related it from \nMujahid (radhi’Allahu anhu) from another path that he said it \nwas during the khutba on Friday, and another path has the \nprayer and the khutba.  \n \n11.2 Late-comer making up missed prayer  \n \n11.2a Catching the prayer  \n \nIf you catch one or more rak'ats of a group prayer then it is \nas if you have caught the whole prayer \n  \nIf you catch one or more rak'ats of the obligatory prayer or another \nprayer prescribed in a group like the „Ids, with the Imam, is \njudged to have caught the prayer. The Muwatta' has the words of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \"Whoever catches a \nrak'at of the prayer had caught the prayer,\" i.e. he is obliged what \nis obliged of the Imam in the prostration of forgetfulness. He does \nnot follow anyone else nor repeat his prayer in another group. He \nsays the salam to the Imam and to the one of his left and he \nobtains a reward similar to the reward of those who were present \nfrom its beginning. It is 27 degrees higher. This is when he misses \nthe rest of it by necessity, not from choice. Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he obtains the excellence of the \ngroup. It is the literal meaning of the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and agrees with its explanation.  \n \nWhat we said indicates catching one rak'at of the ikhtiyari time is \nin the position of catching all the prayer in negating the sin, even \nif he delays the ikhtiyari. Also no one said that one who misses \npart of the prayer with the Imam repeats it to obtain the benefits \nof the group. This is clear in the rest of his words. “Catching the \nrak'at with the Imam\" is by placing the hands on the knees, \nmeaning he bows over so that if he wanted to place his hands on \nhis knees, he could certainly do that and the Imam would not rise \nfrom ruku' before he placed his hands on his knees.  \n \nThe judgment of the one who misses a rak'at or more with the \nImam is that he performs what he missed with the Imam.  \n \n11.2b Making up the missed recitation  \n \nYou then make up the rak'ats you have missed after the \nImam has said the salam, making your recitation in them \nout loud or silent in the way that the Imam did \n  \nWhat the Imam recited of the Fatiha and the sura, he recites as \nthe Imam recited: what he did silently he does silently and what \nhe did out loud, he does out loud. If he sits in the place, he is \npermitted to sit, even if he is alone, by catching two rak'ats, then \nhe stands with a takbir. If he sits in a place where it is not \npermitted to sit, even if alone, by catching one or three rak'ats \nwith him, he stands without a takbir. It is the famous position as \nopposed to Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is as \nhe thought that the takbir is for moving to a pillar of the prayer. \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of at-Tiraz mentioned from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-'Utibiyya the position that \nif he sits in the second, he stands without a takbir. He said that it \nis based on the fact that he is making up the two previous ones \nand that which begins the first is the takbir al-ihram.  \n \n11.2c Making up other actions  \n \nThe other aspects of the prayer such as your standing and \nsitting are done as if you were continuing a prayer you had \nstarted by yourself \n  \nHe builds on what he has done. He prays like someone who prays \nuntil the end of his prayer and then remembers that he has \nmissed some of the prayer. This has three forms because he either \nremembers what would invalidate one, two or three rak'ats by \nomitting prostration, recitation of the Fatiha or something else \nwhich would invalidate the prayer.  \n \n11.3 Repeating the Prayer  \n \nIf you have already done the prayer by yourself you can do \nit again with a group in order to get the benefit there is in \ndoing that  \n \n If you have prayed the obligatory prayer alone outside one of the \nthree masjids (Makka, Madina and al-Aqsa), where there is no \nregular Imam and the Iqama was not given while you were in the \nmasjid, it is recommended that you repeat what he prayed in the \ngroup, even in the daruri time. The repeating is for the sake of the \nexcellence of the group which is limited by not being outside of the \ntime of the prayer. If it is outside of the time of the prayer, it is not \nrepeated.  \n \nThe group consists of two and more, and so there is no repeating \nwith one until he is a regular Imam.  \n \nIf the iqama of the prayer is called while someone is in the masjid, \nhe joins it. The Mudawwana states: \"If anyone hears the iqama \nand has already prayed alone, it is not obligatory for him to repeat \nit unless he wishes, even if he is in a masjid which he has entered \nwith the Imam. The intention of the one who has prayed alone \nwho repeats it in the group is to obtain the excellence reported in \nthat by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The group \nprayer is 27 degrees better than the pray alone.\" The prayer which \nis repeated for the excellence of the group is general in every \nobligatory prayer.  \n \n11.3b The case of Maghrib  \n \nexcept in the case of Maghrib \n  \nIf he were to repeat it with the Imam, he bows an even number, \nand does it as nafila. If he does not remember until he has prayed \nthree with him, when the Imam says the salam, he does a fourth \nafter it as nafila. If he does not remember until he has prayed \nwith the Imam, he does not repeat it. It is also said that he does \nnot repeat it. He is not asked to repeat Maghrib for the group \nbecause if it is repeated, it becomes even. Maghrib is three so that \nthe number of rak'ats of the day and night will be odd. According \nto the words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi), he repeats Isha', \neven if he has done the witr. The well-known position is that it is \nnot repeated if he has done the witr for the joining of the two witrs \nin the night according to one of two statements by Shaikh Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he repeats the witr when he repeats \n'Isha'.  \n \n11.3c Only one group prayer  \n \nIf you have caught one rak'at or more of a group prayer \nthen you should not do that prayer again with another \ngroup \n  \n i.e. it is forbidden for him, even if the second group is greater in \nnumber that more excellent. It is the well-known position, i.e. \nbecause the excellence for which repeating is prescribed has been \nobtained, even if the prayer begins with the excellent, and the \nlarge group is better. However, this excellence is not prescribed for \nthe sake of repetition. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"The excellence of the group is have number and the \nexcellence of the Imam is based on what is stated by the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The prayer of a man with \nanother man is better than his prayer alone, and his prayer with \ntwo men is better than his prayer with one man, and what is more \nis more beloved to Allah azza wa jall,\" i.e. wherever he is, that is \nthe case. So this would mean whoever prays with a group should \nrepeat it with a better group, or the one who prayed with an Imam \nshould repeat it with a better Imam. This is not what is meant \nand it is not what is meant in the hadith. This hadith indicates \nthe encouragement to pray in a group or in large group. Then the \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) explains what is understood by his \nwords, to make it clearer.  \n \n11.3d When it is allowed  \n \nBut if you have only caught the sujud or the tashahhud \nthen you can, if you want, do that prayer again with \nanother group \n  \nHe can choose between two things: either building on his ihram or \nstopping and joining another group if he hopes to catch it. If he \ndoes not hope to catch it, then he completes his prayer and does \nnot stop it. This is in respect of the one who has not prayed before \nthat. As for the one who has prayed before that, and not caught \nthe group prayer except for this amount, he does two, i.e. it is \ndesirable after the salam of the Imam. He does two when the \nprayer is one after which nafila is permitted, as in at-Tata'i. \nAccording to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), he \nabsolutely stops, whether he began the prayer with the intention \nof the fard or nafila, i.e. after the two rakat‟s, and does not \ncomplete his prayer.  \n \nOpposite that is what Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in \nal-Mabsut about his intention when he joined the Imam was to \nmake it Dhuhr with four and his prayer at home nafila, then he \nmust complete it and it is up to Allah azza wa jall to make the \nfard whichever of them He wishes. If he does not mean to negate \nthe first, then the first is adequate and he does not have to \ncomplete this one.  \n \n11.4 Positions behind an Imam  \n \nThen there are six positions regarding someone following the \nImam regarding whether he is alone, or other men or women are \nwith him. \n  \n11.4a Two men  \n \nIf there is just one man with the Imam he stands on the \nImam's right \n  \nIf there is one man or a child who understands the prayer, i.e. \ngrasps that obedience is rewarded and disobedience is punished. \nOtherwise he is only a child. It is desirable for such a person to \nstand with the Imam to his right and a little bit behind him so \nthat the Imam can be distinguished from the follower. It is \ndisliked to be level. The fact that his place is to the right is based \non what is in the Sahih that Ibn 'Abbas (radhi’Allahu anhu) \nsaid, \"I spent the night in the house of my aunt, Maymuna \n(radhi’Allahu anha) and the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) rose to pray and I stood at his left and he moved me with \nhis hand behind his back to the right side.  \n \n11.4b Two men or more men  \n \nTwo men or more stand behind the Imam \n  \nThis is based on what is in Sahih Muslim where Jabir \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) said, \"The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) stood to pray and I went and stood at the left of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) and he took my hand and brought \nme round to stand at his right Then Jabir ibn Sakhr \n(radhi’Allahu anhu) came and stood at the left of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) and he took our hands and pushed \nus until he had us stand behind him.\"  \n \n11.4c Women  \n \nIf there is a woman there as well she stands behind the \nmen \n  \nIf there a woman, she stands behind the men because of what is in \nSahih Muslim where Anas (radhi’Allahu anhu) said, \"When I \nwas an orphan in our house, I prayed behind the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and Umm Sulaym (radhi’Allahu anha) \nwas behind us.\"  \n \n11.4d A man and a woman following the Imam  \n \nIf there is just one man and a woman praying with the \nImam, the man stands on the Imam's right and the woman \nstands behind them \n  \nThe man, or the child who understands the act of worship, stands \nto the right and the woman stands behind them based on what \nAnas (radhi’Allahu anhu) said where the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) prayed with him and his mother or aunt and he \n(alaihi salat wa salam) made him stand to his right the woman \nbehind him. The judgment regarding a group of women with the \nImam is the same of a man is with one woman with them. That is \nindicated in the chapter of Jumu'a where he says that the women \nshould be behind the rows of men.  \n \n11.4e A man and a woman  \n \nIf a man prays with his wife, she stands behind him \n  \nQadi ibn al-'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the clearest in it \nis that the husband is like the man. Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Dwell, you and your wife, in the Garden.\" She does not stand to \nhis right, meaning it is disliked for to her do that. He should \nindicate to her to go back but the prayer of neither is invalidated \nby being level unless there is invalidation by impurity. \n  \n11.4f A boy and man  \n \nA young boy with a man stand side by side behind the \nImam as long as the boy is sensible enough not to run off \nand leave the man he is standing with on his own \n  \nWhen there is a child and a man, they stand behind the Imam \nbased on the previous hadith of Anas (radhi’Allahu anhu), but it \nis limited by the people of the Madhhab to when the boy is \nsensible and he understands the reward of the one who completes \nthe prayer and the wrong action of the one who stops. If the boy \ndoes not understand what was mentioned, the man stands to the \nright of the Imam and the child is left to stand wherever he \nwishes. \n  \nThe judgment of these ranks is that it is recommended. Whoever \ndisagrees with the order and prays otherwise has nothing against \nhim unless that the woman goes forward to the rank of the man or \nin front of the Imam. It is like a man who goes ahead of the \nImam–that is disliked without excuse. When a woman goes in \nfront of the Imam, his prayer is not invalidated nor the prayer of \nanyone with him unless he takes pleasure in looking at her or \ntouching her. The statement that it is invalid by pleasure or \nlooking is weak since there is no touching nor ejaculation. If the \none following an Imam goes in front because of an excuse, like the \nlack of space in the masjid, it is permitted for him without dislike. \n  \n11.5 The Imam's single prayer  \n \n11.5a The Imam's prayer is a group prayer  \n \nThe prayer of the regular Imam when he is alone is \nconsidered as a group prayer \n  \nThe regular Imam is the one who is appointed by the ruler or his \nrepresentative or the waqif (trustee) or group of Muslims in any \npermitted or disliked manner because the precondition of the \nwaqif demands that he be followed, even if he is disliked. It is like \nthat with the ruler or his representative, even if they command \nsomething disliked in one of two positions. It is the same whether \nthe position of the Imamate is in an actual masjid or is a \njudgment, and thus ships are included in it, and any place in \nwhich there is normally a group prayer. \n  \nOn his own he is considered to achieve the group prayer in its \nexcellence and judgment. Therefore another group prayer is not \nrepeated and it is not held in that masjid again. Whoever prays \nalone repeats it with him, but with the precondition that the \nprayer is within its normal time and people expect it normally, \nwith the intention of the Imam, the adhan and the iqama. He can \njoin prayers alone on the night of rain because the difficulty in \nrespect of it and he says, \"Allah hears whoever praises him,\" and \ndoes not add, \"Our Lord, praise is yours,\" i.e. that is disliked. \n  \n11.5b No two prayers in the masjid  \n \nIt is disliked for there to be two group prayers for any one \nprayer in any masjid that has a regular Imam \n  \nBefore, after or with the regular Imam according to the position of \nthe school that it is unlawful for anyone to pray the prayer while \nthe regular Imam is praying it, alone or in a group, because that \nwould lead to mutual hate and dispute between the Imams and \nthe splitting of the community whereas the Shari‟ah commands \nharmony. \n  \n11.5c If someone has already prayed he cannot be Imam \n  \nAnyone who has already prayed a particular prayer cannot \nthen be the Imam for that same prayer for anyone else \n  \nAnyone who has prayed an obligatory prayer alone or in a group, \nas Imam or following, cannot lead that prayer which he repeats. It \nis known from the Madhhab that it is not permitted for someone \ndoing a fard prayer to follow someone doing a voluntary one and is \nrepeating that in which he led a group if they wish, which is the \napproved position of the school, or individuals. Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says \"individuals\" and it seems that he \nnoted the Madhhab of the opponent because the first prayer is \nallowed by Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. \nWhen they repeat it in a group, they become like the one who \nprayed in a group and then repeated in another group.  \n \n11.6 How to follow the Imam  \n \n11.6a Following the Imam in the sujud of forgetfulness  \n \nIf the Imam leaves out something in his prayer and does \nthe sujud of forgetfulness those behind him follow him \neven though they themselves have not left anything out \n  \nIt is obligatory that the one following follow him, even if he did it \nbefore him. The question has different cases. If he caught all the \nprayer with him, he is obliged to follow him in every aspect, \nwhether prostration before or after. If he preceded him, then he \nmust either have a rak'at with him or not. If he had a rak'at with \nhim and his prostration is before, then he prostrates with him. If \nit is after, he does not prostate with him and waits for him sitting, \naccording to what is in the Mudawwana. They said that he is \nsilent and does not say that tashahhud with him. If he differs \nand prostrates, then his prayer is invalid. If he is ignorant, \nShaikh 'Isa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he always repeats it. \nHe said in al-Bayan, and it is the most comparable on the basis of \nthe Madhhab is that it is because he has introduced into the \nprayer what is not part of it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) has excused it when it is ignorance and says that its \njudgment is that of forgetfulness to observe the one who says that \nhe used to prostrate with the Imam. \n  \nIf he does not do a rak'at with him, he does not consequently \nprostrate afterwards. As for the prostration before, Shaikh \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he does not \nfollow him. If he differs and follows him, then his prayer is \ninvalid, whether intentional or by ignorance, not by \noversight. The basis is in what ad-Daraqutni (radhi’Allahu \nanhu) reported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"There is no oversight against the person following the \nImam. If the Imam forgets, then it is against him and whoever \nfollows him.\" In the two Sahih collections is that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The Imam is made to be followed in \nthe states of the prayer.\"  \n \n11.6b Not preceding the Imam  \n \nNo one should raise their head before the Imam nor do any \nof the actions of the prayer until he has done them \n  \nNone of those following the Imam precedes him in ruku', \nprostration or anything else. If he gets ahead of him, he returns to \nhim thinking to catch him before rising. Is returning Sunnah or \nobligatory? Shaikh al-Mawwaq (rahmatullahi alaihi) confined \nhimself to the second and even if he fails to return, his prayer is \nvalid since he took his obligation with the Imam before he rose. \nOtherwise, it is obligatory for him to return. If he omits it \nintentionally or by ignorance, then his prayer is invalid, but \nnot by oversight. It is in the position of the one who is crowded \nand it is an analogy with the lowering.  \n \nNot going down before the Imam is based on what is in the Sahih \ncollections that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Does not the one who raises his head before the Imam fear that \nAllah will transform his face into that of a donkey or make his \nform the form of a donkey?\" In the variant of Sahih Muslim is that \nhe said, \"O people! I am your Imam so do not precede me in \nbowing, prostration, standing or leaving.  \n \nYou only do something after he has begun to do it. It is better to \ndo it after he has begun it and to catch him in it. This is outside of \nthe standing up after two rak'ats. In the rak'at, he must not do it \nuntil the Imam is already standing. The basis for that is that \nShaikh al-Bara' (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"When the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, 'Allah hears whoever praises \nHim,' none of them moved his back, i.e. stood up until the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) had gone into prostration. Then \nwe went into prostration after him,\" i.e. they delayed beginning \ntheir action from when he began it and they begin their action \nbefore he finished his prostration. The commentator of the hadith \nsaid, \"It is forbidden to precede the Imam and to do it at the same \ntime as him, and it is disliked to delay until he moves on to \nanother pillar of the prayer. It is also said that accompanying him \nis disliked.  \n \n11.6c Beginning the prayer behind the Imam  \n \nYou begin the prayer after he has begun it \n  \nThe one following begins the prayer with the takbir after the \nImam has said it. This is obligatory. This is after he finishes \nsaying the takbir. If he says it before him or at the same \ntime as him, then his prayer is invalid, whether he concludes \nit before him, with him, or after him. There are six forms of this. If \nhe begins after him and ends before him, it is invalid, and if \nhe ends with him or after him, it is sound. So the forms are \nnine. The same applies to the salam, although in the case of \ntahrim, there is no difference between the intentional and the \noversight. In the case of the salam, it is confined to the \nintentional, not to oversight. So his prayer is not invalid by that \nsalam.  \n \nNote: When he knows that he has said the tahrim before the \nImam and wants to say it after him, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that he says the takbir and not the salam because it is \nas if he has not said the takbir by his disagreement from what he \nwas commanded. Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nhe says the salam because he disagrees about the validity of the \nfirst tahrim.  \n \n11.6d Standing up  \n \nstand up after two rak'ats after he has stood up  \n \ni.e. it is recommended to stand after the Imam is completely \nstanding.  \n \n11.6e The Salam  \n \nand say the salam after he has said the salam \n  \nThis is obligatory. If he says it before him or at the same time, \nthen his prayer is invalid, unless he starts from forgetfulness. \nOtherwise, he waits until the Imam says the salam and then says \nthe salam after him.  \n \n11.6f Other actions  \n \nAs for any other of the actions of the prayer, it is \nacceptable to do them at the same time as the Imam but it \nis better to do them after him \n  \ni.e. other than beginning, standing up from two rak'ats, and the \nsalam. These are like going down into ruku', prostration, standing \nfor the second and the fourth. It is permitted to do them at the \nsame time, even though it is disliked, as is shown by the fact that \nhe says, \"it is better.\"  \n \n11.6g Omissions by the follower  \n \nIf anything is left out (sahw) by someone praying behind \nan Imam, the responsibility for it is borne by the Imam \n  \nThis is like the takbir and the words of the tashahhud or adding a \nsajda or ruku'. There is no understanding of oversight, and it \nincludes some intentionality, like omitting the takbir or the \ntashahhud. That is while he is following the Imam. If he arrived \nlate and forgets while making up what the missed with the Imam, \nthe Imam is not responsible for it because following has ended and \nhis judgment is that of someone praying alone. Then there are \nexceptions which he mentioned:  \n \n11.6h Exceptions  \n \nexcept if it is something like not going into ruku' [Lit. like \nthe rak'at] or sujud or leaving out the \"Allahu Akbar\" that \nbegins the prayer (takbirat al-ihram) or the salam at the \nend or neglecting to make the intention for that specific \nprayer \n  \n\"Like the rak'at\" means all that is obligatory except for the Fatiha, \nand the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not enumerate it. That is \nbecause all of these are obligations and the obligations do not fall \naside by forgetfulness and are not made up by prostration.  \n \n11.6i A meritorious action: the Imam changing his position \nafter the prayer  \n \nThe Imam should not stay in the same place after he has \nsaid the salam but should move away  \n \nWhen the Imam has said the salam for the obligatory prayer, he \nshould not remain where he is, whether the prayer is nafila or not, \nbut should move. It is clear in the words of the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he moves. What is meant is not that he \nleaves the mihrab. What is meant is to move to the right or left. \nShaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is enough that \nhe change his place. Shaikh ath-Tha'labi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"This is the Sunnah.\"  \n \nThere is disagreement about the reason for it. It is said that he \nonly deserves the place for the sake of the prayer. When he \nfinishes, he does not deserve it. It is said that the reason is to \navoid confusion for the one who arrives. It is transmitted from \nImam ash-Shafi‟i RA) that he stays firm a little after the salam \nbased on what is in the Sahih of Muslim that when he said the \nsalam, he only sat for as long as to say, \"O Allah, You are the \nPeace and peace is from You. You are blessed, O You with Majesty \nand Honor.\"  \n \nThen he makes an exception about the Imam moving his place \nafter the salam: \n  \n11.6j An exception \n  \nexcept if he is in his own place in which case he can do \neither  \n \nThis means his house while he is resident or his mount while \ntraveling or if he is in some wasteland. It is permitted for him \nwithout dislike because he is safe from what might be feared in \nthat.  \n \nPoint: Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and a group of scholars \ndisliked for the Imams of the masjids and groups to make \nsupplication out loud after the obligatory prayers for those who \nare present so as to convey precedence and honor for this Imam \nand establishing him as a medium between Allah azza wa jall and \nHis servants to obtain their best interests through him in \nsupplication. Thus he is on the verge of exalting himself and his \nheart will be corrupted and he will disobey his Lord in this state \nmore than obeying Him. It is related that one of the Imams asked \n'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu) for permission to make \nsupplication for his people after the prayer and he replied, \"No, I \nfear that you will become arrogant until you reach for the Pleads!\"  \n \n \n \nChapter Twelve: On Various Aspects of the \nPrayer \n \n \nThis deals with various topics which go beyond the prayer, like the \none who is certain about wudu' and uncertain about breaking it, \nthe one who cannot touch water by necessity or does not find \nanyone to bring it to him who does tayammum.  \n \n12.1 Clothing in the prayer  \n \n12.1a Minimum Clothing for a woman  \n \nThe least amount of clothing in which is acceptable for a \nwoman to do the prayer is a robe which cannot be seen \nthrough which is long enough to cover the tops of her feet \nand a head covering through which the hair cannot be \nseen \n  \nTwo things are necessary: a robe, and the descriptive words means \neither thick or enveloping. According to the second, it should be \nample so that it covers the tops of the her feet.  \n \nThe second item is a head covering. It is a garment with which a \nwoman covers her head. Its precondition is the same as the long \ngarment, in that it has to be thick and not transparent. If she \nprays in something which is lightly woven and transparent, and it \nis something which shows the 'awra without thinking, then she \nalways repeats the prayer. If it only defines the 'awra, it is \ndisliked and she repeats it within the time. The man is like the \nwoman in that. So the woman must cover the top and soles of her \nfeet and her neck and her hair. She is permitted to only show \nher face and palms in the prayer. The basis for that is the \nwords of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"Allah does not \naccept the prayer of a woman who has reached the age of \nmenstruation except with a head covering\" In one variant, \"The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was asked, \"Can a woman \npray in a robe and head covering without a waist-wrapper?\" He \nsaid, \"If the robe is ample and covers the tops of her feet.\" \n  \n12.1b Minimum Clothing for a Man  \n \nThe least which is acceptable for a man is a single garment \n  \nWithout dislike if it is thick and conceals all his body. If it only \ncovers his private parts, then his prayer is allowed but there is \ndislike.  \n \n12.1c What should not be covered  \n \nYou should not cover your nose or your face in the prayer  \n \nNeither a man nor woman should cover the face in the prayer. All \nthese things which are prohibited are disliked.  \n \n12.1d Gathering clothes and tying back hair \n  \nnor should you gather up your clothes or tie back your \nhair especially for it \n  \nAs for gathering up the clothes, it is disliked when it is done \nspecifically for the prayer or because of fear that clothes might get \ndirty because that contains a form of non-humility. When he is \nworking and the time for the prayer comes while he is like that, he \nis permitted to pray with what he has on without dislike.  \n \nAs for tying back the hair, it is disliked if that is in order to keep \nthe hair from becoming dirtied by the earth or he does that for the \nprayer, i.e. ties his hair for the especially prayer .  \n \n12.2 Prostration on account of a mistake  \n \n12.2a Adding to the prayer  \n \nAny time you inadvertently add something to the prayer \nyou should do two sajdas after saying the salam and then \ndo the tashahhud and say the salam again \n  \nThis is whenever the Imam, the one on his own or the one \nfollowing makes a mistake in one of the suras or in what is \nprescribed for him in the obligatory or nafila prayer, according to \nwhat is in the Mudawwana as opposed to the one who said that \nthere is no prostration in the nafila. Our evidence is in the words \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"There are two \nprostration‟s for every forgetfulness.\" The result is that the nafila \nis like the obligatory except in five questions, silent and out loud: \nthe sura is overlooked in the nafila rather than the obligatory. The \nfourth is when he raises his head from ruku', he completes it as a \nfourth in the nafila as opposed to the fard. The fifth is when he \nforgets a pillar of the nafila, and a long time has passed or he has \nbegun an obligatory prayer or nafila, and has bowed - he does not \nhave do anything, as opposed to the fard, which he must repeat.  \n \nIf you add something, whether outside the words of the prayer, \nlike speaking inadvertently, or an action of the prayer, like bowing \nand prostrating, you prostrate for the forgetfulness in the Sunnah \naccording to what is in the Mukhtasar and in at-Tiraz as the \nobligation of doing it afterwards. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that.  \n \n12.2b Only two prostration’s  \n \nHe does the two prostration‟s after the salam, even if there is more \nthan one oversight as long as it is not a lot. Otherwise the prayer \nwould be invalid whether it is from other than the words of the \nprayer, like speech out of forgetfulness and is lengthy. If it is part \nof the words of the prayer, there is not prostration for saying it \nforgetfully, as the prayer is not invalid if it is intentional, as when \nhe repeats the sura or adds a sura at the end of it, unless the \nwords are a fard. Then he would prostrate for forgetfulness. This \nis like when he repeats the Fatiha out of forgetfulness, even in the \nsame rak'at. There is disagreement about whether the prayer is \ninvalidated by deliberately reciting it. The accepted position is \nthat it is not invalid.  \n \nOr he may add something which is not one of the actions of the \nprayer, as when he forgets that he is praying and eats and drinks. \nThere is disagreement about that and it is said that all of them \ninvalidates the prayer, whether a lot or not. It is said that if it is a \nlot, it invalidates, and otherwise it does not and is put right by the \nprostration.  \n \nOr it can be one of the actions of the prayer when there is a lot of \nit in the four rak'ats, like the four actual rak'ats based on what is \nwell-known from Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nthose who follow him. The rak'at is considered to be rising from \nruku'. When he raises his head from the second in four, or the first \nin three or four in two, then the prayer is invalid. There are two \npositions about whether it is invalid by half of it. It is said that it \nis invalid, and it is said that it is not, and that is the accepted \nposition. He prostrates for forgetfulness.  \n \nA lot in two is like two rak'ats. It is not invalidated by adding one \nrak'at in the famous position, like the two of Subh and Jumu'a, \nbased on its being fard in its day. Opposite it is that it is only \ninvalid by adding four rak'ats. It is like the four while traveling. \nThey are not invalid except by adding four rak'ats. A lot in \nMaghrib is four rak'ats in the approved position that three is like \nfour and its not invalidated except by adding four complete \nrak'ats.  \n \n12.2c Missing out something  \n \nIf you miss something out of the prayer you should do two \nsajdas before saying the salam after having finished the \ntashahhud. You then do the tashahhud again and say the \nsalam.  \n \nThere is the case when the Imam or the one alone or the one \nfollowing omit something which is a confirmed Sunnah, or the two \nminor Sunnah‟s, whether it is an actual decrease or uncertain one. \nThe confirmed Sunnah‟s are those for which there are \nprostration‟s are eight:  \n \nRecitation of more than the Fatiha in the fard, and so he \nprostrates for omitting that in the fard, but not in a nafila.  \n \nReciting out loud in the prayers which are out loud, and he \nprostrates for omitting that in the fard, not the nafila since he can \ndo them silently.  \n \nDoing it silently in its place. When he recites out loud in the place \nof the silent, he prostrates before the salam. This is related from \nthe opinion of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), but it is \nweak. What is approved is that it is after the salam.  \n \nA takbir other than the takbir al-ihram. This is based on all of \nthem being one sunnah. As for the statement that each takbir is a \nsunnah, which is what the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of al-\nMukhtasar says and is stated in al-Mudawwana as well, he \nprostrates for omitting two takbirs.  \n \nThe words, \"Allah hears whoever praises Him.\" It is applies as \nwhat is before it does.  \n \nThe first tashahhud and sitting for it. It is one Sunnah, and its \nwords are one Sunnah, and the sitting for it is another Sunnah, \nand so it is composed of three Sunnah‟s.  \n \nThe final tashahhud.  \n \nThere is no prostration for other than these eight and the \nprostration before the salam is after the tashahhud. Then you \nfinish the two prostration‟s and do the tashahhud a second time in \nthe well-known position and then say the salam. It is preferred by \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and he stated that part \nof the sunnah of the salam is that it follows the tashahhud. His \nwords imply that he does not repeat the prayer on the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam). That is the case.]  \n \n12.2d Not repeating the tashahhud  \n \nSome people say that it is not necessary to repeat the \ntashahhud \n  \nThat is also related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nShaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred it because \nthe method of one sitting does not have the tashahhud repeated in \nit twice.  \n \n12.2e Both omitting and adding  \n \nIf you both leave something out and add something you do \nthe two sajdas before the salam \n  \nIf you leave out some of the confirmed sunnah‟s and add \nsomething insignificant which was already clarified, then the \nprostration is also done before the salam, for instance, if he omits \nthe tashahhud and sitting for it and adds a prostration. What the \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned about prostrating only for \nomission first with the increase after the salam and prostrating \nonly for increase after the salam is the position of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Imam Ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat he absolutely prostrates before the salam and Imam Abu \nHanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says absolutely after it. Our evidence \nfor the increase is that it is true that once he (SAW) prayed 'Asr \nand said the salam after two rak'ats. Dhu'l-Yadayn (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) stood up and said, \"Has the prayer been shortened, \nRasulullah? Or have you forgotten?\" The Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) stood up and did the rest of the prayer and then did two \nprostration‟s after the salam while sitting,  \n \nThe evidence for the omission is that it is confirmed that he (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) prayed Dhuhr and stood after the first two rak'ats \nwithout sitting. The people stood up with him. When he finished \nthe prayer, people waited for the salam, but he said the takbir \nwhile sitting. He did two prostration‟s before the salam and then \nsaid it. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"Decrease overcomes increase when they are together.\" The hadith \ncontains an indication of the prescription of the prostration for \nforgetfulness - it is two prostration‟s. The taslim done forgetfully \ndoes not invalidate the prayer. A slight gap after it does not \ninvalidate it. Words of no use by the Imam and the one following \ndo not invalidate the prayer.  \n \n12.2f Forgetting to do the prostration of forgetfulness \nbefore  \n \nIf you forget to do the two sajdas which should be done \nafter the salam you do them whenever you remember them \neven if a long time has elapsed \n  \nThe prostration of forgetfulness which are after the salam should \nbe done afterwards, even if it is a long time after the salam of the \nprayer, even after a month. The prostration afterwards is to spite \nShaitan. So it is appropriate that he prostrate, even later.  \n \n12.2g Forgetting to do the prostration of forgetfulness \nbefore  \n \nIf you forget to do the two sajdas which should be done \nbefore the salam \n  \nAs for the one before, it mends the omission in the prayer and \nshould be in it or close after it. His words in the Mudawwana is \nthat he does it, even if it is in the time which it is forbidden. If he \nremembers it in a prayer which is not obligatory in the time of \nprohibition, he delays it until the nafila. It is also clear that it if it \nis a consequence of the Jumu'a prayer, he does not return to the \nmasjid. The school, according to Shaikh at-Tadili (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), is that he returns to the masjid. The literal text of the \nMukhtasar is that it is particular to returning to the masjid for \nthe prostration before rather than the one after it. It is the \napproved position. This is the literal text of the Mukhtasar \nbecause he says, \"in the masjid in the Jumu'a\" in the context of \nthe words about the prostration before.  \n \nThe prostration before must be done in the masjid in which the \nJumu'a was performed if he misses the first rak'at of Jumu'a and \nrises to finish it and forgets the sura and leaves the masjid and a \nlong time has not passed. He returns to the masjid in which he \nprayed Jumu'a. As for the one afterwards, if when he speaks out of \nforgetfulness or adds a rak'at by forgetfulness and forgets to \nprostrate until he has left the masjid, he can prostrate in any \nmasjid.  \n \n12.2h Doing the two prostration’s later  \n \nthen you do them straight away so long as the prayer is not \nlong over \n  \nThis is when you remember them shortly after finishing the \nprayer - and this shortness is not defined according to the School. \nIt is the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). It \nis like that with length. One consults custom. Whatever the \ncustom is acted on in them. According to Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), it is defined by not having left the masjid. \n  \n12.2i After a long time  \n \nIf quite some time has elapsed, however, you have to do the \nprayer again  \n \nIf it is a long time, then he repeats the prayer. This is obligatory \nbecause it is invalid since it is a result of omitting three sunnah‟s. \nShaikh at-Tata‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is like forgetting the \nmiddle sitting, or three takbirs. This is if he omitted them by \nforgetfulness. If he left them deliberately, the prayer is invalid by \nsimply omitting them according to Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh as-Sanhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is \nonly invalid by length, even if he omits them deliberately.  \n \n12.2j Minor omissions  \n \nunless what you left out was not particularly critical such \nas only the sura which should follow the Fatiha or two \ntakbirs or saying the tashahhuds or similar things  \n \ni.e. it consists of two slight sunnah‟s like being silent or out loud, \ni.e. he prostrates for them, but when he omits that and a long time \npasses, his prayer is not invalid. This is when he comes to \nundertake it. Otherwise, it is invalid in this case because he \nomitted three sunnah‟s. It is said that it is not invalid. If he does \nnot do the standing for it. The words of Shaikh al-Jazuli \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) are useful in preferring the first. It is agreed \nthat it is invalid since he left a sura in more than one rak'at. \nWhen the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, \"only the sura which \nshould follow the Fatiha\", even after the Fatiha, it is clearer so \nthat it will not be imagined that the Fatiha is also omitted. \n\"Similar things\" are like the two praises. This is permitted as a \nmercy from Allah in the prevailing position, based on the fact that \nthe specific expression is desirable. If he omits the two \ntashahhuds and sits for them because in that case his prostration \nis only for two slight sunnah‟s.  \n \n12.2k When nothing is obliged  \n \nin which case you need not do anything \n  \ni.e. he does not have to repeat the prayer nor prostrate, i.e. even \nafter a period of time, since it is the subject of the question of the \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is known that the two slight \nsunnah‟s are prostrated for, but when a long time has passed, and \nhe does not prostrate, he is not asked to prostrate or to repeat the \nprayer since it is for two slight sunnah‟s. I know from what \npreceded that the prostration is prescribed to mend the gaps \nwhich occur in the prayer as if there is an extra ruku' or \nprostration through forgetfulness, or the omission of ruku' or \nprostration by forgetfulness, he repairs that omission before the \nsalam. If he omits a confirmed Sunnah or two slight sunnah‟s, he \nmust prostrate according to its circumstances, before or after to \nrepair those gaps. There are gaps which occur in the prayer which \nare not mended by prostration, i.e. the prostration does not \nreplace them - this is when he omits a pillar of the prayer.'  \n \n12.2l When they are not sufficient  \n \nThe two sajdas of forgetfulness are not sufficient to make \nup for missing out one full rak'at or sujud or failing to \nrecite the Fatiha in two rak'ats of any prayer (or, in case of \nSubh, one rak'at) \n  \ni.e. a full rak'at which he is certain that he omitted or is unsure of \nit during his tashahhud and before his salam. Then he must \nperform that rak'at. The manner in which he does is that he does \nit, building on the preceding rak'ats, even if that rak'at, is one of \ntwo, and he prostrates after that for the one before the salam \nbecause of moving one of the rak'ats since he is Imam or alone. If \nit is not one of two, then he prostrates after the salam after he \ndoes the rak'at for the increase, not the decrease.  \n \nIf he omits a prostration or ruku' or rising from them and \nremembers that while he is standing, for instance, or doing the \nfinal tashahhud when he realizes his omission or is unsure about \nit, and it is not possible to satisfy the fard in its place, then he \ndoes the unsure substitution and prostrates before the salam \nbecause the obligation in prostration is before. What is meant by \ndoubt is hesitation and so it includes supposition, doubt, and \nuncertainty. This is in respect of obligations because doubt in \ndecrease in them is like realizing it in the obligation of bringing \nthe unsure substitute as opposed to the sunnah‟s. He does not \nprostrate for omitting them except when he is certain of missing \nthem or it is equally balanced in his mind whether he did it or \nnote.  \n \nIn cases of failing to recite, he mentions that if someone misses \nout an obligation or pillar, he performs it, and what he mentioned \nof lack of mending by prostration for missing out a rak'at or \nprostration is agreed upon. What he mentioned of lack of mending \nby prostration for omitting the recitation of the Fatiha in the \nentire prayer is the position of the majority, and it is preferred. \nOpposite it is what Shaikh al-Waqidi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related \nfrom Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that when recitation is \nomitted in the entire prayer, his prayer is allowed.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that there are three \npositions about omitting recitation in half of the prayer, like one \nrak'at of a two rak'at prayer and two of a four rak'at prayer. The \nbest known is that he continues and prostates before the salam \nand it is desirable that he repeat his prayer in order to be careful. \nThe second is that he prostrates before the salam and it is enough \nfor him. The third is that what he omitted of the recitation \nnullifies and he does the like of it and prostrates after the salam. \nThis is what happens in the accepted position that it is obligatory \nin every rak'at. So it is accepted. Having clarified this point, he \nmoves on to its minimum omission:  \n \n12.2m Missing the Fatiha in one rak'at  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion about what you should do \nif you miss out the Fatiha in one rak'at in any prayer apart \nfrom Subh. Some people say that you only have to do the \ntwo sajdas before the salam; others say that the whole \nrak'at is invalidated and that you must do another rak'at to \nmake up for it; yet others say that you do the two sajdas \nbefore the salam without doing another rak'at but then \nrepeat the whole prayer to make sure of being correct \n  \nThis is like one rak'at of a three or four rak'at prayer. There are \nthree positions, all of which are in the Mudawwana. One is that \nthe forgetfulness in recitation is satisfied by the prostration as \nlong as it is not Subh. It does not invalidate it and satisfies it. \nShaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred this position \nbased on the fact that it is fard in the majority or based on the fact \nthat it is not obligation or that it is obligatory in one or half of the \nrak'ats.  \n \nThe second is that the rak'at from which the Fatiha was omitted is \ninvalid and he must do another rak'at to replace it. Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers this statement. This \nnecessitates that it is obligatory in every rak'at. It is the approved \nstatement. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it \nis sound. Shaikh ibn Shas (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is the \nfamous transmission.  \n \nThe third is two prostration‟s and no rak'at, but the prayer is \nrepeated to be follow the one who says that it is obligatory in \nevery rak'at. The third transmission is derived from the first. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that completing the first is \nobligatory and repeating the second is recommended for care, and \nit is only recommended.]  \n \n12.2n The best judgment  \n \nThis last judgment is the best if Allah wills \n  \nThis is because it complies with the other two positions. His \nprostration before the salam and the prayer is not invalid, \ncompiling with the position that it is obligatory in the majority, for \ninstance, and repeating the prayer compiles with the second.  \n \nTwo points from Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi): The \nfirst is that the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) does not mention the \njudgment of when he omits recitation from most of the prayer, say \nthree out of four or two of out Maghrib. There are two positions in \nthat. The best known is that he prostrates before the salam and \nrepeats the prayer out of caution, i.e. it is recommended. In short, \nit is that if he omits most and half it is not invalid and he \nprostrates before the salam and repeats the prayer out of caution.  \n \nThe second is the place of the prior dispute. All of it is about \nomitting recitation of the Fatiha when he misses the place where \nit is done. If he does not miss it in that he remembers before he \nraises his head from the ruku' he returns to his recitation.  \n \nThere are two positions about repeating the sura. Shaikh al-\nLakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) recommends that it be repeated, \nand it is the well-known position, as in at-Tawdih, either since it \nis sunnah after the Fatiha or since it is sunnah that it is only done \nafter the Fatiha. It is apparent that the second statement, which \nis that it is not repeated, is not seen by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) in the collections. He thought that the sunnah was \nobtained by reciting it either before or after the Fatiha. Allah \nknow best. Based on what Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \npreferred of repeating it, Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that he prostrates after the salam, i.e. for that increase in \nwords. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he does \nnot have to prostrate for it, i.e. he does not think a prostration is \nentailed for that increase in words. This is the predominant \nposition. The author of at-Tawdih said that Shaikh ibn Habib's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) statement is sounder because there is no \nprostration for additional recitation by evidence, even if he recites \ntwo suras or recites a sura in the last two, as it says in at-Tahqiq.  \n \n12.2o No prostration for omission of a slight sunnah or \nmeritorious action  \n \nIf you forget to say one takbir or to say 'Sami’allahu liman \nhamidah' once or to do the Qunut you do not have to do the \nsajdas of forgetfulness \n  \nExcept for the takbir al-ihram. As for not prostrating for one \ntakbir, that is well-known. On that basis, if he prostrates for it \nbefore the salam, his prayer is invalid, unless he is following \nsomeone who believes that there is prostration for omitting that. \nThen his prayer is not invalid as it is not invalid if he omits the \nprostration after it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that he prostrates for it, and what he mentioned of not \nprostrating for omitting the one praise is the School. There is no \nprostration for omitting the Qunut. If he prostrates for it before \nthe salam, his prayer is invalid.  \n \n12.2p Remembering omissions after finishing the prayer  \n \nIf you finish the prayer and then remember that you left \nout part of it, you should go back to it straight-away by \nsaying a new takbir al-ihram - provided that very little \ntime has passed since you finished it -  \n \nThis is if you finish with the salam, believing you have done the \nprayer in full, forgetting that you have omitted something. This is \nnot incompatible with saying the salam intentionally. If he says \nthe salam forgetting that he is in the prayer or that he is speaking \nthe salam, then he is in the position of the one who did not say the \nsalam, and so he catches what he omitted. If he finishes and then \nremembers with certainty or doubt, and what is meant is by \nuncertainty is supposition, doubt, or suspicion, and he remembers \nthat he owes one of the obligatory pillars of the prayer like the \nruku', prostration or sitting according to the salam. If he says the \nsalam forgetting when rising from prostration, he sits for the \namount of the salam and says the salam, and then goes back, i.e. \nintends to complete it if it is close to the time where he left. \nShaikh at-Tata‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that literal position of \nthe school demands that he prays where he is immediately. If he \ndoes not do so and prays in another place, his prayer is invalid.  \n \nWhen he resumes and intends to complete the prayer, he says the \ntakbir al-ihram, with his intention to resume accompanying the \ntakbir. His outward words, \"very little time has passed\" is the \ntransmission of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). This is the accepted position. \nOpposite is that it is that if very little time has passed, he does not \nsay the tahrim. The difference is about the takbir. There is \nagreement about the intention. When we said that he resumes \nwith the tahrim, if he remembers while he is sitting, he says the \ntahrim as he is and does not have to stand. This is when he has \nleft the prayer from the place of sitting. If he has left it in another \nplace, like ending after praying one rak'at or three, except for \nMaghrib, he returns to rising from prostration and says that \ntahrim for it and does not sit. If he remembers while he is \nstanding, there are two statements about his tahrim. In short, the \nearly companions of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) believed \nthat he says the tahrim from standing because of because of \nimmediacy. On that basis, there are two positions on whether he \nsits afterwards and then rise or not. Shaikh ibn Shiblun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) believed that he sits because it was the state \nin which he left the prayer. That is the accepted position. He does \nnot say the takbir for that sitting. He sits without a takbir. When \nhe sits, he says the takbir for ihram, and then he stands with the \ntakbir which is done by the one who leaves the prayer after two. \nThe place is that he sits is for ihram when he says the salam after \ntwo. As for the one who says the salam for one or three, he returns \nto the state of his rising from prostration and says the tahrim and \ndoes not sit since that is the place of his sitting. It is desirable for \nhim to raise his hands when the takbir is said.  \n \n12.2q Doing what was missed out  \n \nand then do whatever it was that you missed out \n  \nAfter the takbir al-ihram, he prays the rest of the prayer when he \nsays the salam with certainly that his prayer was complete. If he \nsaid it either knowing that his prayer was not complete or being \nunsure whether it is clear that it was complete or incomplete, then \nthe prayer is invalid. You know what happens if you remember \nafter you said the salam. When you remember it before the salam, \nand it is in the last rak'at, he is either in ruku' or not. If he is in \nruku' he does it standing. If he has come up from ruku', he does it \nfixed. If it is in prostration, he does from a sitting position, or from \ntwo, then he does them from standing. If he does them from \nsitting out of forgetfulness then he prostrates before the salam \nbecause of the lack of going down for them which is not obligatory. \nOtherwise, it would not be mended by the prostration of \nforgetfulness. It is disliked to do that deliberately as Shaikh \nZarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \nIf what is omitted is not in the last, he does it as we stated when it \nis in the last in sitting or standing or bending and he has not \ncompleted the rak'at after the rak'at which has an omission, when \nhe finishes it, he has misses it and puts what he has done in its \nplace when he is alone or an Imam. What we mentioned is that he \ndoes the omitted obligation if he can catch it. If what was omitted \nwas the intention and the takbir al-ihram, they cannot be caught \nbecause if they are forgotten, there is no prayer. If he forgets one \nof them, he starts the prayer from its beginning. Know that the \nunsure omission is like the definite one, What is meant by doubt is \nhesitation. As for in the sunnah‟s, he only considers certain \nomission or where the doubt is equally balanced, not suspicion. \n \n12.2r After a long lapse of time  \n \nIf, however, a long time has elapsed or you have left the \nmasjid, you must begin the whole prayer again \n  \nIf you remember after a long time has passes after finishing the \nprayer, which is defined by custom according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) or you leave the masjid according to Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), you must begin again because one of the \npreconditions of the prayer is that all of it is at the same time.  \n \n12.2s Forgetting the salam  \n \nThat is also the case if someone forgets the salam \n  \nHe returns to sitting if it is soon and says the takbir al-ihram \nwhile seated and says the tashahhud. He brings the salam and \nprostrates after the salam, even if that is has been a long time or \nhe has left the masjid where he began his prayer and his place. He \nsays the takbir al-ihram while seated and the tashahhud and \nbrings the salam when he remembers the salam after leaving the \nplace. If he remembers it soon while he is sitting facing qibla, he \nsays the salam where he is and does not need a takbir by which he \nsays the ihram and he does not say a tashahhud. If he turns from \nit, they prayer is not invalidated if he faces it and says the salam \nHe does not owe the takbir al-ihram, or the tashahhud and he \nmust prostrate after the salam for forgetfulness.  \n \n12.2t Uncertainty about the number of rak'ats  \n \nIf you do not know whether you have prayed three or four \nrak'ats you build on what you are certain of, repeating \nanything you are unsure about, in this case praying \nanother rak'at to make sure of having prayed four. You \nthen do the sajdas of forgetfulness after the salam.  \n \nHe prays until he is uncertain. So if he is certain about three, and \nunsure about the fourth, complete discharge of responsibility is \nonly obtained by four. That is what the author means, \"He repeats \nanything he is unsure about\". He prostrates after the salam in the \nfamous position. Shaikh ibn Lubaba (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat he prostrates before the salam, and it is the literal \ninterpretation of what is in the Muwatta' and Muslim where the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When one you is \nunsure about his prayer and does not know whether he has \nprayed three or four, he should remove the doubt and build on \nwhat he is certain about and then do two prostration‟s before the \nsalam.\" \n \n12.2u Speaking inadvertently in the prayer  \n \nIf you speak during the prayer inadvertently, you also do \nthe sajdas of forgetfulness after the salam \n  \nThis is if the Imam or the individual speaks a little in the prayer, \nforgetting he is in the prayer or that he is speaking. If he speaks \ndeliberately, his prayer is invalid unless it has no purpose and so \nit is not invalid unless it is a lot in himself. A lot is known by \ncustom. Then he prostrates after the salam because it is increase \nand is mended by the prostration. Forgetfulness excludes the \nintentional, ignorant and the one forced, and the one who is \nobliged to speak to rescue a blind person, for instance. Their \nprayer is invalid.  \n \n12.2v Uncertainty about having said the salam  \n \nIf you are not sure whether you said the salam or not, you \nsay it and do not do any sajdas of forgetfulness \n  \nHe does not rise from his place. If it is near the tashahhud, and \ndoes not prostrate for forgetfulness because he said the salam, and \nhis prayer is complete. The second salam occurs outside the prayer \nand so there is no reason for prostration. If he did not say the \nsalam, he says it now, and no forgetfulness occurs from him for \nwhich he prostrates. When it is near, but he has moved from his \nplace, i.e. has not turned from qibla, he says the takbir again, the \ntashahhud and the salam and prostrates after the salam because \nof the increase. If he has not moved but turned from qibla, he \nfaces it and says the salam and does not do the tashahhud or \ntahrim and prostrates after the salam.  \n \n12.3 Constant Doubts  \n \n12.3a The case of someone subject to constant doubts  \n \nAnyone who finds themselves thinking all the time that \nthey have made a mistake in the prayer should pay no \nattention to their doubts \n  \nIf this happens, it is obligatory to ignore it and he should rely on \nwhat he feels in himself about that because it is a test from \nShaitan. When it has power over the heart, no action ever \nsucceeds with it and so the useful remedy for this disease which \nbrings about confusion is to turn away and the most beneficial \nremedy is to remember Allah azza wa jall: \"As for those who are \ngodfearing, when they are bothered by visitors from Shaitan, they \nremember. \" (7:201) When he says to him, for instance, \"You have \nonly prayed three,\" so he says, \"I have only prayed four and my \nprayer is sound.\"  \n \n12.3b What he does  \n \nThey do not have to do anything in reparation but they \nshould do the two sajdas after the salam \n  \nIf he repairs and builds on what he is certain about, his prayer is \nnot invalid as Shaikh al-Khattabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. \nPerhaps his reason is that the basis is building on certainty. He \nignores the person with constant doubts to make things easier for \nhim. According to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), it is \nrecommended that he prostrate after the salam because is more \nlike an addition if someone is like this since when he is unsure \nabout whether he prayed three or four, he might well pray five.  \n \n12.3c General position about people with doubts  \n \nThis refers to people who find this happening a lot and \nwho are continually in doubt about whether they have \nadded something to the prayer or left something out and \nnever feel certain that they have prayed correctly \n  \ni.e. doubt occurs very frequently, and he is always unsure about \nwhether he omitted or forgot. The end of the excuse in it is that he \ndoes not have to prostrate by way of the sunnah. This does not \ncontradict the fact that it is recommended for him to prostrate.  \n \nKnow that a lot is considered to be when this occurs to him in \nevery prayer or every wudu', or once to twice every day, or when it \ncomes one day and stops, or two days and then stops in the third. \nThat is the person with frequent doubt. If it comes two days and \nthen stops on the third, that is not someone with continual doubt, \nas when it comes to him one day about wudu' and one day about \nthe prayer: he is not someone with continual doubt because the \ndoubt about the means, like wudu' does not include doubt about \naims, like the prayer.  \n \n12.3d What such people do  \n \nThey should only do the two sajdas after the salam. On the \nother hand if they are certain that they have made a \nmistake they should make the appropriate reparation and \ndo the sajdas of forgetfulness \n  \nHe only has to prostrate after the salam only. However, if someone \nis certain that he is omitted something which would invalidate a \nrak'at, i.e. he is certain that he had forgotten a prostration or \nruku' and failed to catch it, as when he remembers while he is in \nthe final tashahhud, for instance, he does a rak'at in place of that \nwhich was corrupted and then he prostrates. If the rak'at in which \nhe forgot is one of the first two, he prostrates before the salam, \nbecause he has both increase and decrease. The increase is the \nrak'at which he nullified and sitting in other than its proper place. \nthe decrease is by omitting the sura because he brings a dubious \nrak'at by building, i.e., with the Fatiha only. If it is one of the last \ntwo, he only has increase and so he prostrates after the salam.  \n \n12.3e Always making the same mistake  \n \nIf someone is always making a particular mistake in the \nprayer and this happens a lot, he should make the \nappropriate \nreparation \nbut \nnot \ndo \nthe \nsajdas \nof \nforgetfulness \n  \nIf he often forgets something, as when it becomes his habit to \nalways forget the first sitting, or to forget the prostration, he puts \nit right. The reparation of that has two aspects: one is that he \nmissed the place of catching it and the second that he did not. The \nexample of the first is the one is someone who habitually forgets \nthe second prostration of the second rak'at, for instance, without it \nbeing a two rak'at prayer and he only remembers after the salam \nor after starting the third. He does a rak'at in the first and does \nnot prostrate and the third becomes the second and he does not \nprostrate. The example of the second is when he remembers in the \nfard before he starts the third. These two aspects are included \nunder \"appropriate reparation\". He does not prostrate for his \nforgetfulness.  \n \n12.3f Standing up directly after prostration  \n \nIf you begin to stand up directly from sujud at the end of \ntwo rak'ats you should sit back down again as long as your \nhands and knees have not left the ground \n  \nMeaning you move to rise. We do not take it literally so that it \ndoes not contradict with his words \"after he goes back\" because it \nliterally means that he does not stand up after two of the \nobligatory prayer, omitting the sitting and whoever obliges that he \nomits the tashahhud. When he sits and stands up forgetting the \ntashahhud, he does not go back nor prostrate for it. It is agreed \nabout when his hands and knees have not left the ground, so it \napplies even more if only his hands or knees have left the ground. \nThen he does the tashahhud and completes the prayer and does \nnot have to prostrate because of the insignificance of that. If he \ncontinues to stand up deliberately, his prayer is invalid in the \nwell-known \nposition \nbecause \nhe \nomitted \nthree \nsunnah‟s \ndeliberately. If he continues out of forgetfulness, he prostrates \nbefore the salam. \n \n12.3g What is done in this case  \n \nIf they have you should continue on up and not go back \ndown and then do the sajdas of forgetfulness before the \nsalam \n  \nIf his hands and knees have left the ground, he continues. If the \ntime of omission has been a long time and he has not prostrated, \nhis prayer is invalid. This is true in two cases: one is when he \nleaves the earth with his hands and knees without standing up \nstraight and then remembers after he has left the earth. The \nsecond is that he has left the earth and stood up straight. The \njudgment in it is the same: he continues and does not go back and \nthen he prostrates before the salam. However if he differs and \nreturns to sitting in the first instance deliberately, forgetfully or \nby ignorance, his prayer is not invalid and he prostrates after the \nsalam for the addition.  \n \nIn the second case, if he deliberately returns to sitting, the Tawdih \nstates that is well-known that it is sound, and he prostrates for it \nafter the salam for the addition. If he returns by ignorance, \nShaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) is reported in an-Nawadir as \nsaying that his prayer is invalid. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related that he continues his prayer and \nthen prostrates. If he goes back, he does not rise until he does the \ntashahhud .  \n \nIf he abandoned the tashahhud deliberately after returning, then \nhis prayer is invalid according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), but not of Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Perhaps the words of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) are based on its being invalid by deliberately abandoning a \nsunnah which differs from Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nIt is like that in some commentaries on Shaikh Khalil \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). If he goes back inadvertently, there is \nagreement that his prayer is not invalid. He prostrates after the \nsalam.  \n \n12.4 Missing a Prayer  \n \n12.4a Missing a prayer  \n \nIf you have missed a prayer you should do it as soon as you \nremember in the same way that you would have done it if \nyou have done it at its right time  \n \nIf you remember a prayer which you forgot, or slept through or \ndeliberately omitted in the well-known position of the School, you \nmust make it up without any disagreement in the case of the \nforgotten prayer, and the recognized position of the School in the \ncase of the deliberately omitted prayer. The basis for that is what \nSahih Muslim related that Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"If anyone forgets a prayer or sleeps through it, its expiation \nis that he pray it when he remembers it.\"  \n \nWhen you remember is whether it is in night or day at the sunrise \nand sunset, i.e. whenever you are certain or think that you have \nomitted it. As for when you are unsure, and things are equally \nbalanced, it must be made up, but you avoid those times of the \nprohibition, as is obligatory in the forbidden times and desirable \nto forbid the disliked times. As for a suspicion of omission or \nlogical possibility, it is neither obliged nor desirable to make it up \nin such cases. It is clear from the words of the author that it is \nobligatory to make up missed prayers immediately, and it is not \npermitted to delay except for an excuse.  \n \nHe does the number of ruku' and prostration and its forms - silent \nor aloud and does the Qunut if it is Subh and does the iqama for \nevery prayer. If he forgets it on a journey, he makes it up as on a \njourney. If he forgets it while resident, he makes it up as resident. \nHe the time of making it up and missing it differ in respect of \nhealth or illness, he takes account of the time when he is making \nthem up. If he misses it while healthy and is ill when he makes it \nup and can only make the intention or indicate with gesture, he \nmakes it up with intention or gesture and does not defer it \nbecause he might die. If this is adequate in performing the prayer, \nit is even more proper that it be adequate when making up a \nprayer.  \n \n12.4b Repeating prayers done after the missed prayer  \n \nIf you have already done the prayer of the time you are in \nyou should do it again after making up the prayer you \nmissed \n  \nThen after making up the missed prayers, you repeat the current \nprayer when it is within its time. This applies equally to the \nImam, the one praying alone, and one following. It is desirable for \neach of them to do it if he remembers a small number of missed \nprayers - four or five - after he has prayed the current prayer and \nthere still remains enough time to repeat the current prayer after \nmaking up what he forgot of a small number of missed prayers. \nThe example of that is if he forgets Maghrib of the day before, for \ninstance, and remembers it after he has prayed Subh the following \nday and before the sun rises. He prays Maghrib and repeats Subh, \nbut does not repeat 'Isha' since its time has gone. If he remembers \nMaghrib after sunrise, he does it and does not repeat anything at \nall.  \n \nIf he has prayed the current one and then remembers several \nmissed prayers, six or five, he does not repeat the present prayer \nafter he makes up what he missed. \n  \n12.4c If there are a lot of prayers to make up  \n \nIf you have a lot of prayers to make up you can do them at \nany time of the day or night, including sunrise and sunset, \naccording to what is convenient in your particular \nsituation \n  \nIf he has forgotten them, or slept through them, or intentionally \nleft them, he makes them up at any time of the day or night, even \nat sunset and sunset. He first spoke about a few prayers and here \nabout many, and repeats his words about sunset and sunrise to \nindicate Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) who says that \nonly Subh of the day can be prayed at sunrise and at sunset only \n'Asr of the day. His evidence is the previous hadith. However he \nindicates that hardship is removed when they are made up \nwithout laxness. Then he indicates the second part:  \n \n12.4d Less than five prayers to make up  \n \nIf the number of prayers you have to make up is less than \nfive you should do them before doing the prayer of the \ntime you are in even if that means going over the time of \nthat prayer \n  \nIf the number of prayers is less than the prayers of a 24 hour day, \nthen he is obliged to do them before the present prayer. Included \nin this is the one who owes Dhuhr and 'Asr, or Maghrib and 'Isha', \nand only has enough time for the last. Nevertheless he must do \nthe first. If he does the present prayer first, then it is valid \nalthough it is a wrong action to do it intentionally rather than out \nof forgetfulness, and he does not have to repeat when the time has \ngone. Thus he does the missed prayers even if that entails missing \nthe current prayer. This is the well-known position. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he begins with the current \nprayer.  \n \n12.4e Several missed prayers  \n \nIf the numbers of prayers you have to make up is greater \nthan this and you are afraid that if you do them you will \nnot be able to do the prayer of the time you are in its time, \nyou should pray that prayer first \n  \nThen he begins to clarify the judgment of the order of several \nmissed prayers with the current prayer. It is if he misses, \naccording to what the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, five or \nmore, or according what Shaikh al-Maziri (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nstates, six or more. It is understood from his words that when he \ndoes not fear missing the current prayer, he begins with the \nomitted ones. This is the position of Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). The accepted is what Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related that he begins absolutely with the \ncurrent prayer, whether the time is narrow or wide, but it is \nobligatory when the time is short and recommended when it is \nwide. Then he moves to speak on the third category.  \n \n12.4f Remembering a missed prayer while praying  \n \nIf, while you are doing a prayer, you remember having \nmissed a previous prayer, the prayer you are doing \nbecomes invalid \n  \nIf he remembers a few prayers, which are those which must be in \norder with the current prayer while doing an obligatory prayer, \nthen the prayer becomes invalid and so he must stop it. It is not \nactually that it is invalid. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays that it means that it is obligatory to stop the prayer. This \nstatement is the literal position of the school as he said in at-\nTawdih. It is said that it is recommended. The famous position is \nwhat is in al-Mudawanna that he continues with the Imam and \nrepeats it, and there is disagreement about the obligation to \nrepeat the prayer, i.e. based on the fact the order between a few \nprayers and several ones is an obligation of the precondition. It is \nwell-known in al-Mukhtasar that he repeats it in the time, i.e. it is \nnot obligatory to repeat it in the time, but it is recommended.  \n \nIn short, when the Imam or the one praying alone remembers a \nfew missed prayers before performing one rak'at with its \nprostration‟s, he must stop. It is also said that it is desirable. If he \nhas performed one rak'at with its prostration‟s, it is recommended \nthat he make it double. It is said that it is obligatory. The one \nfollowing follows his Imam in that. There is no difference between \nfour and two, like Subh, Jumu'a, and the shortened prayer. The \nliteral meaning of the Mudawwana is that Maghrib is like the \nothers and he makes it double if he has done one rak'at. This is \nnot relied on. Rather he completes Maghrib. That is what Shaikh \nibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers. If he remembers it after \ncompleting two full rak'ats of Maghrib with their prostration, he \ncompletes it with the intention of the obligation. If the one \nfollowing remembers a few missed prayers, he continues with his \nImam. Then it is desirable for him to repeat it within the time. \nThere is no difference whether the repeated prayer is a Jumu'a or \nother and he repeats it as Jumu'a is possible. Otherwise it is \nDhuhr.  \n \n12.5 Invalidation of the Prayer in Certain Cases  \n \n12.5a Laughing  \n \nIf you laugh while doing a prayer you have to repeat the \nprayer  \n \nThis is laughing with sound. It is obligatory to repeat the prayer \nbecause it is invalid by agreement if it is deliberate, whether it be \nthe Imam, person following or individual. According to the well-\nknown position, it is the same if it is inadvertent or from being \novercome. Opposite it is the position that it does not impair it, \nbased on analogy with speech. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the literal meaning of his words would be even if \nhe laughs silently at what Allah azza wa jall promises the \nbelievers as when he reads an ayat which describes the people of \nthe Garden and laughs out of happiness.  \n \nBased on the well-known position about the inadvertent and being \novercome, the Imam should delegate someone and then become a \nfollower and then it is obligatory to repeat it after that within the \ntime. What is meant inadvertence forgetfulness, as when he \nforgets that he is doing the prayer.   \n \n12.5b Laughing does not break wudu'  \n \nbut you do not have to do wudu' again \n  \nThis differs from Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) who \nsays that laughing breaks wudu' as it invalidates the prayer \nexcept in the funeral prayer where it only invalidates the prayer. \nThe one following is different from the one alone and the Imam in \nsuch a case. \n  \n12.5c If you laugh behind an Imam  \n \nIf this happens when you are praying behind an Imam you \ncomplete the prayer with him but then do it again \nafterwards \n  \nIf someone laughs in a prayer behind an Imam, it is recommended \nthat he continue to observe the prayer. It is said that it is \nobligatory, and the one who follows continues limited by the first \nso he cannot leave while laughing, but is overcome. It is the same \nif he does it by forgetfulness. If he is able to leave, he does not \ncontinue. The second is that he did not laugh intentionally. \nOtherwise he does not continue in being overcome and \nforgetfulness afterwards. The third is that he does not fear by \ncontinuing that the will miss the time. Otherwise he stops. The \nfourth is that the laughter of those following, all or some, does not \noblige that it continue. Otherwise, he stops, even if he suspects \nthat. The fifth is that it is not Jumu'a. Otherwise he stops, even if \nthe time is ample.  \n \n12.5d Smiling  \n \nIf you merely smile no reparation is necessary \n  \nIf anyone praying only smiles while praying, he does not have to \nprostrate for forgetfulness nor does the prayer become invalid \nwhen it is intentional or done through ignorance, although it is \ndisliked to do it intentionally. If it is a lot, then the prayer is \ninvalidated, even if it is due to forgetfulness because the smile is \nthe movement of the lips and so it is like the movements of eyelids \nor feet. \n  \n12.5e Blowing  \n \nBlowing in the prayer incurs the same judgment as talking \n- if it is intentional it invalidates your prayer \n  \nIt invalidates it if it is deliberate and done by ignorance, but does \nnot when it is by a slight forgetfulness, and he prostrates after the \nsalam. It is not a precondition for the invalidation on account of \nblowing that two letters appear from him nor one letter. It is clear \nfrom that what is meant is blowing with the mouth. When it is \ndone with the nose, it does not invalidate the prayer, even if \nintentionally, and there is no prostration for its forgetfulness. The \nevidence for invalidation is what is related from Ibn 'Abbas \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) who said that blowing in the prayer is speech, \nand so it invalidates it.  \n \nIt is agreed that clearing the throat out of necessity does not \ninvalidate the prayer nor is there prostration for it. There are two \npositions about when it is not necessary by Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), which distinguish between the intentional \nand forgetful. The other statement is that it absolutely does not \ninvalidate it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes that \nposition and Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh \nal-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefer it since it is insignificant.  \n \nThe school is that the sigh on account of illness does not invalidate \nthe prayer, even though it is one of the sounds which are \nconnected to speech because it is the place of necessity. Shaikh \nBahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that. It is like that with weeping. When it is not \naccompanied with sound, it does not invalidate when it is used to \nhumility, i.e. it is a precondition that he be overcome. In short, \nwhat is connected to weeping is when it is without sound that it \ndoes not invalidate, whether it is by choice or being overcome by \nhumility or not unless there is a lot of volition in it. That which is \nhas sound invalidates, whether it is by humility or affliction if it is \nby choice. \n  \n12.5f Mistake about qibla  \n \nIf you make a mistake regarding the direction of qibla you \nshould do the prayer again if there is still time \n  \nThis refers to any of the people of ijtihad with evidence of the \ndirection of the Ka'ba. It includes the one who imitates someone \nelse of good reputation and knowledge, or a mihrab when he is \noutside of Makka or Madina and strives in the direction which he \nthinks is it since he has tokens of it. So he prays in that direction \nand then it becomes clear to him after he has finishes the prayer \nthat he was wrong about the direction of qibla, so that he had his \nback to qibla or deviated a lot from it. It is always recommended \nthat he repeat the prayer within the ikhtiyari time. If he prays \nwithout striving, then must repeat the prayer even if he gets it \nright.  \n \n12.5g If there is impurity on clothes or the place  \n \nThe same applies if you do the prayer in clothes with some \nimpurity on them or pray in an impure place \n  \nOr if there is impurity on the body and you then remember that \nimpurity after finishing the prayer, then the prayer is repeated in \nthe time. The time for Dhuhr is until yellowing and for Maghrib \nand 'Isha' it is the entire night.  \n \n12.5h Wudu' with unacceptable water  \n \nThe same also applies if you have done wudu' with water \nwhose color, taste, or smell has definitely changed, you \nmust do the prayer again however much time has elapsed \nand of course repeat your wudu' \n  \nIf he does this out of forgetfulness with impure water, which is \nthat which has changed, as a small amount of water into which \nsomething impure has fallen and not changed and he does not \nremember until he has finished his prayer. If he remembers it \nduring the prayer, then it is invalid simply by remembering it. \nThe recommendation is dependent on remembering it. His words \nare based on his school, which is that a little matter in which \nimpurity has fallen and has not changed is impure. The accepted \nposition is that it is not impure. On that basis, he does not have to \nrepeat it at all.  \n \n12.6 Joining prayers  \n \n12.6a Joining Maghrib and 'Isha'  \n \nYou are allowed to join Maghrib and 'Isha when there is \nheavy rain and also if the night is muddy and very dark \n  \nWhat he mentioned about joining on a rainy night is an \nindulgence upon which the author of the Mukhtasar proceeds, and \ndoes not make its judgment clear. Is it allowable, which is the \nliteral meaning of their words, but not the most appropriate which \nis the occurrence of the prayer in its time?  \n \nLinguistically allowance is to make easy. In the Shari‟ah it is to \npermit something forbidden when a preventative reason exists, i.e. \nif it were not for the existence of that difficulty, and the \npreventative reason here is that it can be done in its time. Part of \nwhat the author mentioned as a reason for joining is well-known, \nand it is rain. Rain is a reason for joining Maghrib and 'Isha' \naccording to the famous position provided that it is a lot of rain. It \nis that which causes average people to cover their heads, whether \nit falls or is about to fall which is known by the conditions. Snow \nand cold are similar to rain.  \n \nIt is agreed that another reason for joining is mud and darkness. \nWhat is meant is thick mud and darkness means a night without \nmoon. If the clouds cover the moon, then it is not darkness, and \nthe prayers are not joined for that. It is evident from the words of \nthe author that the prayers are not joined for darkness alone nor \nfor mud alone. That is the case. The people of the school agree that \nthe prayers are not joined for darkness alone. As for mud, Shaikh \nal-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) states that the well-known position \nthat they are not joined. To summarize, his position is that the \nallowance between Maghrib and 'Isha' is that only these two \nprayers can be joined. That is indeed the case. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that .  \n \n12.6b How joining is done: when it is done  \n \nWhen this is the case the adhan for Maghrib is called at the \nbeginning of the time outside the masjid. Then, according \nto Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), you should wait a \nlittle,  \n \nThe well-known position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is \nthat you wait a little. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) disagrees, but \nthis is the well-known position. Maghrib should be delayed a little \nso that those whose houses is far from the masjid can come to the \nmasjid.  \n \n12.6c The iqama for Maghrib of the joined prayers  \n \nthen call the iqama inside the masjid and do the prayer \n  \nAfter this short delay, it is sunnah to give the iqama for the \nprayer inside the masjid. It should not be long in the well-known \nposition because it should be shortened in other instances and so \nit is more appropriate here. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that joining should be intended in the first. There are \ntwo statements about when he delays it to the second, i.e. about \nwhether or not it is allowed. Both agree that the intention should \nbe with the first and the dispute is whether it is allowed when it is \nin the second, being obligatory that he intend it then. In short, its \nplace is the first and it is demanded of the Imam and the follower. \nIf the follower omits it, it is not invalid, and so it is obligatory, but \nnot a precondition. As for the intention of the Imam, it is \nnecessary. If the Imam omits the intention to be Imam, they are \ninvalid since it is omitted in them. If he leaves it in the second and \ndoes it in the first, the evident position is that it is sound and the \nsecond is invalid. He only prays it when the twilight vanishes. If \nhe omits it in the first and intends to join, it is invalid because its \nvalidity is dependent on the intention of being an Imam.   \n \n12.6d The adhan and iqama for 'Isha'  \n \nThen you call the adhan for 'Isha inside the masjid and do \nthe iqama and then do the prayer \n  \nThis is done after Maghrib is finished, without delay or \nglorification or praise or nafila. So there is no nafila between \nMaghrib and 'Isha' in the well-known position. The adhan for \n'Isha' is given after Maghrib. It is clear that this adhan is \nrecommended because it is not a group which needs another one. \nIt is inside the masjid so that people do not think that it is the \ntime of 'Isha' has come. After the adhan, the iqama is given and \nthe Imam leads the people in the prayer immediately. This is a \nprecondition for every joining, and it is not particular to joining on \na rainy night.  \n \n12.6e Leaving after the joining  \n \nThen everyone should leave while there is still some light \nleft in the sky \n  \nThey should leave after the prayer without delay. If they join and \ndo not leave until the twilight has gone, then they repeat 'Isha'. It \nis also said that they do not repeat it.  \n \n12.6f The second case of joining: 'Arafat  \n \nIt is an obligatory sunnah to join together Dhuhr and 'Asr \nat Arafat at midday with an adhan and an iqama for each \nprayer \n  \nThis is on the hajj. It is a confirmed sunnah. This question is dealt \nwith in the chapter on Hajj.  \n \n12.6g The third case of joining: at Muzdalifa  \n \nThe same applies to joining Maghrib and 'Isha on your \narrival at Muzdalifa \n  \ni.e. the same judgment as regards the sunnah and the adhan for \nMaghrib and 'Isha' applies at Muzdalifa. The author of the \nMukhtasar considered it to be recommended. The accepted \nposition is that it is sunnah. This is when it is possible to reach it. \nIf that is not possible due to illness or his mount, then he joins \nwhen the twilight departs when he stops with the Imam. The fiqh \nof the question is that the one going to Muzdalifa either stands \nwith the Imam or not. The obligation is that he stands with the \nImam. If he does not stand with the Imam as when he stands \nalone or does not stand at all, he prays every prayer in its proper \ntime.  \n \n12.6h The fourth case: joining when traveling  \n \nIf you are traveling hard you are permitted to join two \nprayers together; that is to pray Dhuhr at the end of its \ntime together with 'Asr at the beginning of its time and \nlikewise with Maghrib and 'Isha \n  \nThis is on an obligatory journey like the hajj and the commercial \njourney, whether the prayer is shortened in it or not. He is \npermitted to join two prayers whose time is shared, like Dhuhr \nand 'Asr, and Maghrib and 'Isha'. When midday catches him while \ntraveling and he intends to camp before sunset, he can join Dhuhr \nand 'Asr at the end the first time and the beginning of 'Asr.  \n \nThe description of joining Maghrib and 'Isha' the same as that of \njoining Dhuhr and 'Asr in that when sunset catches him and he \nintends to camp after dawn, he can join Maghrib and 'Isha' \nformally since he prays Maghrib near the vanishing of the twilight \nand prays 'Isha' at the beginning of its time because he will dawn \nhere is like sunset in respect of Dhuhr and 'Asr.  \n \n12.6i When starting out  \n \nIf you are starting your journey at the beginning of the \ntime of the first prayer you may also join the two prayers \ntogether then \n  \nAccording to the famous position, he can join before he sets out by \nputting the first of them at the beginning of the ikhtiyari time and \nthe other in its daruri time. This is the real joining. From this it is \nknown that the daruri time of 'Asr extends before and after it. The \nreal joining is not like this and is only done by someone with an \nexcuse in the form of a journey or something else. As for the \nformal joining, it is permitted for the one who has an excuse and \nothers. When he intends to camp before the sun yellows, he cannot \njoin. Rather he should pray Dhuhr before he travels and delay 'Asr \nuntil he stops, i.e. it is obligatory because he is able to put each \nprayer in its allotted time in the Shari‟ah. He can choose about the \n'Asr prayer. If he wishes he delays it until he stops. If he wishes, \nhe brings it forward if he intends to camp when the sun yellows.  \n \n12.6j Fifth case: sick people joining prayers  \n \nSick people are permitted to join the prayers if they are \nafraid, at the time or Dhuhr or Maghrib, that their sickness \nwill cause them to lose consciousness before the time of the \nnext prayer  \n \nThey can join prayers which share in the time in the well-known \nposition. Shaikh ibn Nafi' (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that each \nprayer should be prayed in its proper time. If they fear that they \nmight become unconscious at the second prayer, they can join. \nThis is at the beginning of the time of the first prayer according to \nthe well-known position. It is said that the first is at the end of its \ntime and the second at the beginning of its time. In the well-\nknown position, he joins Dhuhr and 'Asr at midday and Maghrib \nand 'Isha' at sunset. He joins at the beginning of the time because \nhe is afraid that he will become unconscious and that permits \njoining. It is like the fever which comes in fits, i.e. shakes, or \nvertigo which will come at the second time when he is sure of that.  \n \nNOTE: When he joins out of fear of being unconscious at the \nsecond time and then that is removed by being free of that, 'Isa \nsaid that he repeats the second prayer. Shaikh Sanad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he means within the time. The \nmost probable is that it is the daruri time. Shaikh ibn Sha'ban \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he does not repeat it, but that \nweak.  \n \n12.6j Second category Joining making it easier for the sick \nperson  \n \nIf joining the prayers makes things easier for someone \nsuffering from dysentery or a similar illness, he can do the \ntwo prayers together either in the middle of the time of \nDhuhr or when the redness in the sky fades after Maghrib  \n \nThis applies to all illnesses which make it difficult for him to rise \nfor every prayer. Then he can join two prayers whose time is \nshared, and so he joins Dhuhr and 'Asr in the middle of Dhuhr, \nand Maghrib and 'Isha' when the twilight fades. So Maghrib \noccurs at the end of its ikhtiyari time, based on its extending to \ntwilight and 'Isha' at the beginning of its ikhtiyari time.  \n \n \n12.7 Prayer missed because of an impediment  \n \n12.7a Prayers missed while unconscious  \n \nIf you faint you do not have to make up any prayers whose \ntime finishes while you are still unconscious. If you regain \nconsciousness, however, while there is still time to do at \nleast one rak’at you must make up that prayer \n  \nYou do not have to make up any prayers while you were \nunconscious. The same applies to the one who is intoxicated by \nsomething lawful, as when someone drinks wine thinking that it \nis milk or honey. The same applies to someone who is insane. This \nis while they are in that state, whether what he misses it is a lot \nor little, as opposed to Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nwho says that he makes up what is little, like five prayers or less. \nWhen you regain consciousness, you make up the prayer of the \ntime, meaning within the daruri time. It is sunset for Dhuhr and \n'Asr, and dawn for Maghrib and 'Isha' and sunrise for Subh.  \n \nHe clarifies the amount and says that the time in which he \nrecovers consciousness must be enough to perform one rak'at with \nits prostration‟s after obtaining what is necessary to perform the \nprayer, which is only purity from minor impurity in the accepted \nposition. When he faints and does not pray Dhuhr and 'Asr and \nthere remains enough of the day to pray five rak'ats after \npurification from impurity, he does not make it up because he was \nunconscious in their time. If he recovers consciousness and there \nremains enough of the day to pray five rak'ats after purification, \nhe makes them up because he was conscious in their time. If he \nfaints when he has not prayed Maghrib and 'Isha', and there \nremains of their time the amount of five rak'ats, he does not make \nthem up. If he becomes conscious for this amount, he makes them \nup. It is like that with the judgment in dropping and the making \nup when there remains four rakat‟s of Fajr because one considers \nthe excellence of one rak'at from the first. If there remains the \namount of three rak'ats of Fajr, 'Isha' falls and Maghrib remains \nhis responsibility.  \n \n12.7b When a menstruating woman becomes pure  \n \nThe same applies to a menstruating woman when she \nbecomes pure. If, after doing ghusl straight away, there is \nstill enough of the daytime left to do five rak'ats, she \nshould pray both Dhuhr and 'Asr \n  \nThen means when her period stops. The same applies to bleeding \nafter childbirth. She does not make up any prayer whose time has \npassed and performs a time sufficient for one rak'at or more \nremains after she has purified herself. The time in which she \npurifies herself is either day or night. In the day, it applies when \nshe becomes pure and after she has purified herself with water \nwhen tayammum is not obliged for her. Otherwise it is the \namount required for tayammum. In short purity is determined for \nher for more than what sufficient for a full rak'at with both \nprostration‟s. It is like all the excuses except for disbelief.  \n \n12.7c More about the menstruating woman  \n \nIf there is enough of the night left to do four rak'ats she \nshould pray both Maghrib and 'Isha. If there is less left of \nthe day or night than that she should only pray the second \nof the two prayers \n  \nThis is when she becomes pure at night. If, after she purifies \nherself, there is enough time for four rak'ats according to the \nposition of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) based on \nestimating Maghrib with three rak'ats and one rak'at for 'Isha'. \nThis is the determination for the woman at home and traveling \nwithout difference since there is no difference in the two night \nprayers between the resident and traveler.  \n \n12.7d When menstruation starts  \n \nIf a woman's period starts with these same amounts of time \nleft in the day or the night without her having done the \nprayers in question she does not have to make them up  \n \nThis is five rak'ats in the day and four in the night, whether she \ndelayed them out of forgetfulness or intentionally, and if she was \nrebellious in the deliberateness. If she menstruates and there \nremains of the day the amount of five rak'ats and she has not \nprayed Dhuhr and 'Asr, she does not make them up because she \nmenstruated in the time.  \n \n12.7e More about when menstruation starts  \n \nHowever, if it starts in the daytime when there is only time \nfor three rak'ats or less she should make up the first of the \ntwo prayers \n  \nIf it starts in the day when she has not prayed Dhuhr and 'Asr, or \nshe menstruates, and there still enough time for three rak'ats or \nless up to one, or she has not prayed Maghrib and 'Isha', she \nmakes up the first prayer which is Dhuhr in the first instance and \nMaghrib in the second because it came while she was pure and the \nsecond is omitted because she menstruated in its time. When the \ntime is short, then the last is singled out for being caught or \ndropped.  \n \n12.7f Another point on this  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion about the judgment if a \nwoman's period starts when there is enough of the night \nleft to pray four rak'ats. Some people say that the same \napplies and others say that since her period began in the \ntime of both prayers she does not have to make either of \nthem up \n  \nIt is said that the judgment is like when she menstruates when \nthere are three rak'ats of the night left: she makes up only the \nfirst prayer. That is stated by Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others, based on the calculating the \nsecond. Its reason is that when the time is short so that there is \nonly enough for one of the two prayers, then the obligation is the \nlast one. The other is that she does not make them up, and it is \nthe position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. It is the school since they \nbelieve that calculation in two prayers with a shared time is by \nthe first. Its reason is that the first of the two prayers must be \nadvanced before the other and that actually obliges calculation of \nit. Then he discusses things which oblige wudu'. \n \n12.8 Defects in wudu'  \n \n12.8a Certainty about wudu' but not about breaking it  \n \nIf you are sure that you have done wudu' but not sure \nwhether you have broken it or not since, you should make \nwudu' again \n  \nIt is obliged according the well-known position. The literal words \nof the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) are when doubt accompanies \ncertainty at the same time, which is impossible. So it is better to \nassume the \"then\" means \"and\" so he knows that the doubt is later \nthan certainty. What is meant is something which breaks wudu' in \ngeneral, whether that doubt is during the prayer or outside it, \nunless it arises in it after he has begun it feeling certain about \npurity. In such a case, he must continue in it and after he \ncompletes it is clear to him that he is still in purity he does not \nrepeat it. If it clear that he broke purity or he still has doubts, he \nis obliged to repeat it.   \n \n12.8b Miss out a fard aspect of wudu'  \n \nIf you remember missing out any fard aspect of wudu' soon \nafter finishing it, you do the thing you missed out and \nwhatever comes after it \n  \nThen he speaks about the judgment of someone who omits any \nfard aspect of the wudu' or one of its sunnah‟s. The first has four \ncategories because he either omits it intentionally or forgetfully, \nand each of them either remembers soon after or a long time after. \nThe second is also like that and so there are eight categories .  \n \nThe first is when he remembers that he did not wash a fard part, \nlike the face, hands to elbows, feet to the ankles, or wipe the head, \nand it is soon after, it is an obligation that he repeat that with the \nintention of completing wudu' because the fard is not removed by \nforgetfulness He must intend to complete wudu' in the well-known \nposition. Otherwise it is not adequate as Shaikh at-Tata'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) clearly states. When he does what he left \nout, it is recommended that he repeat what followed it to the end \nof wudu' for the sake of the proper order. Some commentaries say \nit is sunnah.  \n \nThere is disagreement about the definition of nearness. Shaikh \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) refers to custom in all that is \nnot defined by the Lawgiver. He says that its limit is as long as \nthe limbs have not dried within the normal time and the normal \nlimb and normal place. It is well-known.  \n \n12.8c Second category: if it is after a long time  \n \nIf some time has elapsed you just do the thing you missed \nout  \n \nWhen he remembers the forgotten things after the washed place is \ndry, he only does it three times with the intention immediately at \nthe time when he remembers. If he delays it a long time after he \nremembers it, his wudu' is invalid, even if he forgets, because he \ndoes not have the excuse of forgetting the second time in the \naccepted position. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat he repeats it.  \n \n12.8d Third category: Deliberate  \n \nexcept if you missed it out deliberately in which case you \nmust do the whole wudu' again \n  \ni.e. you deliberately missed out one of the fards of wudu', then it is \nobligatory to begin again if it is a long time since omitting \nwashing the washed limb or wiping the wiped limb. This is based \non the fact that doing it immediately is obligatory. It is to do \nwudu' in the same time without significant separation with \nremembrance and ability. It is the well-known position.   \n \n12.8e Fourth category: deliberate but not long  \n \nThe fourth category is when he intentionally omits that and not \nlong has passed: he repeats it and what is after it for the sake of \norder. There is no difference between the deliberate and forgetful \nwhen it is soon, but they differ after a long time. The forgetter \nbuilds, even if it is a long time, as opposed to when it is deliberate. \nIf a long time has passed, he starts wudu' .  \n \n12.8f If you have done the prayer  \n \nIf, in any of the above situations, you have already done \nthe prayer you must do it over again no matter how much \ntime has gone by having put right wudu' as necessary \n  \nIf he omits any fard element of his wudu' and then prays with that \nwudu', whether deliberate or by forgetfulness, soon or after a long \ntime, then he must always repeat the prayer because he prayed it \nwithout wudu'. But repeating wudu' is in the one category and it is \nwhen it is intentional and a long time has passed. \n \n12.8g Fifth category: omitting a sunnah element  \n \nIf you remember missing out something like rinsing out \nthe mouth or snuffing up water or wiping the ears and \nonly a short time has elapsed you should do the thing you \nmissed on its own \n  \nHe does not repeat what is after it in the school because the order \nbetween sunnah and fard is not obligatory.  \n \n12.8h The sixth: after a long time  \n \nIf a long time has passed you must do the thing you missed \nbefore doing any other prayers \n  \nIf he remembers what he forgot of the sunnah‟s of his wudu' after \na long time, he only does that which he forgot before any other \nprayers. As when he remembers after he has prayed Dhuhr, he \ndoes it for 'Asr if he is still in wudu'. So if he wants to pray 'Asr \nwith it, it is sunnah for him to do that omitted sunnah. Tawaf is \nlike the prayer. In short, if it is near, he does the omitted sunnah \nwhen he wants to remain in purity. If he does not want to pray or \ndo anything else and it is a long time, it is sunnah to do when he \nwants to pray or do tawaf. Length means that he has prayed with \nthat wudu' and its absence is that he has not prayed with it. That \nis explicitly stated by Shaikh ibn al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n12.8i Prayers already done  \n \nYou do not have to repeat any prayer you have already \ndone \n  \nWhen you pray with a wudu' in which a sunnah is forgotten, \nbecause it was done with certainty of purity and because the \nprayer is not invalidated by omitting one of the sunan of wudu', \neven if all of them are omitted. It is like that with the sunnah‟s of \nghusl. There is strong disagreement about the sunnah‟s of the \nprayer so that if he intentionally omits a sunnah intentionally, it \nis said that the prayer is invalid. It is said that it is because of the \nabsence of the sunnah element because the obligation is applied to \nits sunnah‟s, i.e. the prayer by the words of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam), \"Pray as you saw me pray.\" That is weak \nin respect of wudu' by the Holy Prophet‟s (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwords, \"Do wudu' as Allah has commanded you,\" i.e. He only \ncommanded four.  \n \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not speak about reversals, as \nwhen he puts the hands before the face, for instance. In short, the \none who reverses repeats only that part if he reverses by \nforgetfulness. Otherwise it is always desirable to repeat wudu' and \nthe prayer within the time and elsewhere. When time is short, \nthere is no difference between it being deliberate or forgetful. He \nrepeats what was reversed three times by the sunnah in following \nit in the Shari‟ah, one each times is not desirable. \n  \n12.8j Impurity on the mat  \n \nIf a mat has some impurity on it but you do the prayer on a \npart which is pure your prayer is valid \n  \nIf whatever you pray on has an impurity, wet or dry, whether or \nnot it moves when he moves, he does not have to repeat the prayer \nbecause it is not invalid so that it would need to be repeated. He is \nasked to purify the place which his limbs touch. This is opposed to \nthe turban whose end hangs on the ground where there is \nimpurity: his prayer is invalid by agreement if the impurity moves \nwith it.  \n \n12.8k A dispensation  \n \nThere is no harm in a sick man putting down a thick cloth \nwhich is pure over his bedding which has impurity on it \nand then doing the prayer on that \n  \nIt is a precondition that the garment on which he reclines is \nseparate from the place of prayer. Otherwise the prayer is invalid. \nIt is also a precondition that it be thick and not thin. It clear from \nthis that the healthy person has no excuse to do that, and that is \nexplicit in the  text of the Mudawwana. It is said that that is \ngeneral to the sick and healthy person and Shaikh ibn Yunus \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is correct.  \n \n12.9 The Prayer of a sick person  \n \n12.9a If he is unable to stand  \n \nIf a sick man cannot pray standing up  \n \nIf a person cannot stand upright to recite all of the Fatiha on his \nown or leaning on someone else other than someone in janaba or \nmenstruating or it will entail great hardship. If he is ill, then he is \neither unable to stand at all, or fears he will become ill, or it will \nincrease, or there will be great hardship with the precondition \nthat he is ill, not that he is healthy. If he is healthy, the hardship \nmentioned does not permit him not to stand and make it \npermissible for him to pray sitting. The obligation to stand \nindependently is in the state of doing obligatory elements, like \nruku', tahrim and reciting the Fatiha for other than the one \nfollowing, and not for the one following. If the one following leans \non a pillar while it is recited such that if it were to be removed, he \nwould fall, is prayer is still valid as is the case absolutely in the \nreciting the sura, i.e. for one praying alone, an Imam or one \nfollowing, as is confirmed by the one who knows and does not pay \nattention to what was said other than that. Some commentators \nare mislead by the literal expression.  \n \n12.9b The sick person prays as best he can  \n \nhe should pray sitting down, cross-legged if possible; if not \nthen to the best of his ability \n  \nOn his own in the well-known position, i.e. it is not valid for him \nto be Imam either for those ill or healthy, even those like him. \nThat is what some of them state, but that is weak. The accepted \nposition is that the Imam should be healthy for those who are \nhealthy. It is best that he sit cross-legged in the place of standing, \nif he is able to do so. This is on the basis that sitting is a \nsubstitute for standing. It is said that he sits as he sits for the \ntashahhud, and the later people prefer that. According to the first, \nhe alters his sitting between the two prostration‟s, as in the \ntashahhud. Similarly, it is the best in respect of nafila prayers to \nsit cross-legged since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nthat. Otherwise he sits as best he can, and it is desirable but not \nobligatory that there be an order between it and being cross-\nlegged.  \n \n12.9c Gestures for prostration and bowing  \n \nIf he is not able to go into sujud he should make a gesture \nof going into ruku' and sujud, making what he does for \nsujud lower than what he does for ruku' \n  \nIf the sick person cannot sit, he indicates prostration by bowing. If \nhe is unable to it altogether or there will be great hardship in \ngoing so, he indicates by his head and back, i.e. must indicate with \nthem. If he cannot do it with his back, he indicates with his head, \nIf he cannot do that, then he indicates as he can, and places his \nhand on his knees when he indicates bowing. When he rises, he \nraises them. When he indicates prostration, he places his hands \non the earth and when he rises from it, he places them on his \nknees. It is recommended that his prostration be lower than his \nbowing. Some say that it is obligatory. It is understood from the \nwords of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the Mudawwana. It \nis also understood from some of the commentators on Shaikh \nKhalil (rahmatullahi alaihi). When you know that, then the \njudgment that it is recommended is weak. It is disliked for the one \nwho gestures to lift anything on which he prostrates. If he does \nthat he does not repeat his prayer, whether he does that \nintentionally or out of ignorance. This is when he intends the \nearth by his indication. If he intends that what he lifts is not the \nearth, it is not permitted, as Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said.  \n \n12.9d If he is unable to sit  \n \nIf he cannot sit he should pray lying on his right side \nmaking gestures to indicate the various positions \n  \nIf he cannot sit on his own or supported or cross-legged or \notherwise, he prays on side with his face towards qibla as he \nwould be in the grave. If he cannot go on his right side, then on his \nleft side.  \n \n12.9e If he can only lie on his back  \n \nIf he is unable to do anything but lie on his back he should \npray in that position \n  \nIf he can only pray on his back, he gestures with his feet to qibla. \nIf he is unable to pray on his back, he prays lying on his stomach \nwith his face to qibla and his feet behind him. The judgment about \nfacing qibla in those states is that it is obligatory when he has the \nability to do so. If he prays to other than the qibla when he is able \nto face it, the prayer is invalid. The ability is when there is \nsomeone who is able to move him. If he finds someone to move him \nafter the prayer, it is recommended that he repeat it within the \ntime.  \n \nThe one who prays lying down indicates with his head. If he is \nunable to indicate with his head, he indicates with his eyes and \neyebrows. If he cannot do this, then it is with his finger. The \nliteral text as Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said is that \nthe order in the gesture using these three is obligatory.  \n \n12.9f The prayer should not be delayed  \n \nAs long as he is in his right mind he should not delay the \nprayer and do it as best as he is able  \n \nThis means he does not omit it, and he should pray as best he can, \nstanding, sitting, indicating and lying down. The sick person prays \naccording to his ability, even only with the intention of its actions, \nif he is unable to indicate with a limb or something else. He \nintends its pillars with his heart so that he intends tahrim, \nrecitation, bowing, rising and prostration, etc. of the actions of the \nprayer.  \n \n12.9g Tayammum  \n \nIf a sick man cannot use water because doing so would be \nharmful to him or because he cannot get anyone to bring \nhim any, he should do tayammum. If he cannot find anyone \nto bring him earth, he should do tayammum using the wall \nat his side provided that it is made of clay or covered with \nclay. However if the wall is covered with plaster or \nwhitewash it cannot be used for tayammum \n  \nWhen the one who must perform the prayer is unable to use \nwater, then he does tayammum. If no one brings him earth, he can \nuse the wall if it clay, or covered with clay. So he can do \ntayammum with earth brought to him. It is also understood that \nhe only uses the wall for tayammum when there is no earth. That \nis different from the School. The School is that it is permitted to do \ntayammum with the wall when there is earth, but it is desirable \nthat he not do tayammum with it except when there are is no \nearth. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar said \nthat it is like earth, and it is best. In short, the sick person or \nhealthy person is permitted to do tayammum on the unbaked \nbrick wall and the stone wall, even if he finds earth when there is \nno barrier to prevent him touching it. If the wall is covered with \nsomething manufactured, it is not used. Shaikh az-Zabidi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it.  \n \n12.10 The prayer while mounted  \n \n12.10a In case of mud which prevents prostration  \n \nIf the prayer becomes due while you are traveling and you \ncannot find anywhere to pray because of mud, you should \nget off your riding animal and do the prayer standing up, \nmaking the motion you do for sajda lower than the one for \nruku' \n  \n When you are traveling and the ikhtiyari time is short, as it says \nsome of the commentaries on Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand the commentary of Shaikh at-Tata‟i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nThe best time is that in which it is ikhtiyari or daruri. If it is light \nmud, and he despairs of getting out of it in the ikhtiyari or daruri \ntime and he is able to dismount, but cannot find any place to pray \nbecause of soiling his clothes or flood on the road, then he \ndismounts and prays standing, bowing for ruku' and prostration. \nHe indicates ruku' by partially bowing his chest. If he touches his \nknees, for instance, which is a full ruku', then he bows in fact and \nhis indication of prostration is lower than ruku'. When he \nindicates ruku', he places his hands on his knees and when he \nrises he lifts them from them. When he indicates prostration, he \nindicates the earth with his hands and intends to sit between the \ntwo prostration‟s standing, and the same with the sitting of the \ntashahhud. While standing, he separates the standing and sitting \nwith an intention. As for the one who thinks it probable that he \nwill get out of it before the end of the time, he delays it to the end \nof the time.  \n \n12.10b The necessity of praying mounted  \n \nIf there is so much mud that you cannot even dismount you \nshould do the prayer on your riding animal facing qibla \n  \ni.e. the place where he would alight from his mount. He prays by \nindication, but if he cannot dismount out of fear of sinking, he \nprays on his mount towards qibla. The prayer on the animal is \nonly permitted by fear of sinking. Fear of getting his clothes dirty \ndoes not oblige the validity of the prayer on the animal. It is \npermitted to pray by indication on land. It is the same, for \ninstance, if he prays on the animal facing qibla when there is no \nmud and he fears to dismount because of thieves or wild animals. \nThen he can pray on his animal and indicate ruku' and prostration \nthe earth and he lifts his turban from his forehead when he \nindicates prostration. He does not prostrate on the saddle or \nanything else. He sits cross-legged if he can. The judgment of the \nresident is like the traveler when the time finds him in deep mud.  \n \n12.10c Nafila prayers while on the move  \n \nA traveler can do nafila prayers on the move while seated \non his riding animal no matter what direction the animal \nis going in,  \n \nIf he is riding on his back or in a sedan or something else. But he \nmust be riding normally. The literal words of the author would \nmean whether or not he is facing qibla when he begins the prayer, \nas opposed to the text of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthat he turns his animal to qibla first and then says the ihram \nand then prays wherever it turns. The school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) permits that at night and day as opposed to \nibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), who does not allow the traveler to \ndo nafila in the day.  \n \nHe should be seated cross-legged if possible and lift his turban \nfrom his forehead in prostration He can hit and kick the animals, \nbut should not speak nor look around. The traveler rather than \nthe resident is mentioned. The walker does not do nafila in his \njourney walking. He said, \"No matter what observe direction the \nanimal is going\" excludes someone on a ship, He does not do nafila \non it except towards qibla, and turns with it wherever it turns if \nhe can do that. The basis in what he mentioned is that is \nconfirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed on \na camel in any direction it turned, and did the witr on it, i.e. nafila \nand not the obligatory prayers. \n \n12.10d Proviso about the journey  \n \nprovided that he is on a journey for which the prayer can \nbe shortened \n  \ni.e. the precondition of the traveler doing nafila on the animal \nwherever it turns is that the journey is one in which the prayer \ncan be shortened. If it is a less shorter than that or a journey \nwhich involves disobeying Allah azza wa jall, that is not the case.  \n \n12.10e Praying the witr mounted  \n \nHe can also do the witr mounted if he wants \n  \nWith the previous preconditions. If he wants, he performs the witr \non the ground, which is preferable.  \n \n12.10f Fard prayers while traveling  \n \nHowever fard prayers, even in the case of illness, should \nonly be done on the ground unless the illness is such that \ngetting off the animal would mean that the sick person was \nforced by his illness to do the prayer sitting down using \ngestures. In this case he should pray on his animal after it \nhas been brought to a halt and made to face qibla \n  \nEven if the traveler is ill he can only pray on the earth by the \nevidence of the precious hadith. However, if he is so ill he can only \nperform prostration and bowing with gestures, then he can pray \non the animal. In the Mukhtasar there is permission without \ndislike. In the Mudawwana it is disliked. It is limited by the \ndirection he faces with his animal. If he stops and faces qibla and \nprays, there is no dislike. This qualification is transmitted by \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) from the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He said that what is in the Risala qualifies \nwhat is in the Mudawwana.  \n \n12.11 Nosebleeds  \n \n12.11a Stopping for a nosebleed \n  \nIf you have a nosebleed when you are praying behind an \nImam you should go out and wash off the blood  \n \nYou leave to wash off the blood from the nose, holding the nose \nfrom the top if you does not suspect that it will last to the need of \nthe preferred time. If you think that it will last to the end of the \npreferred time, you complete the prayer and do not go out, even if \nthe blood is flowing if you are not in a masjid, or in a masjid if you \nhave spread out something to catch the blood, or it is pebbles or \nearth with no mat on it because that is due to necessity. You wash \naway the blood when you finish. If he is in a carpeted or tiled \nmasjid, and you fear you will soil it, even less than a dirham, you \nmust stop.   \n \n12.11b Resuming the prayer  \n \nand then return and complete the prayer as long as you \nhave not spoken or stepped on any impurity \n  \nAfter washing the blood off, you complete the prayer because the \nfaqih speaks about independent judgments and the prayer is not \nstopped \nin \nthe \nfamous \nposition. \nShaikh \nibn \nal-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the best is to stop. The basis of the \nfamous position is the action of the majority of the Companions \nand Tabi'un. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \nprayer is invalid based an emergence of impurity which breaks \nwudu'. We said that it there is building on what was done. That \nhas six preconditions of which two are indicated when he \nmentioned not speaking or stepping on impurity.  \n \n12.11c Preconditions: 1. Not speaking  \n \nIt is clear that speaking invalidates it if he speaks at all: \ndeliberately, out of ignorance or forgetfulness.  \n \n12.11d Preconditions: 2. Not stepping on impurity  \n \nThe second precondition is clear because it is evident that it \ninvalidates if he steps on impurity at all, whether wet or dry. If it \nis wet it is agreed that it invalidates. If it is dry, like a skin, it is \nlike that according to Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi). As for \nthe droppings and urine of animals, he continues when he steps on \nthem by agreement because roads are not free of that in general. \nShaikh al-Hattab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"He must qualify \nwhat he steps on forgetfully or by necessity for that is by its \ngenerality and spread over the road. As for walking on it \ndeliberately without excuse when the road is wide and it is not \nuniversal and there is a possibility of stepping over it, then it \nmust invalidate his prayer by the negation of the cause which is \nnecessary.  \n  \n12.11e Preconditions: 3. Proximity of water  \n \nThe third precondition is that he does not go pass water which is \nnear to other water.   \n \n12.11f Preconditions: 4. Not turning one's back on qibla  \n \nThe fourth is that he does not turn his back on qibla for other than \nseeking water. As for the seeking water, that does invalidate.   \n \n12.11g Preconditions: 5. The blood drips or flows  \n \nThe fifth is that the blood drips or flows and does not splatter. If it \nonly leaks without flowing or dripping, he does not leave to wash \nit.  \n \n12.11h Precondition: 6. It is in a group prayer  \n \nThe sixth is that the nosebleed occurs in the group prayer, \nwhether he is an Imam or follower. As for the one on his own, \nthere are two famous statements about building on it, which \nderive from whether the allowance of building is for the respect of \nthe prayer, which prevents its invalidation, or is to obtain the \nbenefit of the group.  \n \n12.11i Discounting partially completed rak'ats  \n \nYou should discount any partial rak'at you have already \nprayed unless you completed its two sajdas \n  \nIt is not counted as a rak'at if it has not been completed with its \ntwo sajdas according to what is transmitted from Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that he builds on it, be it a little or a lot. That is in the \nfirst rak'at or others. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) deduced that according to the transmission of Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), if he has a nosebleed after ruku' \nand before prostration or after one prostration, that is void and he \nbegins with the recitation.  \n \n12.11j When the bleeding is slight  \n \nIf there is only a little blood you should not leave the \nprayer but staunch the blood with your fingers except if it \nis pouring out or dripping \n  \nYou staunch it with the ends of the fingers of the left hand, and \nthe manner of staunching it is to first with the end of the thumb \nand the little finger, then the finger next to the little finger, then \nthe middle finger and then the index finger. This is unless it is \npouring out or dripping. In such a case, he does not staunch it, but \ngoes for water.   \n \n12.11k Breaking off a prayer because of vomiting or \nbreaking wudu'  \n \nYou may not, however, complete a prayer in this way if you \nhave to leave it because of vomiting or breaking wudu' \n  \n Absolutely, whether intentional or inadvertent, i.e. vomiting \nsomething impure which leaves him in the state of the prayer, \neven if a little, and the same holds true for vomiting a lot of what \nis pure. The upshot is that the prayer is not invalidated by the \npure provided that it a little and comes out usually. When it is \nimpure, even if a little, or a lot of the pure, or vomited \ndeliberately, then the prayer is invalid. The same holds true if he \nintentionally swallows it. The case is that it comes out usually. If \nhe swallows it usually in that case, there are two equal statements \nabout his prayer being invalid neither of which are preferred. That \nis not the case in the inadvertent.  \n \n12.11l When the nosebleed coincides with the salam  \n \nIf your nosebleed starts after the Imam has said the salam, \nyou say the salam and then leave the prayer-line, but if it \nstarts just before the Imam says the salam you should go \nout, wash off the blood, come back, sit down, and then say \nthe salam \n  \nIt is permitted for him to say the salam while he has the impurity \nbecause it is easier than going for water. If it is before the salam of \nthe Imam, he goes for water because if he does not leave, he \ndeliberately carries impurity in his prayer while some of it still \nremains. Then he returns and sits and repeats the tashahhud if he \nhas said it in the well-known position. If he has not said it, there \nis no dispute that he says it. His words would seem to mean that \nhe leaves to wash off the blood, even if the salam of the Imam was \nafter his nosebleed. That is not the case, If the salam of the Imam \nwas close to his nose-bleed, he says the salam and goes and his \nprayer is allowed, as in the question before it. He no longer owes \nany actions of the prayer which would have to be restored. Then \nhe goes on to make clear where the one with a nosebleed ends his \nprayer after washing off the blood with the previous preconditions.  \n \n12.11m Where to finish the prayer  \n \nIf there is no chance of catching the end of the prayer with \nthe Imam, you can complete the prayer in your house  \n \nIf he is in a group, he can complete it in his house where he \nwashed off he blood if he can or the nearest place in which he can \npray if he despairs - or thinks it probable that he will not catch the \nprayer. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said if he hopes to \ncatch any of the prayer with the Imam, even the salam, he returns \nto it. It is like that also in Mudawwana and elsewhere. Shaikh ibn \nSha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi) said if he does not hope to catch a \nrak'at, he complete the place. What was said about completing the \nprayer in any place is general to all prayers except one: Jumu'a.  \n \n12.11n If it happens in Jumu'a  \n \nexcept in the case of Jumu'a when you must complete it in \nthe masjid \n  \nThis is when he catches one rak'at with the Imam with its \nprostration‟s. He must also return if he thinks that he will catch a \nrak'at with the Imam after he returns, even if he did not catch a \nrak'at with him before the nosebleed. If he does not catch a rak'at \nbefore the nosebleed nor think that he will catch it after he \nreturns to the Imam, he does not return. He begins Dhuhr with \nihram. If he builds on his ihram, and prays four, then it is evident \nthat it is sound as Shaikh al-Hattab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \nHe must complete it in the masjid in which he began it, even if he \nthinks that the Imam has finished because the masjid is a \nprecondition for the validity of Jumu'a and it is not complete in its \ncourtyard, even if he begins there because of lack of space or \njoining the rows, as Shaikh al-Hattab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nconcludes. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat it is valid to complete it in the courtyard. Those who oblige \ncompleting it in the masjid in which he began it does not oblige \nthe exact place in which he prayed with the Imam. It is enough \nthat it is any place in it because otherwise would lead to a lot of \naction and a lot of it invalidates the prayer. If he prays in a masjid \nother than the one in which he prayed, his prayer is invalid, even \nif it is closer to him. It is clear from his words that he only \ncompletes it in the masjid, whether there is an impediment or not \nbetween him and returning to it. That is the well-known position, \nand accordingly, if something comes between him and the masjid \nin which he began it before he completes the prayer, then his \nJumu'a is invalid  \n \nAfter speaking on the nosebleed, he speaks on an earlier question \nin the chapter of purity because it is appropriate to this question.  \n \n12.12 Purity after a Nosebleed  \n \n12.12a A small amount of blood on clothes  \n \nIf there is a small amount of blood on your clothes you \nshould wash it off but you do not have to repeat the prayer \n  \nIt is a recommendation which is the agreed position since it is \nstated that blood is overlooked. Washing it refers to also to the \nbody and the place. Shaikh ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat the author meant the recommendation and so it means that \nthis is desirable and not obligatory. This is the school of the \nMudawwana , i.e. about washing off a small amount of blood, not \na large amount is recommended in the school of the Mudawwana, \ni.e. it is confirmed. This is known that the school of the \nMudawwana recommends washing off a little, not a lot. It is \ndiffers from what Shaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said about \nthe school of the Mudawwana being that it is obligatory to wash \noff a small amount of blood.  \n \n12.12b A large amount of blood  \n \nYou only have to repeat the prayer if there is a large \namount of blood \n  \nThere is a well-known disagreement about its definition and the \ndefinition of a lot. It is said that a lot in according to custom, and \nit is said that it is not. The well-known position is that a lot is the \nsize of the Baghli dirham. So whatever covers the area of the \nBaghli dirham is a lot. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nindicated that in al-'Utbiya. Shaikh ibn Sabiq (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said a that a small amount is less than a dirham and a lot \nis more than it. The position of the author is that he does not \nrepeat it, meaning within the time if he prays forgetting about it. \nIf he prays with it deliberately, he always repeats it according to \nthe position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). That is \nbecause Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is \nobligatory to remove impurities, and blood is one of them. This is \ncontrary to what is transmitted by the author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) of the Bayan that the well-known position is the \ntransmission of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that removing the impurity is \nsunnah. Impurities other than blood have a different judgment \naccording to the disagreement between a little, which is \noverlooked and a lot, which is not. Fearing that someone might \nimagine otherwise, he says:  \n \n12.12c Other impurities  \n \nWith any other impurity it is immaterial whether the \namount is small or large, you have to repeat the prayer in \nany case \n  \nA small amount of any other impurity must be removed and the \nprayer always repeated when he prays it deliberately wearing an \nimpure garment, and in the time if he prays it forgetfully or by \ninability. The difference between blood and other impurities is \nthat blood cannot be guarded against because the body of man is \nlike a vessel filled with blood as opposed to other impurities which \ncan generally be avoided.  \n \n12.12d Blood from insect bites  \n \nYou do not have to wash off the blood which comes from \ninsects bites except if it is excessive \n  \nBecause washing it is great hardship and extra imposition since \nman is almost never without a little blood, which is overlooked. \nExcessive means more than normal: then it is recommended to \nwash it. It is said that it is obligatory and the definition of \nexcessive is that when it reaches a point at which he would be \nembarrassed by among people.  \n \n \n \nChapter Thirteen: On the sajdas of the Holy \nQur'an \n \n \nThe prostration‟s of the Holy Qur'an are sunnah. The decision of \nShaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) is the preferred. It is said \nthat they are meritorious. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and others said that it is well-known for the reciter and the \none who intends to listen, not the one who hears it. \n  \n13.1 Preconditions  \n \nThere are three preconditions for the prostration of the listener.  \n \nThe reciter is fit to be Imam, i.e. he is a sane, adult male in wudu'. \nHe does not prostrate when he hears an ayat of prostration recited \nby a hermaphrodite, woman, child, or someone not in wudu'. \n  \nThe listener is sitting to learn from the reciter what he needs of \nrecitation in idgham or memorization of what is recited.  \n \nThe reciter has not sat so that people can listen to the excellence \nof his recitation. He has sat to recite the words of Allah azza wa \njall or intends to let people listen for the sake of admonition and \npreventing acts of disobedience.  \n \nWhen these preconditions exist, and the reciter does not prostrate, \nthe one who intends to listen prostrates according to the well-\nknown position.  \n \n13.2 Verses where prostration is made  \n \nThere are eleven sajdas in the Holy Qur'an, these being the \nplaces where you are commanded to go into sujud. None of \nthese are in the Mufassal .  \n \nThey are called 'aza'im in Arabic to encourage that it be done out \nof fear of abandoning them which is disliked. The Mufassal are \nthose frequently separated by the basmala, the first of which is al-\nHujurat (Holy Qur‟an 49), according to some. So there is no \nprostration in an-Najm, al-Inshiqaq (Holy Qur‟an 84), and al-\nQalam (Holy Qur‟an 68).  \n \nThe first is:  \n \n1. In Surat al-A'raf, (Holy Qur’an 7:206) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (And they glorify Him and to Him they \nprostrate) which is the end of the sura.  \nIf you are doing the prayer you should go into sujud when \nyou reach this point and then recite what is easy for you \nfrom Surat al-Anfal or some other sura and then go into \nruku' and sujud.  \n \nIf you are doing a prayer, whether nafila or obligatory and recite \nit, then you prostrate for it at the moment of respect because it is \nsubject to the prayer. It is disliked to intentionally recite an ayat \nof prostration in an obligatory prayer. After prostrating, it is \nrecommended that you stand and recite some of al-Anfal or \nanother which is easy, then do ruku' as normal so that it is not \nimmediately after prostration.  \n \nThe rest are:  \n \n2. In Surat ar-Ra'd (Holy Qur’an 13:15) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (...and their shadows in the morning and the \nafternoon).  \n \n3. In Surat an-Nahl (Holy Qur’an 16:50) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (They fear their Lord above them and do what \nthey are ordered to do.)  \n \n4. In Surat al-Isra (Holy Qur’an 17:109) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (They fall on their faces weeping and it \nincreases them in humility.)  \n \n5. In Surat Maryam (Holy Qur’an 19:58) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (When the signs of the Rahman are recited to \nthem they fall down prostrating and weeping.)  \n \n6. In Surat al-Hajj (Holy Qur’an 22:18) where Allah azza wa \njall says: (Whomever Allah abases no one can ennoble. \nSurely Allah does what He wills.)  \n \n7. In Surat al-Furqan (Holy Qur’an 25:60) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (Should we prostrate to what you order us to \nprostrate to? And it makes them run even further away.)  \n \n8. In Surat an-Naml (Holy Qur’an 27:26) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (There is no god except Him, the Lord of the \nMighty Throne.)  \n \n9. In Surat as-Sajda (Holy Qur’an 32:15) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (They glorify their Lord with praise and they \nare not proud.)  \n \n10. In Surat Sad (Holy Qur’an 38:24) where Allah azza wa \njall says: (He sought forgiveness from His Lord and fell \ndown bowing and turned to His Lord in repentance.) It is \nalso said that this sajda is done after the words. (...an \nexalted place with Us and an excellent return.) (Holy \nQur’an 38:25)  \n \n11. In Surat Fusillat (Holy Qur’an 41:37) where Allah azza \nwa jall says: (And prostrate to Allah who created them if it \nis indeed Him you worship.)  \n \n13.3 How the prostration is done  \n \n13.3a You must be in wudu'  \n \nYou do not do these sajdas in the Holy Qur'an unless you \nare in wudu'.  \n \nA Precondition for it is what is preconditional for the other \nprayers: purity from both major and minor impurity and facing \nqibla.  \n \n13.3b The takbir  \n \nYou say a takbir for them  \n \nIn going down and coming up by agreement if that is while he is in \nthe prayer, and in the well-known statement, if he is not in the \nprayer. It is said that it is disliked and it is said that he can \nchoose between the takbir or not doing it. Then there are three \npositions. He does not raise his hands, which is disliked in going \ndown and rising. There is no tashahhud in the well-known \nposition. It is also said that there is a tashahhud.  \n \n13.3c No salam  \n \nbut do not say the salam  \n \nThere is no salam, i.e. it is disliked unless he intends to remove \nany dispute.  \n \n13.3d The takbir on rising \n  \nThere is leeway as to whether you say 'Allahu Akbar' as \nyou come up from the sajda although we consider it \npreferable to do so.  \n \nIt a fourth position in the question in which Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) relates three positions, i.e. he has a choice \nwhen he rises, but not when he does down, as Shaikh ibn Naji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) pointed out. Do his words, 'Whether you say \n'Allahu Akbar' although we consider it preferable' refer to the \ntakbir when rising? i.e. does it mean that he says the takbir when \nrising as he does when going down so that it is the same as the \nfirst of the three positions, or does the takbir refer to rising and \ngoing down which is also the first? So in any case he chooses the \nwell-known position.  \n \n13.4 When to do or omit the prostration  \n \n13.4a In the prayers  \n \nYou should do these sajdas, if you recite the ayats where \nthey come, in both fard and nafila prayers \n  \nThese prostration‟s are done in the fard and nafila prayers, \nwhether you are the Imam or praying alone, even if it is disliked \nto recite them intentionally in the fard prayer in the well-known \nposition. It is disliked for the Imam and someone praying alone to \nrecite the prostration ayat deliberately in the fard because if he \ndoes not prostrate, he enters into the threat, and if he prostrates, \nhe increases the prostration over the obligation and that might \nlead to confusing those following. As for the nafila, it is not \ndisliked to intentionally recite the prostration ayat in them alone \nor in a group, out loud or secretly, resident or on a journey, at \nnight or day, confirmed or not confirmed, fearing to confuse the \none behind him or not.  \n \nNOTE ONE: Part of what he says about the fard and nafila is \nthat if he recites them in a khutba he does not prostrate. It is said \nthat is since there is no space in it in the order of the khutba and \nthe judgment is that reciting it is disliked. If it occurs that he \nprostrates in the khutba, it is not invalid, even if he is forbidden to \nprostrate.  \n \nNOTE TWO: If an Imam recites a prostration ayat and does not \nprostrate, then the follower leaves it. If the follower prostrates \nwhen his Imam has not done so, his prayer is invalid when that is \ndeliberate rather than inadvertent, as the prayer of the follower is \nnot invalid by not prostrating with the Imam who prostrates, even \nif he leaves it deliberately - but he has behaved badly. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that it is not disliked to recite \nit in the fard. Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn \nYunus (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn Bashir (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and others say that is correct since it is confirmed that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) continued to recite the \nprostration ayat in the first rak'at of the Subh prayer on Jumu'a. \nShaikh ibn Bashir (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Our excellent \nShaikhs and theirs used to persevere on that, and it is done at any \ntime of day or night except the Friday khutba, sunrise, when it \nbecomes yellow and daybreak. It is disliked to do it at these times. \nThere is disagreement about doing it at daybreak and yellowing \nafter praying Subh and after praying 'Asr. In the Muwatta' it is \nabsolutely not allowed after them, either in yellowing or daybreak. \nIn the Mudawwana, it is the accepted position that he can \nprostrate after it after them as long as it is not yellow or \ndaybreak. This is what the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) says.  \n \n13.4b At times when prayer is forbidden  \n \nYou should also do them if you recite any of these ayats \nafter praying Subh, provided the light is not yet bright, \nand after 'Asr provided the sun has not turned yellow \n  \nThis is a confirmed sunnah. Thus it resembles funerals. and there \nis a difference between the one who does them in the two times \nbecause of it being confirmed sunnah because the simple nafila \nare not done after 'Asr and after Subh.  \n \n \n \nChapter Fourteen: On Traveling Prayers \n \n \nIts judgment is that it is sunnah. Its reason is the journey and its \nplace is the four rak'ats prayer. One of its preconditions, which are \nfour, is the distance. It deals with of what invalidates shortening \nand questions connected to it. He indicated the first five which are \nthe description of the travel prayer and its judgment, reason, \nplace and some of its preconditions. \n  \n14.1 Travel which requires shortening the prayer  \n \n14.1a The distance  \n \nIf you travel a distance of four mail stages which is forty-\neight miles, you should shorten the prayer  \n \nThis is when you intend to make a land or sea journey which is \nobligatory, like the obligatory hajj, or desirable, like voluntary \nhajj, or permitted, like for commerce, of at least four mail stages. \nThis definition indicates the distance, and in terms of time, the \nprayer is only shortened in a journey of a day and a night by \nanimals carrying normal burdens. If he shortens before that, it is \nsaid that if it is 35 miles, he always repeats it, and in 40 he does \nnot repeat. There is some disagreement about whether he repeats \nit within the time or not. Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid in at-Tawdih that he always repeats for shortening the \nprayer in 36 miles in the school. The prayer which is shortened is \nthe obligatory prayer and the prayer which is being made up.  \n \n14.1b The number of rak'ats  \n \ndoing only two rak’ats for each except in the case of \nMaghrib which is not shortened \n \nMaghrib is odd and cannot be divided. It is also because it makes \nthe number of prayers in the day odd. Subh is not shortened \nbecause it is not established in the Shari‟ah that it is shortened, \nwhich would make it one rak'at. He is silent about Subh because it \nis not shortened. So there is consensus that Subh and Maghrib are \nnot shortened and so the journey has no effect on them.  \n \n14.1c Its preconditions  \n \nThere are preconditions for shortening:  \n \n1. The distance intended is in one go. If it is not intended, as when \nhe goes for a need which he thinks is close but ends up going a \nfurther distance. Indeed, that is the case if he is sure that it is but \nhe does not know exactly where. He does not shorten, even if he \ngoes four mail stages. Similarly he does not shorten when he stays \nin the middle of distance for the time in which it is obliged to do \nthe full prayer, like four days. To sum up, the first precondition \ncontains two things: one is the intention and the second is that it \nis in one go.  \n \nThe journey is a permissible one.  \n \nAccording to what is in ad-Dakhira, a traveler does not follow a \nresident. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said in the \nbook that he does it in full if he catches a rak'at with him. If he \ncatches less than a rak'at, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat he does not do the full prayer. The fiqh of the question is that \nif the follower is a traveler behind a resident sometimes he will \nintend the full prayer behind him and he will make his ihram like \nthat of the Imam. Sometimes he will intend the travel prayer. In \nall of this, he either catches one rak'at or not. In the first case, he \nfollows him absolutely. In the second if he catches a rak'at with \nhim, then his prayer is invalid. Otherwise it is valid and he prays \ntwo rak'ats.  \n \nHe does not turn a short journey into a long one without excuse. \n  \nHe does not shorten the prayers until he leaves the houses of the \ntown behind him.  \n \n14.1d When you can start shortening  \n \nYou are not permitted to shorten the prayer until you have \npassed beyond the houses of the town you are in so they \nare all behind you, leaving none in front of you or level \nwith you \n  \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is whether it is \na place where Jumu'a is held or not. That is the case in the well-\nknown \nposition. \nOpposite \nit \nis \nwhat \nShaikh \nMutarrif \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) related from the Imam that if the town from which the \njourney begins is a Jumu'a town, the prayer is not shortened until \nhe has gone three miles beyond its walls. Otherwise, it is from the \nend of its buildings. The place of the dispute is about adding the \ngardens when it happens that he passes the gardens. If the houses \nare separate, he must leave them all when they are united under \nthe name of 'quarter' and 'abode' or the name 'abode alone or the \nname 'quarter' when share together. Otherwise he shortens as \nsoon as he leaves his house. It is clear that they are behind him.  \n \n14.1e When you stop shortening  \n \nYou do not leave off shortening the prayers until you \nreturn to the place you set out from or come within a mile \nof it \n  \nUntil he returns to the houses or less than a mile. Shaikh ibn \n'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) is unsure of the words here. This \nphrase is unclear because at the beginning of his words he made it \nless than a mile while traveling and the last words he made him \nresident. This is not sound. Some say that the contradiction when \nhe says, \"until he returns to it.\" with \"or is near to it\" as another \nstatement means until he returns to it means until he is near \nthem. Then his words, \"or near\" mean the same. The upshot of \nthis interpretation is that if he is less than a mile, he must do the \nfull prayer, whether he is at its gardens or not. A little means a \nthird of a mile, or more.  \n \n14.1f If a traveler stays in a place for four days  \n \nIf a traveler intends to stay in a place for four days or \ntwenty prayers he should do the complete prayer until he \nmoves from that place \n  \n This is based on Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi). There are \ntwo positions. Shortening ends when he has the intention of \nstaying four full days or more if it reaches twenty prayers, and it \nis that on whose basis Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nproceeded. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) considers \nthat stopping the judgment of the journey is four full days and 20 \nprayers. So he considers that the stop which ends the judgment of \nthe journey is that he stays until the fourth 'Isha'. If someone \narrives before Fajr on a day and intends to leave after sunset on \nthe fourth, he shortens because he will not be there for the period \nof 20 prayers. Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh \nAbdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if the intention of \nwhat he will pray in it is 20 prayers, that ends the judgment of the \njourney. The point of the dispute appears when the time of Dhuhr \ncomes. If he is able to perform the prayers according to Dhuhr of \nits day and 'Asr and he does Dhuhr and 'Asr in full. If he counts \nthe days, he voids the day in which he entered, meaning he does \nnot count it among the four days which he abides. If someone \nintends to remain for four full days, he prays in full from the time \nhe enters the place in which he intends to remain. If he enters at \nDhuhr, he does it in full and completes 'Asr and 'Isha' and the day \nhe enters is not counted among the days which he abides.  \n \nThey make an exception to the intention of remaining four days or \nmore invalidating the principle of travel is the intention of an \narmy to stop in the Abode of War. What is meant by the Abode of \nWar is the place where the army settles, even in the Abode of \nIslam when it is not secure. Another things which stops \nshortening is the knowledge of abiding by custom like the custom \nof the hajji when he enters Makka to abide for four days.  \n \n14.2 Leaving and arriving towards the end of the time of \nDhuhr and 'Asr  \n \n14.2a Leaving before praying Dhuhr and 'Asr  \n \nIf you leave a place before you have prayed Dhuhr and 'Asr \nand there is still enough daytime left to pray three rak’ats \nyou should pray them both as traveling prayers. If there is \nonly enough time to pray two rak’ats or one you should \npray Dhuhr in full and 'Asr as a traveling prayer.  \n \nIf you start to travel in this case there is agreement if he omitted \nthem by forgetfulness. The same applies is that if he left them \nintentionally but he is a sinner. If he is like that, he prays them as \ntravel prayers because he travels in their time when Dhuhr is \nestimated as two rak'ats and one rak'at of 'Asr remains. There is \ndisagreement about this estimation and whether or not one takes \npurification into account in it he is not in a state of purity. Shaikh \nal-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. \nOthers said that it, and that is the position of Shaikh ibn 'Arafa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nIf there is only enough time for two rak'ats, you pray Dhuhr in full \nbecause you became responsible for it while resident. 'Asr is \nprayed with a traveling prayer, because he was traveling in its \ntime. He begins with Dhuhr according to Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim(rahmatullahi alaihi) , which is the preferred position. He \nbegins with 'Asr according to Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) so that he does not miss it in its time, while Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he begins with whichever he \nwishes because of the disagreement of the people of knowledge on \nthat. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn Shihab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) both say that he begins with the first while \nShaikh Sa‟id ibn al-Musayyab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he \nbegins with the last.  \n \n14.2b Arriving before having prayed them  \n \nIf you return from a journey without having prayed these \ntwo prayers and there is still time for five rak’ats you do \nthem both as full prayers  \n \nIf you return from a journey and there is time for five rak'ats in \nthe day, and you have forgotten to pray Dhuhr and 'Asr, you pray \nthem as resident because you have caught their time with four of \nDhuhr and one of 'Asr. The judgment of the deliberate is the same \nas the forgetful.  \n \n14.2c When there is still time for four rak'ats  \n \nbut if there is time for four rak’ats or less down to one \nrak’at you do Dhuhr as a traveling prayer and 'Asr in full \n  \nBecause the time for Dhuhr went when you were responsible for it \nwhile traveling. 'Asr is prayed in full because he caught it while \nresident.  \n \n14.3 Arriving at the end of the time of Maghrib and 'Isha'  \n \n14.3a When you arrive and there is time for one or more \nrak'ats  \n \nIf you return during the night without having prayed \nMaghrib and 'Isha and there is still time enough before \nFajr for one or more rak’ats you pray both Maghrib and \n'Isha in full \n  \nThis is estimated, and applies whether he omitted them out of \nforgetfulness or intentionally. They are prayed in full because \nthere remains enough time to catch Isha' and so he is obliged to \npray it as a resident. As for Maghrib, there is no disagreement \nthat it is always three, either at home or on a journey.  \n \n14.3b Setting out on a journey  \n \nIf you set out on a journey and there is enough of the night \nleft to pray one rak’at or more you do Maghrib in full and \npray 'Isha as a traveling prayer \n  \nBecause he catches its time in the journey. The rule of this \nchapter in relation to the two night prayers is that it considers one \nrak'at on arrival and leaving, while in relation to the day prayers \nor one of them, on leaving if there is what is enough for three \nrak'ats, he prays the two travel prayers and two or one. The \nsecond is a travel prayer. In respect of the day prayers, if he \narrives when there remains enough of the day to pray five rak'ats, \nthen he prays them as resident. If there are four or less to one, he \nprays Dhuhr as a travel prayer. Allah knows best.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Fifteen: On the Jumu'a (Friday) \nPrayer \n \n \nIt is obligatory. He clarifies the time of its obligation and the place \nin which it must be performed and for whom it is obligatory and \nother topics connected to it. It is derived from jama' (to gather) \nsince people gather in it and the first to call it Jumu'a was Qusayy \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu). He gathered Quraysh on that day and said, \n\"This is the Day of Jumu'a.\"  \n \n15.1 It is obligatory  \n \nGoing to Jumu'a is obligatory \n  \nIt is clear that what he goes to is obligatory. The Friday prayer \nand going to it are obligatory by the Book, sunnah and consensus. \nIn the Holy Qur'an, it is the words of the Almighty, \"O you who \nbelieve! When the prayer is called on the Day of Jumu'a, rush to \nthe remembrance of Allah.\" (Holy Qur‟an 62:9) Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"Going in the Book of Allah is action. Action and doing are \nsynonyms,\" i.e. it means that rushing to remembrance means \ngoing in general, whether it is on foot or not. Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) used as evidence for that the recitation, \"go \nto the remembrance of Allah.\" What is meant by remembrance is \nthe khutba or the prayer or both as stated by the commentator of \nthe Muwatta'.  \n \nAs for the sunnah, it is what is in Sahih Muslim from what the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said about some people who \nrefrained from going to Jumu'a: \"I seriously thought about \nordering a man to lead the people in prayer and then burning \ndown the houses of certain men who failed to attend Jumu'a.\"  \n \nAs for the consensus on that, Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) stated that there is no disagreement between the Imams \nthat Jumu'a is an individual obligation. Going to it is obliged \nwhen there is no impediment. If there is an impediment, then it is \nnot obligatory. The impediment can consist of various things: \nillness which makes it hard for him to do it, when one of his \nparents is ill or near death, or he fears loss. This also applies to \nclose relative, like child or wife. Another reason is when he fears \nfor his property from a ruler, thief or arsonists. Another reason is \nsevere rain and mud, etc.  \n \n15.1a When it becomes obligatory  \n \nIt becomes obligatory when the Imam sits on the minbar \nand the mu'adhdhins begins the adhan  \n \nThe obligation to go to the Jumu'a prayer begins when the \nmu'adhdhins begin the adhan if their house is near. As for \nsomeone whose house is far, it is according to what it takes to \nreach the place where Jumu'a is held at midday. These are the \ndetails for others than those by which the Jumu'a is held. As for \nthose who make up the number by which Jumu'a is held, they are \nobliged to go so that he will hears the khutba from its beginning. \nThose in the city and a distance of three miles or less from it are \nobliged to go to it.  \n \nThe two adhans were already mentioned. Jumu'a has two adhans: \none did not exist in the time of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam), and the other did. He explains the early one.  \n \n15.2 The Sunnah of the adhan  \n \nThe early sunnah was for the mu'adhdhins to climb the \nminaret  \n \nThe desirable method is to ascend when the Imam sits on the \nminbar. This was the sunnah of the Companions since there was \nno minaret in the time of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). They used to give the adhan at the door of the masjid. \nShaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. So there was one \nadhan in the time of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwhich was done at the door of the masjid while the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was sitting on the minbar. Then 'Uthman \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) introduced another adhan which was done \nbefore that on the minbar while the Imam was also sitting on the \nminbar. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"When the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) entered the masjid, he ascended \nthe minbar and sat. Then the mu‟adhdhins gave the adhan. There \nwere three who gave the adhan on the minaret one after the other. \nWhen the third finished, the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nstood up to give the khutba. It was like that in the time of Abu \nBakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu). Then \nwhen there were a lot of people, 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \ncommanded the introduction of an earlier adhan before that which \nwas done on the minaret and it was done at midday at az-Zawra', \na place in the market, so that people could gather and leave the \nmarket. When he went out and sat on the minbar, then the \nmu'adhdhin gave the adhan on the minbar. When Hisham ibn \n'Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) was khalif, he moved the \nadhan at az-Zawra' and put it on the minaret at midday. When he \nsat on the minbar, then an adhan was given in front of him. When \nthe mu'adhdhin finished, he gave the khutba. The adhan which \n'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) introduced is done first but was the \nsecond to be prescribed, and it happens now on the minaret. That \nwhich happens before the Khatib is done second but was first to be \nprescribed because that which is now done before the Khatib was \ndone at the door of the masjid in the time of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and Hisham (rahmatullahi alaihi) changed \nit.\" What is meant by the minaret in what Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said is the place where the adhan was given \nbecause there was no minaret in the time of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) and the place of the adhan was at the door \nof the masjid.  \n \n15.2b Consequences of the adhan for Jumu'a  \n \nat that point when selling or doing anything else which \nmight distract you from going to Jumu'a becomes haram \n  \nWhen the adhan is given before the imam, then selling becomes \nunlawful for everyone for whom Jumu'a is obligatory except the \none who is compelled to it as when it happens that the call for \nJumu'a is given and he cannot find water with which to purify \nhimself except by buying it. So both are allowed to buy and sell \nbecause this is part of mutual help to worship. Other distracting \nthings are forbidden: like eating, sewing, traveling, the gift, \nsadaqa and taking by a pre-preemption.  \n \n15.2c Giving an earlier adhan  \n \nThe calling of an earlier adhan is a practice which was \nintroduced by the Banu Umayya \n  \nIt was introduced by 'Uthman ibn „Affan (radhi‟Allahu anhu).  \n \n15.3 Preconditions for Jumu'a  \n \nKnow that Jumu'a has preconditions for its being obligatory, and \npreconditions for its performance. The difference between them is \nthat the preconditions for obligation are those by which \nresponsibility arises and the legally responsible person is not \nrequired to achieve them. The preconditions for performance are \nthose by which responsibility is removed and it is obligatory for \nthe responsible person to obtain them.   \n \n15.3a Preconditions for its being obligatory  \n \nThey are ten:  \n \nAnnouncement of the time  \n \nIslam  \n \nAdulthood  \n \nSanity  \n \nMaleness  \n \nBeing free  \n \nResidence  \n \nHealth  \n \nNearness so that he is not more than three miles away - or \nquarter or a third of a mile more.  \n \nThat it be a settled place.  \n \n15.3b Preconditions for performance  \n \nThey are four:  \n \nThe Imam \n  \nThe group  \n \nThe masjid  \n \nThe khutba.  \n \nThe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned some of these \nconditions and he did not distinguish them from one another.  \n \n15.3c The required size of the town  \n \nJumu'a is obligatory if there is a large enough town and a \nlarge enough group of people in it \n  \n It is clear from the school of Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that the Jumu'a is only held in the city. Some of his \ncompanions added that it should be in a city in which the Imam \nhas established the hudud. The school of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is held in the city and in the town \nwhere buildings are connected, even if their connection is only be \nbenefit in that they help one another, even the hudud are not \nestablished there. On this basis, the words of the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) must be interpreted that it is said that he \nmeant by town of connected buildings the category of towns.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it should be in the \noldest masjid of the locality.  \n \n15.3d The group  \n \nThe second is a precondition for validity, i.e. for establishing the \nJumu'a there must be a group. They do not give the number with \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), but what is meant is the \nexistence of those who are independent in terms of defense and \nmutual help in things necessary for life. When they can remain \nindefinitely with security and the power to defend themselves, \nthen the Jumu'a is valid, even if there are only twelve men \nremaining to complete the prayer with the Imam. There is no \ndifference between the first Jumu'a and others.  \n \n15.3e The khutba  \n \nThere must be a khutba before the prayer \n  \nIt is obligatory in the famous position, and it is said that it is \nsunnah. They are both related in the preferences. It is a \nprecondition of validity because it is not transmitted that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed Jumu'a without a khutba. \nIf they pray without a khutba, then they repeat it within the time. \nIf they do not repeat until the time has gone, they repeat it as \nDhuhr.  \n \n15.4 Preconditions for the khutba  \n \n15.4a Khutba before the prayer  \n \nThere are preconditions for the validity of the khutba. The author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) indicates them, beginning with the khutba \nbefore the prayer since the Almighty says, \"Then when the prayer \nis finished spread through the earth.\" (Holy Qur‟an 62:10) The fa' \nis for the order and consequence. It does not deny that people \ndisperse after the prayer and it is not incompatible with its being \nafter the khutba if the khutba is after the prayer. \"Afterness' is a \nwide preposition. That is what was done by him (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) and the Rightly-guided khalifs after him. Whoever is \nignorant and prays before the khutba repeats the prayer only. One \nprecondition is that it is after midday. One of them is that it is in \nthe presence of the group by whom the Jumu'a is constituted. One \nof them is that it is two khutbahs. If there is one khutba and then \nhe prays, the Jumu'a is repeated after the second khutba. The \nseparation between the two khutbahs by the prayer is slight, and \nso it does not oblige the invalidation of the first khutba.  \n \nThe least of what satisfies the khutba in the well-known position \nis that to which khutba is applied to by the Arabs. It is a form of \nrhymed words different from poetry or prose. For it to be done not \nin Arabic is null. If no one can be found who knows Arabic, then it \nis canceled. It is said that its minimum is \"Alhamdulillah\" and the \n“prayer on the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) \" and cautioning \nand good news. This is weak since the accepted position is that \nthey are recommended in the two khutbahs. Another precondition \nit is that it is out loud. If it is silent it is null. There are two well-\nknown positions about whether purification is a precondition for \nits validity. One of them if that purification is not a precondition \nand it is disliked without it.  \n \n15.4b Leaning on a bow or staff and sitting in the middle  \n \nDuring the khutba the Imam should lean on a bow shaft or \na staff. He should sit before the start of the khutba and in \nthe middle of it \n  \nWhile he is giving his khutba, it is recommended that he lean on a \nbow shaft or staff. He sits at the beginning of the khutba and in \nthe middle. There is disagreement about this and in standing for \nit. Shaikh al-Maziri (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that standing for it \nis obligatory and a precondition, It is said that it is a sunnah. If he \ngives the khutba sitting it is valid, but he behaves badly. So both \nof the first and second sitting are sunnah in the well-known \nposition. The length of the middle sitting is that of the sitting \nbetween the two prostration‟s. The basis in what he mentioned is \nthat it continues to be the action in all cities and times from the \ntime of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) until now.  \n \n15.4c After the khutba  \n \nThe prayer is performed when the khutba is over \n  \nIt is a precondition to connect the prayer to the khutba, and a \nshort gap is overlooked as opposed to a large one. It is obliged as a \nprecondition that the Imam of the prayer is the Khatib. If \nsomething prevents his Imamate, like breaking wudu', or a \nnosebleed, and water is near, the prayer must wait for him. If it is \nfar, he delegates someone, and it is desirable that he delegates \nsomeone who was at the khutba.   \n \n15.5The Rak'ats of Jumu'a  \n \n15.5a Two rak'ats done out loud  \n \nThe prayer consists of two rak’ats in which the Imam \nrecites out loud \n  \nThere is agreement that the prayer is two rak'ats. If it is \ndeliberately more, it is invalid. If he adds out of oversight, then he \nproceeds on the basis of having added something to the prayer. \nThe Imam must intend to be the Imam. Otherwise the intention is \nnot adequate. It is recommended to perform the prayer at the \nbeginning of the time. Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat there is no one disagrees that the beginning of its time is \nmidday. The well-known position is that it extends until sunset.  \n \n15.5b Recitation in it  \n \nIn the first rak’at he should recite Surat al-Jumu'a (Holy \nQur’an 62) or something similar and in the second Surat al-\nGhashiya (Holy Qur’an 88) or something similar \n  \nThere is consensus that recitation in it is out loud. In the first \nrak'at after the Fatiha he recites Surat al-Jumu'a (Holy Qur‟an \n62). Shaikh ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) objects to \"or \nsomething similar\" since it is recommended to recite Surat al-\nJumu'a (Holy Qur‟an 62) in it since it contains the rules of Jumu'a \nand because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to \nrecite it at the first rak'at. The answer to that objection is that he \nmeans to refute the one who said that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) only recited it in Jumu'a. In Sahih Muslim we \nread that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) recited al-A'la \n(Holy Qur‟an 87) in the first rak'at., There is no objection to the \nfact that in the second rak'at it is recommended that he recite \nSurat al-Ghashiya (Holy Qur‟an 88) or its like.  \n \n15.6 The obligation of Jumu'a  \n \n15.6a Its obligatory nature  \n \nGoing to Jumu'a is obligatory for anyone in the town or \nwithin three miles of it \n  \nIt is agreed that it is obligatory if he meets the preconditions of \nthe Jumu'a and has no legitimate impediment, as it is obligatory \nfor those outside the city within three miles. That is the position of \nShaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn \nal-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated it. Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others say that the distance begins from \nthe masjid. That is the position of the author of al-'Umda. He \ndeduced that because the definition of three miles is by hearing, \nand hearing related to the minaret. If it is said that it is not \nobliged if it is more, that is the position of Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). What is relied on is the transmission of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), that three miles is \napproximate and so it is obliged for those a little beyond it, like a \nthird or quarter of a mile. Then he indicates the preconditions of \nJumu'a:  \n \n15.6b Those for whom it is not obligatory  \n \nIt is not obligatory for travelers nor is it obligatory for the \npeople at Mina nor for slaves, women or children \n  \nIt is agreed that it is not obligatory for the traveler, nor for the \npeople of Mina other than its inhabitants. It is obligatory for its \ninhabitants when they have a sufficient number for Jumu'a, \nwhether they are Hajjis or not. Nor is it obligatory for women or \nchildren by agreement. The basis in what was mentioned is what \nShaikh at-Tabarani (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in al-Kabir from \nthe words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"Jumu'a is \nobligatory for every Muslim except four - a owned slave, a woman, \na child, and someone who is ill.\" If those for whom it is not \nobligatory he attends it and prays, it suffices for Dhuhr.  \n \n15.6c When a slave or woman is present  \n \nIf a slave or a woman does attend they should do the \nJumu'a prayer \n  \nMeaning it is sufficient for Dhuhr. In the case of the traveler, it is \nsufficient for Dhuhr according to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it \nis not sufficient for him because he is not responsible for it. The \nnafila does not satisfy the fard.   \n \n15.6d Where women stand  \n \nWomen should be behind the rows of the men. Young \nwomen should not go to Jumu'a \n  \n15.6e The obligation to listen to the Imam  \n \nIt is obligatory to listen to the Imam while he is giving the \nkhutba \n  \nIt is obligatory for everyone who attends the Jumu'a to be silent \nand listen to the Imam while he is giving the first and second \nkhutbahs and in the sitting between them, whether he can hear \nthe khutba or whether the Imam abuses someone he is not \npermitted to abuse or praises someone he is not permitted to \npraise. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that words \nare permitted if the Imam says something which is not permitted. \nShaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that is correct. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar confines himself to \nit. One does bless the sneezer and he says “Praise be to Allah\" \nsilently in himself. One does not greet nor return a greeting, even \nby indication. One does not drink water. In short, he is forbidden \nanything incompatible with the obligation of being silent, even for \nthe one who is not listening. The basis for that is the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) in the two Sahih collections: \n\"Even saying, 'Be quiet!' to your companion while the Imam is \nspeaking on the Day of Jumu'a constitutes foolish chatter.\" If \ncommanding to the correct is called foolish talk, so that applies \neven more to other things. 'Foolish talk' is speech in which there is \nno good.  \n \nAmong the times when speech is permitted is the time when he \nasks for blessing for the Companions and supplication for the \nruler. It is permitted to speak during the khutba for certain \nmatters which include a little dhikr when there reason for it, \nsaying 'Amin' with listening to forgiveness or rescue from the Fire, \nseeking refuge when hearing the Fire and Shaitan mentioned, and \nthe prayer on the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) when he  is \nmentioned. All that is silent and disliked out loud.  \n \n15.6f Sitting facing the Imam  \n \nand you should sit facing him  \n \nThe people face the Imam while he is giving the khutba, and all \nrows are the same in this. What Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says about the first row not having to do that is weak.  \n \n15.7 Other points related to Jumu'a  \n \n15.7a Ghusl  \n \nIt is also necessary to do a ghusl before going to Jumu'a \n  \nGhusl for the Jumu'a prayer is obligatory, not for the day. It is \npart of the adab of the prayer. It is obligatory as a confirmed \nsunnah. Its time is before the Jumu'a prayer. It must be connected \nto going out to the Jumu'a in the well-known position. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if he washes after Fajr, that \nis enough, even if it is not connected to going out. It is performed \nthe same as the ghusl on account on janaba.  \n \n15.7b Going early to the masjid  \n \nIt is recommended to get to the masjid early but not right \nat the beginning of the day \n  \nOne of the adab of Jumu'a is to go early. It is recommended \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and the \nCompanions used to do that, i.e. they went to the masjid at this \ntime. The first of what satisfies it is the sixth meant where the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) says, \"Whoever washes on \nthe Day of Jumu'a and then goes in the first hour, it is as if he \noffered a camel.\" It is not at the beginning of the day for that is \ndisliked because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did not \ndo it and none of the Companions did it.  \n \n15.7c Perfume and best clothes  \n \nIt is also good to put on perfume and dress in your best \nclothes \n  \nIt is recommended that perfume be put on for it. One of the adab \nof the Jumu'a is to use perfume for the one who attends it - men \nbut not women. It is perfume whose color is hidden and scent is \ndiscerned, like musk. By it he intends to obey the sunnah and does \nnot intend boasting and showing off.  \n \nOne of the adab is to deck oneself in one's best lawful clothes. It is \nthat which the people of the Shari‟ah consider good on this day, \nFriday: it is white. The basis is in what Abu Dawud (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) related from the hadith of Abu Hurayra (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nwhere the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"\"If anyone \nbathes on Jumu'a, puts on his best clothes, applies on scent in his \nhouse if he has any, then comes to Jumu'a, and takes care not to \nstep over the necks of people, then prays what was prescribed for \nhim and then keeps silent when the Imam comes out until he \nfinishes his prayer, it will expiate for what happened in the \nprevious week.\" Abu Hurayra (radhi‟Allahu anhu) says \"And three \ndays more.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) says, \"The good actions is \nmultiplied ten times.\"  \n \n15.7d Leaving without doing nafila  \n \nWith us it is preferred that you should leave after finishing \nthe prayer without doing any nafila rak’ats in the masjid \n  \nThe Malikis prefer that one who prays Jumu'a leave after \nfinishing the tasbih and the like connected to it and not do any \nnafila in the masjid, whether Imam or follower. It is like that by \nagreement about the Imam. According to one statement about the \nfollower, i.e. it is part of the adab that the one who prays Jumu'a \nleave after the prayer and not do any nafila is based it being is \nrelated that Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) prayed \nJumu'a and left and prayed two rak'ats in his house. Then he said, \n'The Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) used to do this with nafila \nafter them.\" As for before, it is permitted for the follower rather \nthan the Imam, i.e. desirable.  \n \n15.7e Nafila before Jumu'a  \n \nYou can do nafila rak’ats before Jumu'a \n  \nThe one who is a follower in the masjid can do nafila before \nJumu'a if he wishes as long as the Imam has not sat on the \nminbar. If he sits, then there is no nafila. When he comes out for \nthe khutba, he does not do nafila. When he enters while he is \ndoing nafila, he makes it quick.  \n \n15.7f The Imam does not do nafila  \n \nThe Imam should not do any nafila rak’ats before the \nprayer but should go straight to the minbar when he comes \nin \n  \nThe Imam does not do nafila before Jumu'a in the masjid, i.e. it is \ndisliked for the Imam since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did not pray before Jumu'a at all. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that that is the same whether there is \nample time or not.  \n \nThe recommended adab include trimming the mustache and nails, \nplucking the armpits, shaving the pubes when that is needed, \nusing the tooth-stick and walking to the prayer based on what is \nreported about that in traditions.  \n \n \n \nChapter Sixteen: On the Fear Prayer \n \n \n16.1 Its Judgment  \n \nShaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is possible to \ndefine it as doing one of the five fard prayers. Its judgment is \nobligatory, i.e. obligatory as a sunnah. Shaikh ibn al-Mawwaz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is an allowance and the author \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) of the Mukhtasar confines himself to the \ntruth of the allowance for it, a which is the legal principle of the \nexcuse which allows what is forbidden, like eating carrion. It is \nprescribed by an excuse, which is necessity while confirming the \nexistence of the forbidden, which is foulness in carrion. By analogy \nhe says here that it is prescribed for an excuse, which is fear, with \nthe establishment of the forbidden, which is altering the \nprescribed prayer.  \n \nThere is no contradiction between its being sunnah and its being \nan allowance because the allowance can become an obligation: like \neating carrion for one so compelled. The evidence for the \nconfirmation of its judgment and that it is not abrogated is the \nBook, the sunnah and consensus. Shaikh al-Muzani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) claims that it is abrogated, but that is rejected. As for its \nevidence in the Book, it is the words of the Almighty, \"When you \nare with them\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:102) In the sunnah, part of it is \nwhat Yazid ibn Ruman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) related with his isnad \nthat a group prayed with the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  \nwhile a group faced the enemy. He (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed \none rak'at with them and then remained standing and they led \nthemselves. Then they went and faced the enemy and the other \ngroup came and he led them in the remaining rak'at and then \nremained sitting and they led themselves. Then he said the salam \nwith them. As for consensus, a group of the Companions prayed it \nafter the death of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nincluding 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (radhi‟Allahu anhu), Abu Hurayra \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu), and Abu Musa (radhi‟Allahu anhu), and none \nof the Companions objected to it. It was done on journeys and \nwhile resident, singly and in groups.  \n \n16.2 When it is done on a journey  \n \nThe fear prayer is done when traveling if there is fear of \ntrouble from an enemy \n  \nThe fear prayer is done when the Muslims fear the enemy, i.e. \nthey believe or think that there is harm from the enemy. What is \nmeant are the unbelievers because fighting them allowed, and \nthere is an analogy made to include revels.  \n \n16.2a Beginning the Fear Prayer  \n \nThe Imam steps forward with one group leaving the other \ngroup to face the enemy \n  \nAs in al-Mukhtasar, whether the enemy is in qibla or not. It is like \nthat as opposed to Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) who said \nthat if the enemy is in the direction of the qibla, they all pray with \nthe Imam without any division since they see the enemy. It is not \na precondition that the two groups be equally divided as opposed \nto the one who makes that a precondition. The sound version is \nthat each group should have power to resist the enemy. If the \nenemy can be resisted by half, they are divided in two halves. If \nthey can be resisted with a third, he prays with a third the first \nrak'at, and with two-thirds in the second. According to the Imam \nhe informs people how it will be done they begin the prayer to \navoid confusions since most people are not familiar with it.  \n \n16.2bThe first group  \n \nHe prays one rak’at with this group and then remains \nstanding while they pray a second rak’at by themselves. \nThey then say the salam and go and stand where their \ncompanions were standing \n  \nHe leads the group in prayer and remains on his own and then \nthey leave him. If that happens deliberately before he is on his \nown, then their prayer is invalid. When he is on his own, he can \nchose between standing between recitation, supplication or \nsilence. Then they pray a rak'at on their own, say the salam and \ngo to replace the second group in facing the enemy.  \n \n16.2c The second group  \n \nThis second group then come and do the takbir al-ihram. \nThe Imam prays his second rak’at with them and then does \nthe tashahhud and says the salam whereupon they pray \ntheir second rak’at and finish their prayer \n  \nThen the second group say the ihram and stand behind the Imam \nwho prays the second rak'at. The Imam says the tashahhud and \nsalam in the well-known position. A counter view it is that he does \nnot say the salam, but indicates to the second group to stand for \nthe second rak'at which they owe and pray it, and he says the \nsalam for it. So they catch the salam with him as the first group \ncaught the ihram. The well-known position is that the Imam says \nthe salam and does not wait for the second group who pray with \nhim one rak'at and left the Imam. They make up the rak'at they \nmissed with him and finish.  \n \n16.2d The case of Maghrib  \n \nThis is what is done for all the fard prayers except \nMaghrib when the Imam prays two rak’ats with the first \ngroup and one with the second \n  \nIn Maghrib, the Imam prays two rak'ats and says the tashahhud. \nAfter he has said the tashahhud, he stands and remains so \naccording to the well-known position and indicates to the first \ngroup to stand. Then they stand and complete their prayer on \ntheir own. They say the tashahhud and the salam and leave and \ntake the place of their companions. Then the second group come \nand say the ihram behind him and he leads them in praying a \nrak'at and then says the tashahhud and salam. Then they finish \nthe two rak'ats they missed with the Fatiha and sura and then \nthey go. This description which the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentions is the well-known one from the position of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and he considers it sound that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it.  \n \nIt was two preconditions: the first is that the fighting is permitted, \ni.e. allowed, and it includes the obligatory, like fighting the people \nof shirk and rebellion, and the permitted, like fighting those who \ndesire property and that those who pray with Imam can leave. If \nthe enemy is such that they cannot resist the ambush, then the \nsecond is not permitted when the fear ends in the course of the \nprayer. They complete it with the quality of security. If there is \nsecurity after the prayer, it is not repeated. This is the description \nof the fear prayer when traveling.  \n \n16.3 When it is done while Resident  \n \n16.3aWhen there is danger  \n \nIf an Imam is leading the prayer in a situation of great \ndanger for a group of people who are not traveling, he \nprays two rak’ats with each group for Dhuhr, 'Asr, and \n'Isha \n  \nWhen they are resident, the Imam can lead them in the fear \nprayer. The expression of Shaikh al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi) is \nclearer than this: \"When there is fear in the resident prayer, it is \nnot permitted to shorten the prayer, but it is permitted to divide \nthe people. So the Imam leads one of the two groups in two rak'ats \nand sits and does the tashahhud and then indicates them to stand \nto complete it. It is said that he stands when he finishes his \ntashahhud and waits for them to finish and go and the others to \ncome, standing, silent or making supplication, not reciting. Then \nhe prays the remaining two rak'ats with the second group. Then \nhe says the salam and they finishes what they misses after the \nsalam, It is said that he waits for them to make up what they \nmissed and then says the salam, and they say the salam with his \nsalam, but the first is the well-known.  \n \n16.3b The adhan and iqama  \n \nThe adhan and the iqama are done for each prayer \n  \nTraveling and when resident in a group. This is because every \nprayer is an obligation absolutely in the journey, and when \nresident.   \n \n16.4 The Fear Prayer done alone  \n \nIf the situation is too dangerous for even this, then \neveryone should pray individually as best they can, either \non foot or horseback, walking or running, and whether \nfacing the qibla or not \n  \nIf it is too dangerous for a group prayer, then they pray \nindividually as best they can in ruku' and prostration. If they \ncannot do that, they use gestures to indicate prostration lower \nthan bowing. They can be on foot or mounted on horses or camels, \nwalking or running, facing qibla or not. Then they do not have to \nrepeat it when they are safe, wither in the time or after it. The \nbasis for what he mentioned is the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"If \nyou fear an enemy, then pray on foot or riding,\" (Holy Qur‟an \n2:239) and His words, \"Remember Allah standing and sitting and \nlying on your sides. When you are safe again do the prayer in the \nnormal way.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:103) So Allah Almighty commands \nthat you pray the prayer in its time according to the situation. In \nthe Muwatta', Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"When fear is intense, then pray, standing, and on foot or riding, \nfacing qibla or not.\" Nafi' (radhi‟Allahu anhu) ) said, \"I do not \nthink 'Abdullah (radhi‟Allahu anhu) mentioned that except from \nthe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam).\"  \n \nNOTE: It is permitted in a state of intense fear to walk a lot and \nto rush, which is to move the foot, jab with the spear, and shoot \nthe arrow and speech, even if it is a lot if he needs to do that in \nwhat is connected to them, like warning someone about someone \nwho is aiming at him, telling him to kill him, glorification and \nboasting when shooting, or rajaz poetry if he prepares that to \nweaken the enemy. Otherwise there is no need for it.  \n \n \n \nChapter Seventeen: On the two ‘Id prayers and \nthe takbirs on the days of Mina \n \n \nThis is Fitr and Adha. He clarifies the time for going out to them \nand how they are done, and clarifies the path by which one \nreturns from them and what he does and what he says when he \ngoes out to them. He also explains the takbirs in the days of Mina \nand the time in which the takbir occurs on the days of Mina and \nclarifies what it is recommended to do on the day of the „Id. He \nbegins with their judgment. \n  \n17.1 Its judgment  \n \nPraying the two ‘Id prayers is an obligatory sunnah \n  \nWhat is meant is that both of them are confirmed sunnah‟s. So it \nis a confirmed sunnah and is an individual sunnah in respect of \nthe one obliges to go to Jumu'a: a legally responsible free man, etc. \nIt is not sunnah for a slave, child, madman, women or traveler. \nThe traveler is the one who is more than three miles outside the \nland of Jumu'a, but it is recommended for the one who is not \ncommanded to it to pray it. So it is desirable for the slave, woman, \nchild and the one a residing outside the land of Jumu'a although \nthere is an exception for the hajji traveler at Mina. They are not \ncommanded to establish it nor is it desirable or sunnah because \nthe standing at the Mash'ar takes the place of his praying Jumu'a. \nAs for the people of Mina, their praying for it in a group is a \nblameworthy innovation. There is no harm in a man praying it for \nhimself. It is recommended for someone who misses the „Id prayer \nwith the Imam to pray it alone. If a woman goes to it, she does not \nwear clothes meant to attract people's attention nor does she put \non perfume out of fear of sedition, i.e. doing that is unlawful is the \nfear is probable, and it is disliked if it is uncertain. The old woman \nand others are equal in this.   \n \n17.2 How to do the prayer  \n \n17.2a The time of setting out  \n \nThe Imam and the people should leave for the prayer early \nin the morning so that by the time they arrive at the \nprayer place the time for the prayer has come \n  \nThe time for setting out for the „Id prayer for the Imam and people \nis after sunrise so when they reach the place of prayer, it is time \nfor the prayer. This is for the one whose house is near. As for the \none whose house is far, he leaves before that so that he can catch \nthe prayer with the Imam. This is the clarification of the time of \nsetting out, not the time of the prayer which he mentions: when he \narrives, it is the time of the prayer.  \n \nIts time is when the sun is the height of one or two Arab spears, \nwhich is 12 spans, by the medium span. This is relation to what \nthe eye sees. In actual terms, it is when the sun traverses the \ndistance which only Allah azza wa jall knows. It is recommended \nto go out for it to the place of prayer. Makka and other places are \nthe same in that. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \npeople of Makka prayed in the Masjid al-Haram, i.e. in sight of the \nKa'ba. It is an act of worship lacking elsewhere. It is reported that \nevery day 120 mercies descend on this House, 60 for those doing \ntawaf, 40 for those praying, and 20 for those looking at it.  \n \nIt is recommended to walk when going to the „Id prayers rather \nthan returning because he has finished an act of nearness. It is \nrecommended to eat before going to the prayer on the „Id al-Fitr \nbut not the „Id al-Adha.  \n \n17.2b No adhan or iqama  \n \nThere is no adhan or iqama for the ‘Id prayers \n  \nIn the well-known position there is no call for the prayer to gather \nbased on what is found in Sahih Muslim from 'Ata' (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu). Jabir (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  reported that there is no adhan \non the Day of Fitr before the Imam goes out nor after he goes out \nand there is no iqama or call in the masjid of the prayer and \nnothing is done to announce the prayer, like beating a drum, for \ninstance. When there time comes, there is no adhan or iqama or \ncall. The Imam simply begins the prayer. \n \n17.2c Two rak'ats recited out loud  \n \nThe Imam leads the prayer in two rak’ats, reciting out loud \nin each of them \n  \nHe leads the people by reaching the place of prayer or the masjid \nafter the nafila when the people are gathered. He prays two \nrak'ats based on what is in the two Sahih collections that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed it as two rak'ats. It was \nlike that with the khalifs after them. There is no disagreement \nthat he recites out loud.  \n \n17.2d What is recited  \n \nIn both he recites the Fatiha and a sura such as Surat al-\nA'la (Holy Qur’an 87) or Surat ash-Shams (Holy Qur’an 91) \n  \nAccording to what is in the Muwatta and Sahih Muslim the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) used to recite Qaf (Holy Qur‟an \n87) and al-Qamar (Holy Qur‟an 54) in Adha and Fitr.   \n \n17.2e The takbirs  \n \nIn the first rak’at he says seven takbirs including the \ntakbir al-ihram. In the second he says five takbirs not \nincluding the takbir for standing up from sajda \n  \nHe does not raise his hands in any takbir, either in the first or \nsecond except the takbir al-Ihram in the well-known position. It is \nreported from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he \nrecommended it in every takbir. The takbirs are connected to each \nother except for the amount of the takbir of those following. It is \ndesirable for him to separate them by that amount. If the Imam \nsays the takbir more than seven in the first or more than five in \nthe second, the follower does not follow him, even if that is the \nschool of the Imam. He says the takbir before recitation, even if \nthe school of the Imam is to delay, as the literal evidence of the \npeople of the School indicates. If the Imam forgets a takbir of the \n„Id prayer, he goes back as long as he has not moved into ruku'. \nWhen he places his hands on his knees, he does not go back. If he \ngoes back, some of them deduce that it is not invalid and others \ndeduce that it is invalid. The reason for that is he returns from a \nfard to a Sunnah.  \n \nIf he places his hands on his knees having missed a takbir \ninadvertently, he continues and prostrates before the salam. \nAnyone who comes after the Imam has finished the takbirs and \nfinds him reciting, says that the takbir in the well-known position \nas opposed to Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi). He said it is \nbecause he becomes someone who is making up in the judgment of \nthe Imam. The opinion of the one with the well-known position is \nthat he is not making up by the insignificance of the matter.  \n \nIt is like that when he catches of the takbirs. He says the takbir \nwith him for what he caught of it and then completes what \nremains of the Imam beginning the recitation. He does not say \nthat takbir for what he has missed in the takbirs of the Imam. If \nhe finds him in the ruku', he says the takbir al-ihram and owes \nnothing. If he catches the recitation in the second rak'at, he says \nfive takbirs since the takbir of standing is canceled for him. When \nhe makes up the first, he says the takbir seven times counting the \ntakbir of standing in them since he missed the takbir al-ihram.  \n \n17.2f Tashahhud  \n \nThere are two sajdas in each rak’at and the prayer is \ncompleted with the tashahhud followed the salam \n  \nAfter the two prostration‟s comes the tashahhud, i.e. the prayer on \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and supplication. He \nincludes all of it. There is the salam after the tashahhud.  \n \n17.2g The khutba  \n \nThe Imam then gets up onto the minbar and gives a \nkhutba. He sits before it begins and again in the middle \n  \nAfter finishing the salam, the Imam goes up the minbar. So the \nkhutba is after the prayer. The khutba of the „Id is not like that of \nJumu'a in respect to time. This is after the prayer and the other is \nbefore the prayer. Nor in respect of beginning. This begins with \ntakbir and that with praise and the prayer on the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). It is like it inasmuch as they are both in \nArabic and out loud: that is necessary in both. The text of the \nMukhtasar states that it is recommended that the khutba be after \nthe prayer based on what is in the Sahih that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) used to begin with the prayer before the \nkhutba and this was the action of the Rightly-guided khalifs after \nhim. He sits at the beginning and middle of it because they are \ntwo khutbahs within the whole khutba according to the judgments \nof the „Id and what is prescribed it in is obligatory and \nrecommended.  \n \n17.2h After the khutba  \n \nWhen it is finished he leaves \n  \nThe Imam then leaves without sitting down after he finishes the \nkhutba if he wishes. He can stay where he is. It is disliked for him \nand those following him to do nafila before it and after it if it is \ndone in the desert based on what is in the two Sahih collections \nthat the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) went out on the Day of \nal-Adha and prayed two rak'ats without not praying before or \nafter them. If it is performed in a masjid, it is not disliked either \nfor him or those following to do nafila before or after it according \nto Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) because the hadith \nhas described the desert.  \n \n17.2i How to return home  \n \nIt is recommended for him to return by a different route \nfrom the one he came by and this applies to everyone else \nas well \n  \nThe Imam should return by a different route since it is affirmed \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to do that. This \nis true for people because they are the same in this. As the Imam \nshould return by a different route, so those who follow do so since \nthe wisdom applies to all.  \n \n17.3 On ‘Id al-Adha  \n \nIf it is the ‘Id al-Adha (sacrifice) the Imam should bring his \nsacrificial animal to the prayer-place and slaughter it \nthere so that everyone else can slaughter their animals \nafter him \n  \nWhen the Imam goes to the „Id prayer on the Day of Sacrifice, he \nshould bring his animal to the prayer-place and slaughter it so \nthat people will know and they can go and slaughter after him \nsince they are not be permitted to slaughter before him. If \nsomeone slaughters before him, it is agreed that he must repeat it. \nIf the Imam does not bring his animal to the prayer-place, they \nslaughter after he returns to his home and that it enough for \nthem, even if they err and actually slaughter before him.  \n \n17.4 Dhikr on the Way to the Prayer  \n \nOn both the ‘Id al-Fitr and the ‘Id al-Adha the Imam should \ndo dhikr Allah out loud from the time he leaves his house \nuntil he arrives at the prayer-place. Everyone else does the \nsame continuing until the arrival of the Imam when they \nstop \n  \nIt is recommended for the Imam or others to say the takbir when \nthey leave the house. It is understood from his words that he does \nnot say the takbir before he leaves. It is the well-known position. \nThere is the position that the beginning of the time of takbir \nbegins from sunset on the night of the „Id. That is for the „Id al-\nFitr and „Id al-Adha. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat he does not say the takbir for the „Id al-Fitr. His evidence is \nwhat ad-Daraqutni (radhi‟Allahu anhu) related that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to say the takbir of the Day \nof Fitr when he (alaihi salat wa salam) left his house until he \ncomes to prayer place. That was the action of the people of Madina \nas opposed to the Salaf. It is clear that the words of the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he says the takbir whether he leaves \nbefore or after sunrise. It is stated by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) in al-Mabsut. Some of them transmit that that which \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says in al-Mabsut is that the \ntakbir is from the time of leaving the Subh prayer. Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi), who has most appropriate \nposition, said that that especially applies to Adha to achieve \nresemblance with the people of the Mash'ar. This takbir is out \nloud according to most scholars so that he hears himself as do \nthose near him and a little beyond that. Shaikh al-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) went out on the Day of Fitr and Adha, raising his voice in \nthe takbir and that continued to be the action of the Salaf. When \nhe reaches the prayer-place, that is the end of the takbir of the \nImam.  \n \nWhat is meant by the people doing it is that they do the same as \nthe Imam in beginning the takbir and its description. In the end, \nthey differ from him because they stop the takbir when he reaches \nits place.  \n \n17.4a When the Imam says that takbir in the khutba  \n \nEvery time the Imam says the takbir during his khutba \neveryone else should repeat it to themselves. Otherwise \nthey should remain silent and pay attention \n  \nSilently. According to the School, a group of the Companions did \nthat. They are silent for other than the takbir according to Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi), in the transmission of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), because they must listen and it \nresembles Jumu'a.  \n \n17.5 Saying \"Allahu Akbar\" on the Days of Mina  \n \n17.5a Takbirs after the prayers  \n \nDuring the 'days of sacrifice' you should do the takbir \nstraight after each fard prayer starting with Dhuhr on the \nday on the ‘Id and ending with Subh on the fourth day, this \nbeing the last of the days of Mina \n  \nIt is recommended for the people to say the takbirs after the fard \nprayers before the tasbih, praise and takbirs. It is evident from his \nwords that the Imam, the followers, and the one on his own, male \nand female, are all equal in that. He mentions the fard rather \nthan the nafila, and the present rather than the missed prayer. \nThe takbirs begin at Dhuhr and end with Subh on the fourth day \nafter the sacrifice  \n \n17.5b Form of takbir  \n \nThe form of this takbir which is done after the prayers is: \n'Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.'  \n \nIf you do tahlil and tahmid as well that is good. If you want \nto do that you say,  \n \n'Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar la ilaha ill’Allah wa’Allahu \nAkbar Allahu Akbar wa lillahi'l-hamd.'  \n \nThis has been related from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Both the first formula and the fuller version are \nequally acceptable.  \n \nThere are two descriptions of it. One is: 'Allahu Akbar, Allahu \nAkbar, Allahu Akbar,' and the second is recommended and given. \nIf you wish, you can combine them. This is related from Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) via Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrecommended it. The first is also related from 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) and Qadi „Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated that it is well-\nknown. Both are permitted because it is not established that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) specified either of these two. \nWhen the command to do dhikr when leaving for the „Id prayer \nwas mentioned, what is meant by is the dhikr commanded in the \nwords of the Almighty: \"Mention Allah's name on particular days,\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 22:28) and His words, \"Remember Allah on the \ndesignated days\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:203) is appropriate to mention on \nthese days.  \n \n17.5c \"Particular days\"  \n \nThe 'particular days' [These are mentioned in the Holy \nQur'an.] are the three days of sacrifice. The designated \ndays' are the days of Mina, namely the three days after the \n‘Id \n  \nThe designated are for the stoning mentioned in the ayat. They \nare the second and third days of the Day of Sacrifice. The first of \nthe day of sacrifice is particular and not designated. The fourth is \ndesignated and not particular. The two middle days are both \nparticular and designated.  \n \n17.6 Preparing for the prayer  \n \n17.6a A ghusl  \n \nIt is good to do ghusl for both the ‘Ids but it is not \nnecessary \n  \nIt is recommended to have a ghusl, in the same form as the ghusl \nfor janaba. It is asked of every one with discrimination, even if not \nlegally responsible nor intending to go to the prayer. It is not \nnecessary as sunnah. The best time is after the Subh prayer. It is \nenough if he washes before Fajr.  \n \n17.6b Perfume and best clothes  \n \nand it is recommended to use perfume and to wear your \nbest clothes \n  \nPerfume is recommended for men whether or not they go to the \nprayer. If women go to the prayer, it is not permitted for them to \nuse perfume, and there is no difference between old woman and \nothers. There is no harm if they do not go out. It is recommended \nfor men to wear their best clothes, which means new, even if they \nare black. All the evidence for that is in the sunnah. In the hadith \nof Ibn 'Abbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \"The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) used to bathe on the Day of Fitr and Adha and put on \nperfume and encouraged that, and he ordered us when we went to \nthe place of prayer to wear the best clothes we had.\"  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Eighteen: On the eclipse prayer \n \n \nClarification of its general description in the solar and lunar \neclipses. The terms kusuf and khusuf are synonyms and both used \nfor the sun and moon. It is said that there is a difference between \nthem: kusuf is when the light changes and khusuf is when the \nlight goes entirely. The moon loses all its light, but the sun is not \nlike that, and so khusuf is used of the moon and kusuf of the sun. \nTheir evidence is in the sunnah where the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"The sun and moon are not eclipsed for the \ndeath or life of anyone. When you see that, remember Allah azza \nwa jall.\" One variant has, \"then pray.\" The eclipse prayer is \nSunnah.  \n \n18.1The Solar Eclipse  \n \n18.1a Its judgment  \n \nThe eclipse prayer is an obligatory sunnah whenever there \nis an eclipse of the sun \n  \nIt is agreed that the Solar Eclipse prayer is a confirmed Sunnah. \nThere is disagreement about the lunar eclipse. The two famous \npositions are that the lunar eclipse prayer is recommended as \nShaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated. The solar eclipse \nprayer is done in a group or singly. It is better in a group.  \n \n18.1b How it is done: first recitation  \n \nThe Imam goes to the masjid and begins to lead the people \nin prayer without either an adhan or an iqama. He recites \nsilently a very long piece of the Holy Qur'an such as Surat \nal-Baqara. Then he goes into ruku' for the same amount of \ntime. Then he stands upright again saying Sami ’Allahu \nliman hamidah'  \n \nWhen the sun is eclipsed, wholly or partly, the Imam goes to the \nmasjid, and when he arrives, he leads the people in prayer. There \nis no precondition of number in it, like Jumu'a. There is no adhan \nor iqama or statement, \"The prayer is gathered\" based on what is \ntransmitted of the action of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). He says the takbir to begin as in all prayers. Then he \nbegins to recite silently the Fatiha and then a long bit of the Holy \nQur'an because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. \nIt is defined as being like Surat al-Baqara. The School is that it is \nrecommended to recite al-Baqara in the first standing of the first \nrak'at after the Fatiha. Opposite is the School that \"like\" indicates \nthat it is desirable and this sura is not particular. What it is \nmeant is the length. Then he does ruku' for the same length of \ntime, and then comes up. The Imam says \"Allah hears whoever \npraises Him\" and the follower says \"Our Lord, and praise is \nYours.\"  \n \n18.1c How it is done: second recitation  \n \nThen he recites another piece of the Holy Qur'an slightly \nshorter than the first. Then he goes into ruku' again for the \nsame amount of time as he spent reciting. Then he once \nmore stands upright saying, 'Sami Allahu liman hamidah'  \n \nThen, in the well-known position, he recites the Fatiha, which \ndiffers from Shaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi alaihi) who says \nthat he does not recite. The reason for that is that it is two rak'ats \nand the Fatiha is not repeated twice in the same rak'at. He recites \nless than he did in the first standing. It is recommended that it be \nal-'Imran. In his second ruku' he says the tashbih and does not \nrecite or make supplication.  \n \n18.1d How it is done: two sajdas \n  \nThen he does two full sajdas \n  \nHe does them with tranquillity. There are two positions about \nwhether they are long like the ruku'. The most well-known is the \nfirst. The second is in the Mukhtasar of Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). It seems probable.  \n \n18.1e How it is done: second rak'at  \n \nAfter this he stands up again and recites another piece of \nthe Holy Qur'an slightly shorter than the previous one and \nthen goes into ruku' for the same length of time. Then as \nbefore he stands upright again and recites one more \nslightly shorter piece of the Holy Qur'an which is followed \nby ruku' for the same amount of time as the recitation. He \nstands back upright again and then does two sajdas as \nbefore \n  \nHe recites the Fatiha and then a shorter piece, and it is \nrecommended that it be Surat an-Nisa'. Then after the third \nstanding, he goes into ruku' in which he glorifies and does not \nrecite or make supplication. Then he comes up and then recites \nthe Fatiha in the well-known position and then a shorter sura \nthan the third, and it is recommended that it be Surat al-Ma‟ida.  \n \n18.1f How it is done: tashahhud  \n \nFinally he says the tashahhud and then the salam \n  \nThis is the description which the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentioned. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is our \nSchool and the school of the majority. Its evidence are sound \nexplicit hadiths on this previous manner which our author \ndescribed. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he \nprays two rak'ats like other nafila prayers.  \n \n18.1g Can be done at home  \n \nIf you like the prayer can be done in this way in your own \nhouse \n  \nThe eclipse prayer can be done at home when that does not lead to \nabandoning it in the group. If doing that leading to not doing in \nthe group, then it is disliked to pray it at home. He then goes on to \nthe lunar eclipse.  \n \n18.2 The Lunar Eclipse  \n \n18.2a No group prayer  \n \nIf there is an eclipse of the moon there is no group prayer \n  \nThis is in the well-known position. It is transmitted from Shaikh \nal-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the prohibition is one of the \nnature of the haram. As for the group, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) forbid it \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did not gather a \ngroup for the lunar eclipse. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) allow it.  \n \n18.2b How it is done  \n \nWhen it happens people should pray individually, reciting \nout loud as for any other nafila prayer at night \n  \nPeople pray in their own in their houses in the well-known \nposition of the School. An opposite position is found in the report \nthat in al-Majmu'a that Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat they pray individually in the masjid. Recitation is out loud as \nfor other nafila, since it might be imagined that people pray in the \nform of the nafila without specific intention. It is possible that it \nhas the form of the solar eclipse. We read in at-Tahqiq, \"The \napparent meaning of the words of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) is that it does not need a specific intention like other \nnafilas as opposed to the solar eclipse which needs a particular \nintention. What is desired is obtained by two rak'ats only although \nit is desirable to pray groups of two rak'ats until it is finished. It's \ntime is the entire night. Its is not done when dawn comes.  \n \n18.3 The khutba after the prayer for the solar eclipse  \n \n18.3a No formal khutba  \n \nThere is no formal khutba after the prayer for the eclipse \nof the sun \n  \nThere is no khutba before or after the eclipse prayer because a \ngroup of the Companions transmitted the description of the \nEclipse prayer and none of them mentioned that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) gave a khutba in it. As for what is related \nfrom 'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) prayed the eclipse prayer and then went and \naddressed the people and praised and lauded Allah azza wa jall, it \nmeans that he spoke some words which contained the praise of \nAllah azza wa jall and the prayer on the Prophets (may Allah azza \nwa jall bless them all) and admonition as would be found in a \nkhutba.  \n \n18.3b Informal admonition  \n \nbut there is no harm in the Imam taking the opportunity to \nadmonish and remind people \n  \nHe reminds people about the calamities which happen in this \nworld because of disobeying Allah azza wa jall. It differs from \nwhat is before it because the khutba has no meaning except this. \nIt is not the particular form of the khutba. The Mukhtasar says \nthat reminding is only recommended.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Nineteen: On the Rain Prayer \n \n \nClarification of the time when it is done, which is in the early \nmorning until the sun declines. He clarifies the place where it is \ndone, which is the desert. Its name, istisqa' linguistically means to \nask for drink and in the Shari‟ah it is to ask Allah azza wa jall for \nwater because of drought which has occurred.  \n \n19.1 Its judgment  \n \nThe rain prayer is a sunnah which is acted upon \n  \nThe Rain prayer is a sunnah which it is confirmed should be \nprayed, and is not abandoned. This differs from Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) who says it is not prescribed. The evidence \nfor its being prescribed is what is in the two Sahih collections: that \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) went out to the place of \nprayer and prayed for rain from Allah azza wa jall. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) faced the qibla and reversed his cloak and prayed \ntwo rak'ats in which the recitation was out loud. There is no \ndisagreement that the supplication is after changing the cloak and \nafter facing the qibla and after the prayer.  \n \n19.2 Who performs it  \n \nThe Imam goes out for the prayer  \n \nOne variant has the \"Imam and the people\". It appears to be \ngeneral, but that it not the case. They are divided into those who \ngo out for it and those who do not go out for into three groups. One \ngroup go out to it by agreement: they are the legally responsible \nMuslims, even if they are slaves or women who normally go out \nand children with understanding. One group do not go out for it by \nagreement: young women and menstruating women. There is a \ngroup about whom there is disagreement: they are the children \nwho do not understand, young women who are not tempting and \nthe people of the dhimma. The well-known position for other than \nthe people of the dhimma is that they do not go out. The well-\nknown position for the people of the dhimma is that they go out \nwith the people, not before or after them. They do not mix with the \npeople, but are to one side.  \n \nIt is recommended that the Imam command the people to repent \nand avoid injustices. That is before they go to the place of prayer \nbecause sins are a cause for misfortunes. Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Whatever strikes you of an affliction is by what your hands \nearned.\" (Holy Qur‟an 42:30) The reason for denying the answer, \nas has come in hadith was made clear by Shaikh al-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) when he says, \"The dusty disheveled slave \nstretches out his hands to the heaven, 'O Lord, O Lord' while his \nfood is haram, his clothing is haram and he is nourished by the \nharam, so how can he be answered like that?\" He commanded \nthem to give sadaqa and charity. It is recommended to fast thee \ndays before the rain prayer and they go out in ragged clothes and \nhumility with tranquillity and gravity. The well-known position is \nthat the Imam says the takbir when they go out to it.  \n \n19.3 Its time  \n \nin the early morning as for the ‘Id prayers \n  \nIt is probable that the resemblance is in the prayer-place, i.e. the \nImam goes out to the prayer place as he goes out for the „Id, for \nother than the people of Makka. They pray for rain in the Masjid \nal-Haram as they pray in it. Then he says, \"morning\" to clarify the \ntime of going out.  \n \n19.4 How it is done  \n \n19.4a Two rak'ats  \n \nHe leads the people in two rak’ats  \n \nWhen the Imam reaches the prayer-place, he leads the people in \nonly two rak'ats by agreement of those who say that it is \nprescribed. It is permitted to do nafila before and after it. Shaikh \nibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted that that it disliked \nfrom Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) by analogy with the \n„Id prayer. The one who says that it is permitted distinguishes the \nrain prayer as being intended to seek nearness by good actions to \nremove punishment, which is not like the „Id prayer.  \n \n19.4b Recitation  \n \nin which the recitation is out loud. He recites Surat al-A'la \nin the first rak’at and Surat ash-Shams in the second. He \ndoes two sajdas and one ruku' in each rak’at and finishes \nwith the tashahhud and the salam \n  \nIt is agreed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) recited \nout loud in them. In the first rak'at he recites the Fatiha and Al-\nA'la (Holy Qur‟an 87) in it, and the like of that in the second with \nthe Fatiha and ash-Shams (Holy Qur‟an 91). These two suras are \nmentioned because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nrecited them in it. There are two prostration‟s in each rak'at. \nThere is one ruku' is avoid being like the eclipse prayer. When he \nfinishes the final prostration, he does the tashahhud and salam.  \n \n19.5 The khutba  \n \nHe then turns and faces the people. When everyone is quiet \nhe stands and, leaning on a bow-shaft or staff, gives two \nkhutbahs sitting down between them \n  \nIt is desirable while he is sitting on the earth. He does not ascend \na minbar because this situation demands humility. When they are \nstill in their places, it is recommended that he stand and begin to \nspeak. The two khutbahs in the Rain Prayer resembles that on the \ntwo „Ids in that they are after the prayer and he sits in them at \nthe beginning and second. That is what the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did.  \n \n19.6 Changing the cloak  \n \nWhen he finishes he faces the qibla and then turns his \ncloak inside out, putting what was on his right shoulder on \nhis left shoulder and vice versa. He does not turn it upside \ndown. Everyone else does the same except that he is \nstanding and they remain seated \n  \nWhen he finishes the khutba, he faces the qibla where he is and \nchanges his cloak, for luck, to indicate the change of their state \nfrom hardship to ease. This is what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did. He does not turn his cloak upside down. Shaikh \nSanad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that because that is not recorded \nfrom him nor from anyone after him. The description of turning is \nto put the lower edge on the top and the top on the bottom, based \non what is in that of bad luck in respect for His words, \"We turned \nthe place completely upside down.\" (Holy Qur‟an 15:74) As for \nchanging what is on the right to the left, it is only possible by \nturning it inside out. Then the men but not the women do the like \nof that of the Imam, if they have cloaks and change their cloaks \nwhile seated. The Imam changes it while standing.  \n \n19.7 Supplication  \n \nThen, while like this, the Imam makes du'a after which he \nand everyone else leave \n  \nThis is done while he is standing facing qibla. It is done out loud \nand the supplication is of medium length, neither long nor short. \nPart of the Holy Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) supplication \nwas, \"O Allah, give water to Your slaves and animals and spread \nyour mercy and give life to your dead land.\" It is recommended for \nthe one who is near to the Imam to say \"Amin\" after his \nsupplication and to raise his hands with the palms towards the \nearth, looking at the sky. Then according to the well-known \nposition they leave. It is said that he returns facing the people, \nreminding them and supplicating, and they say Amin to his \nsupplication and then go.  \n \n19.7a No takbirs  \n \nThere are no special takbirs in this prayer or in the eclipse \nprayer. There is just the takbir al-ihram and the normal \ntakbirs for going into ruku' and for going into sujud and \ncoming back out of it. There is no adhan or iqama for the \nrain prayer \n  \nThere is no takbir in the khutba. Takbir is replaced with asking \nforgiveness. He says, \"I ask the forgiveness of Allah the Immense. \nThere is no god but Him, the Living, the Self-Subsistent, and I \nturn to Him.\" In the two khutbahs, he often says, \"Ask for the \nforgiveness of Your Lord. He is Forgiving and will send the rain on \nyou in torrents, support you with wealth and sons, appoint \ngardens for you, and make rivers flow for you.\"  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty \nOn what to do when someone is at the point of \ndeath and on washing the dead, shrouding \nthem, embalming them, carrying them and \nburying them \n \n \n20.1 Attendance at death  \n \n20.1a Turning the person towards qibla  \n \nWhen someone is at the point of death, it is recommended \nto turn them so that they face qibla and to close their eyes \nafter they have died \n  \nWhen the signs of death appear in a person and it is certain that \nhe will die, he is turned: that is when the eyes become fixed. It is \ndisliked to do that before. What is meant by facing qibla is to put \nhim on his right side with his chest towards the qibla. It is said \nthat that at that point one says, \"In the name of Allah and on the \nSunnah of the Rasulullah and peace be upon the Messengers and \npraise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Let those who \nwork, work for the like of this (i.e. death) The like of this is not \ndenied.\" It is also recommended to tie the jaw with a bandage, \nbind the limbs gently, lift him from the earth, cover him with a \ncloth, place something heavy on his abdomen like a sword, and to \nrecount the shahadah to him.  \n \n20.1b Saying the shahadah  \n \nThe shahadah should be said in the presence of the dying \nperson so they will be reminded of it \n  \nThis is done before he actually dies. The previous things are for \nthe person who has died. This instruction is that someone sitting \nwith him says so that he can hear, \"La ilaha ill‟Allah. \nMuhammadun Rasulullah.\" This is done when the signs of death \nappear. He is taught so that he will remember them in his mind \nand die acknowledging them in his consciousness. When the dying \nperson says them, they are not repeated to him unless he is \nspeaking a foreign language and then they are repeated to him so \nthat that will be the last of his words and he will enter the Garden \nby what is related: \"If the last words of a person are 'la ilaha \nill‟Allah,' he will enter the Garden.\" One does not say, \"Say: 'la \nilaha ill‟Allah' because he might be in a conflict with Shaitan who \nsays, 'Die on the din of the Jews or Christians,' and he says 'No,' \nand then people will have a bad opinion of him.]  \n \n20.1c Purity of the body  \n \nIt is better that the body and what it is on are free of \nimpurity. It is better that menstruating women or anyone \nin a state of janaba do not come near someone who is dying \n  \nIt is desirable that what is on and under the body and the body \nitself be pure, if that is possible. The reason is that the angels will \nbe present with him. It is recommended that menstruating women \nor those in janaba do not come near the dying person because the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said that the angels do not \nenter a house in which there is a menstruating woman or someone \nin janaba. It is desirable that no dogs or images or anything that \nangels dislike be brought near him.  \n \n20.1d Reading Sura Yasin  \n \nSome of the 'ulama' recommend reading Surat Yasin at the \nbedside of the dying person although according to Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) this was not the usual practice \n  \n'Some' means Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is read at \nhis head or feet or elsewhere. Surat Yasin is read because it is \nrelated that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There \nis no one who dies who has Surat Yasin read at his head but that \nAllah makes it easy for him.\" This recitation is not mentioned by \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). He considers it disliked, and \nthat Surat Yasin is not singled out. He considers it disliked to \nrecite Surat Yasin or any other sura when a person is dying, after \nhis death or at his grave. It is also disliked to instruct him after he \nhas been placed in the grave.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is disliked to recite the \nHoly Qur'an beside a dying person and to recite it beside the dead \nperson or at his burial. It is also disliked to burn aromatic \nsubstances.  \n \n20.1e Weeping  \n \nThere is no harm in weeping when someone dies although \nself-control and patient endurance are better if that is \npossible \n  \nThere is no harm in weeping when the person is dying or after his \ndeath. Self-control in what has happened is good and better if \npossible. He is helped in that by looking at the reward for \nafflictions in ayats and hadiths which are related about that. One \nis them is the words of the Almighty, \"But give good news to the \nsteadfast: those who, when disaster strikes them, say, 'We belong \nto Allah and will return to Him.' Those are the ones who will have \nblessings and mercy from their Lord.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:155-156) \nThe blessings and mercy of Allah azza wa jall are not equal to any \nof the things connected to this world. In hadith: \"Whoever says \nthat and says with it, 'O Allah, reward me for my loss and replace \nit with better than it,' Allah will do that for him.\"  \n \n20.1f Wailing is forbidden  \n \nand crying out and wailing are forbidden \n  \nBased on the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \n\"The one beats his cheek and tears his garments and calls out \nwith the call of the Jahiliyya is not one of us.\" In a variant of \nMuslim, \"When the wailer does not repent before she dies, she will \nbe raised up on the Day of Rising with trousers of pitch and a shirt \nof mange.  \n \n20.2 Washing the body  \n \n20.2a Number of times  \n \nThere is no fixed limit to the number of times you wash a \ndead body. The body should be thoroughly cleaned and the \nnumber of times it is washed should be odd \n  \nExcept for the martyr in battle according to Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), but what is desired is that the body be clear \nand that it be washed an odd number of times. The reply is that \nthe limit is that which should not be exceeded or decreased, and \nthe odd is three, five or seven. In short, the cleaning defined by \nthe number three does not have the limitation of a particular \nnumber since it is known that the odd contains three, five, etc. It \nis recommended that the washing be odd except not only one time, \nwhich is not desirable. The principle of the Sunnah washing is \nbased on what is well-known and it does not need an intention. It \nis also said that it is obligatory and confirmed, i.e. on society as a \nwhole, which is preferred, and it is done as an act of worship, not \nfor cleanness in the well-known position. It is said that it is for \ncleanness. It is clear that the result of the dispute is that when a \nMuslim man dies, and there is no Muslim with him but there is a \nDhimmi with him, according to the statement that it is worship, \nthe Dhimmi does not wash him because he is not one of the people \nof worship. According to the second one, that it is for cleanness, \nthe Dhimmi washes him.  \n \n20.2b What is used for washing  \n \nIt should be washed with water and Sidr (Lote tree leaves) \nand in the last washing camphor should be added to the \nwater \n  \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it means that \nall of the scholars say that crushed Lote leaves should be dissolved \nin water and then the body of the corpse rubbed with it. It is like \nthat in every washing except the first. In it there must be clear \nwater for the obligatory ghusl. In the last washing it is \nrecommended to add camphor because the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) commanded that if there is no camphor, then \nanother perfume takes its place. When there is no Lote, then \nsaltwort and the like is used instead.  \n \n20.2c Covering the private parts  \n \nDuring the washing the body's private parts should be kept \ncovered \n  \nWhen the dead person is stripped to be washed, the private parts \nshould be covered. What Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nunderstands from the Mudawwana are the actual private parts in \nparticular. The accepted position is that it is what is between the \nwaist and the knees, as is transmitted from Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ntransmitted from Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the \nchest and face are covered, fearing change which could give rise to \nbad opinion.  \n \n20.2d Cutting nails and hair \n \nThe nails should not be cut nor should the hair be shaved \noff \n  \nIf it is done, it is disliked to do this and they are included with him \nin his shroud.  \n \n20.2e Squeezing the stomach  \n \nThe stomach should be gently squeezed \n  \nIt is recommended to do this before washing if it is needed. It is \ndone gently lest any thing of it come out and soil the shroud.  \n \n20.2f Wudu'  \n \nIt is good if wudu' is done for the dead person although \nthis is not obligatory \n \nIt is recommended and does not require an intention because he is \ndoing it for someone else. It is not obligatory, which indicates that \nthere are two positions in the question. It indicated the first when \nhe says it is good, and he rejected the second by saying that it is \nnot obligatory, even if something impure issues from him after \nwashing. It is removed and he is not washed again nor is wudu' \ndone for him. Only the place is washed.  \n \n20.2g Position of the corpse  \n \nIt is better if the body is turned on its side for washing \nalthough it is acceptable to wash it in a sitting position \n  \nIt is better than sitting it up because it is easier to clean and \nkinder to the corpse. He first puts him on his left side and then \nwashes the right side, and then turns him on the right side and \nwashes the left side. This is recommended although sitting is \nallowed. Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefers it \nbecause he more able to wash thoroughly.  \n \n20.2h It is good for a spouse to wash  \n \nIt is good for a husband or wife to wash their dead partner \nalthough it does not necessarily have to be them that do it \n  \nThere is no harm here if another is chosen. Either of the couple \nhas priority in the washing of the one who has died over other \nrelatives so that he is adjudged to be able to do it if the relatives \ndispute about it. The basis for it is what is mentioned about 'Ali \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) washing Fatima (radhi‟Allahu anha) and Abu \nBakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) being washed by his wife.  \n \n20.2i Who washes a woman without relatives or other \nwomen  \n \nIf a woman dies on a journey and there are no other \nwomen present nor any men of mahram status then a man \nshould do tayammum for her, wiping her face and hands \n  \nIf a Muslim woman dies and there are no Muslim women or male \nrelatives present, but there are unrelated men, a man does \ntayammum for her, wiping the hands only to the wrists because \nthey are not part of 'awra and so it is permitted to look at them \nwithout lust. Shaikh az-Zurqani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It is \npermitted for a unrelated man to wipe her when she is lifeless \nbecause of the rarity of pleasure here. The one who prays only \ndoes tayammum after finishing the tayammum of the corpse \nbecause it is the time of the prayer.\"  \n \n20.2j Who washes such a man  \n \nSimilarly if the dead person is a man and there are no \nother men present nor a woman of mahram status, then a \nwoman should do tayammum for him, wiping his face and \nhis hands and arms to the elbows. If there is a woman of \nmahram status present she should wash his body, keeping \nhis 'awra covered \n  \nWhen there is a woman who is a relative present, she washes him, \ncovering the 'awra according to one of two interpretations in the \nMudawwana. It is sound because his body is not forbidden for \nthem to see. So it is permitted for her to look at a male relative \nexcept for what is between the waist and knees. Touching is \nanalogous with looking by necessity. The other interpretation is \nthat his entire body is veiled.  \n \n20.2k When a woman's mahram is present  \n \nIf a woman has died and there is a man of mahram status \npresent he should wash her through a cloth covering her \nwhole body \n  \nWhen there is no woman with her, a relative or in-law washes her \naccording to what is in the Mudawwana. Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he does not wash her, but performs \ntayammum. The form of washing is that water is poured on her \nand he does not touch her body with his hand either above or \nunder the cloth.  \n \n20.3 Shrouding  \n \n20.3a Number  \n \nIt is recommended for the body to be shrouded in an odd \nnumber of lengths of cloth, either three, five or seven. Any \nwaist-wrapper, shirt or turban that is put on the body is \ncounted as one piece of cloth. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) was shrouded in three lengths of white sahuli \ncloth, each layer being well wrapped round him. \n  \nThis is with the exception of the martyr in battle. He is silent \nabout what is obligatory, which is a garment which covers the \nentire body. It is clear from his words that seven is recommended \nfor both men and women. It is in al-Mukhtasar and it is what is \naccepted. Seven is recommended especially for woman, and more \nthan five for a man is disliked. Since he feared that that would be \nlimited to what is used to wrap the body, he removed the possible \nmisconception by saying that that includes garments. Then he \nindicates the recommendation of the odd number based on the \nHoly Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) example. \"Sahuli\" refers to \na type of cotton which is washed or it refers to a town in Yemen.  \n \n20.3b Just a shirt and turban  \n \nThere is no harm in a dead man being dressed in a shirt \nand a turban \n  \nNo harm here means it is better to do it. There is a text in the \nMukhtasar that it is recommended, i.e. each of them is \nrecommended, not that it is one recommendation. The turban is \nrecommended for a man, and one leaves the end of it an arm's \nlength to put over his face. A woman has no turban. A head \ncovering is put on her head and the end of it left to put on her face. \nThe best shroud is white cotton or linen. But cotton is better \nbecause it is more concealing and because the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) was shrouded in it. It is disliked to use yellow or \ngreen scent and every color except white. The place of dislike is \nwhen it is possible to have white. Otherwise it is not. Shrouding, \nthe perfume and preparing it is advanced before the debt - except \nfor the pawn and bequest. However, if there is a pledge against \nthe debt, it is permitted to the pledgee. The pledged debt is \nadvanced over the cost of preparation.  \n \n20.3c Use of perfume  \n \nThe body should be perfumed, with the perfume being put \nbetween the layers of cloth that make up the shroud and \nalso directly on the body and the places which touch the \nground in sujud \n  \nIt is recommended to perfume the corpse with perfume, which is \nnot forbidden and is customary. It is recommended to dry the body \nwith a clean rag before it is perfumed, and it is recommended that \nits clothes be fumigated an odd number of times, three, five, or \nseven and the like. Hanut, which is perfume like musk, amber or \ncamphor is put between the shrouds, i.e. on each layer except the \ntop, and on the body, like the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and nostrils \nby spreading it on cotton and putting it on his eyes, ears, nose and \norifices without putting it in, and also on the places of prostration: \nbrow, neck, knees, hands and toes of the feet.  \n \n20.4 Martyrs, suicides and executed criminals  \n \n20.4a Martyrs  \n \nA shahid on the battlefield is not washed nor is the prayer \ndone for him, he is buried in his clothes \n  \nA martyr is anyone who dies by weapons in battle against the \nunbelievers when there is a battle. Similar to being killed by \nactual weapons is dying because of being trampled by a horse, \nfalling from a camel, or attacking the enemy and falling into a \nwell or falling from a precipice. The apparent meaning of his \nwords is that he is not prayed over if he is killed by the enemy in \nthe land of Islam. That is the well-known position. Opposite it is \nthat he says if he is in the land of Islam, he is washed and prayed \nover because his degree is less than that of the martyr who has \nentered enemy territory. If he is carried live from the battle and \nthen dies, the well-known position is that he washed and prayed \nover, even if the fighter is wounded when he is removed, unless he \nis on the point of death and does not eat or drink. This is the \nsummary of the words of some of the commentaries of Shaikh \nKhalil (rahmatullahi alaihi). But the School is that the one who is \nwounded is not washed whether he is removed unconscious or not, \nexcept the one who has fainted.  \n \nAs he is not washed or prayed over, he is buried in his clothes with \nleather socks and a cap and a belt of little value and it is \npermitted, or a ring of little value. But not the armor and \nweapons: they are taken from him. He does not have anything \nelse. If his clothes are not enough to cover him, they are increased \nso that he is will covered as obligatory. Similarly it is obligatory to \nshroud him when he is found naked. The martyr is not washed by \nthe words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"Wrap them \nin their garments. The color is the color of blood and the scent is \nthe scent of musk,\" meaning that with Allah azza wa jall the smell \nof blood is pleasing like the smell of musk. For that reason, he is \nnot washed and the blood is not removed from him. He is not \nprayed over by what was said to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \"Do you convey that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) prayed over Hamza (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and said 50 \ntakbirs?\" He replied, \"No, and he (alaihi salat wa salam) did not \npray over any of the martyrs.\" It was in the Muwatta' that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) led the people in prayer over \nhim as individuals and did not lead anyone in the prayer. Qadi \n„Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said the sound position which the \nmajority hold is that the prayer of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) was a real prayer, not only supplication. It is said that \nwhat is meant by the prayer over him is supplication only. Shaikh \nal-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said its reason is that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) was better than every martyr \nwhose excellence dispenses with the prayer over him. The martyr \ncannot be washed since that would remove the blood which must \nremain because of its goodness and because it is a token of his \nmartyrdom in the Next World.  \n \n20.4b Suicides  \n \nIf someone kills himself, the prayer is done for him \n  \nThis is whether it is suicide or an accident. His wrong action is \nhis. The people of virtue pray over him when it is accidental, but \nnot when it is deliberate.   \n \n20.4c Those who have been executed  \n \nThe prayer is also done for someone killed by the Imam as \na hadd punishment or because they have killed someone. \nThe Imam himself does not participate in the prayer \n  \nWhen someone has been killed by obligation, as for abandoning \nthe prayer on account laziness and the highwayman, and those \nwho have to be stoned for sodomy or adultery, or whom the Imam \nhas killed for a hadd or in retaliation, neither the Imam nor the \npeople of virtue pray over him. The Imam and the people of virtue \ndo not pray over him so that that will be a deterrent to others \nagainst doing the like of what he did when they see the Imams \nand people of virtue refuse to pray over him.  \n \n20.5 Bringing the dead to the grave  \n \n20.5a No incense and walking in front  \n \nIncense should not be burned during funeral processions \nand it is better to walk in front of the bier \n  \nIncense is not used because it involves fire and the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) forbade that. It is better for men to walk in \nfront than to walk behind. If they ride, it is recommended for them \nto go behind the bier. The evidence for the first is what is related \nby the people of the Sunan from the hadith of Ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) who said, \"I saw the Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) walk in front of the bier.\" The evidence for the second is \nwhat Abu Dawud (radhi‟Allahu anhu) related that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The rider travels behind the \nfuneral.\"  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): It should not be too slow. \nWomen go at the very end. The bier should not be brought into the \nmasjid.  \n \n20.5b The body is placed on its right side  \n \nThe body should be placed in the grave on its right side \n  \nIt is recommended that the corpse be placed on its right side \nfacing qibla because it is the noblest of positions. The right hand is \nextended over his body and the head put level with earth. Earth is \nput behind and in front of it so that it does not move. The binding \nof the shroud is undone. If he cannot be put on his right side, then \nhe is put on his back with his face towards qibla. If that is not \npossible, then however is possible, If his direction shifts in the \nburial, as when it is put not to qibla or on the left side and not too \nlong has passed, that is remedied and he is moved. A long time \nmeans when the burial is complete.  \n \n20.5c Clay and straw placed over the corpse  \n \nand slabs made of clay and straw should be laid over it \n  \nAfter the dead person is placed in the grave, then bricks are put \nover him. That is based on the transmission that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) made the grave of his son Ibrahim \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and put bricks on the grave. It is \nrecommended to plug the gaps since he (alaihi salat wa salam) \ncommanded that about his son.  \n \n20.5d What is said  \n \nWhen this is done you should say, \"O Allah, our companion \nis now with You. He has left this world behind him and is \nin need of what is with You. O Allah, make his speech firm \nwhen he is questioned and do not test him in his grave \nbeyond what he can bear. Grant that he may be in the \ncompany of the Holy Prophet, Muhammad (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) \n  \nWhen the corpse is in the grave or those present have buried him, \nand the bricks are in place then this is said.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that those who are next \nto the grave throw in handfuls of earth \n  \n20.6 Monuments  \n \nIt is disliked to build anything on graves or to whitewash \nthem \n  \nIt appears that this is absolute, but that is not the case. There are \ndetails about this. In short, what is disliked is when it is in \nwasteland or owed so that the people of corruption cannot resort \nto it nor is pride intended by it and so distinction is intended by it. \nIt is also unlawful in waqf land absolutely, like al-Qarafa. He said \nin at-Tahqiq, \"It is obligatory for the governor to command that it \nbe demolished.\" Whitewashing is also disliked because it is found \nin Sahih Muslim that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade that the grave be whitewashed and that it be built on or \nsat on.   \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): the tumulus should not be \nraised more than one hand above the trench and should be shaped \nlike a camel's back although some dislike this and say it should be \nflat. There should be no fence around the grave. A tombstone is \npermitted as a market or a piece of wood, but this must not have \nany writing with the name, date or death, qualities of the person, \netc.  \n \n20.7 Burying an unbelieving father  \n \nA Muslim should not wash his father if he is not a Muslim \nnor should he put him in his grave unless he is afraid that \nhis body will remain unburied in which case he should \ncover the body and then bury it \n  \nBecause washing is only done for the one over whom the prayer is \nsaid. An unbeliever is not prayed over and so there is no point in \nwashing him. The prohibition is one of forbidding, and applies \neven more so to others than his father. Nor does he put him in his \ngrave because his filial duty is removed with the death of his \nfather. This is unless he fears that he will be left unburied. Then \nit is a duty to bury the body, and there is no difference between a \nunbeliever with whom we are at war and others. This does not \nonly apply to the father, but the obligation is general, extending \neven to the stranger. He is not made to face qibla because he is not \none of its people.  \n \n20.8 Niche in the grave  \n \nAccording to the people of knowledge the lahd-type (niche) \ngrave is better than the Shaqq-type (a simple trench). A \nlahd-type grave is one in which, after you have dug the \nbasic trench, you dig out a place for the body at the bottom \nof the side which faces qibla so that the body is protected \nby an overhang. This should be done provided that the \nearth is firm enough and will not crumble or cave in. This \nwas how the grave of the Holy Prophet  (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) was dug. \n  \nThis is based on the tradition, \"The lahd is for us and the Shaqq \nfor others\" and because Allah azza wa jall chose it for His Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). If the ground is too soft or sandy, then the \nShaqq is better.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): Graves should not be too \ndeep, not more than a cubit.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-One: On the Funeral Prayer \nand the Supplication for the Dead \n \n \nShaikh ibn 'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the position of \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that janaza is the bier and \njanaza is the dead person. Shaikh ibn al-Asma'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said the opposite. Shaikh al-Farra' (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that they mean the same. Shaikh ibn Qutayba (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said janaza is the corpse. Shaikh al-A'rabi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that janaza is the bier. It is derived from janaza, when \nsomething becomes heavy, or from covering something and so it is \nappropriate.  \n \nThe chapter also clarifies the judgment of the prayer on the dead \nperson which is fard kifayah. He can be prayed over at any time, \nday or night, except sunrise and sunset: it is forbidden at those \ntimes. It is disliked in the disliked time. In the first case it is \nrepeated as long as he has not been buried. It is not repeated in \nthe second at all. The place of that is when change is not feared for \nhim. Otherwise the prayer is permitted without dispute.  \n \nEvery dead Muslim is prayed for who was not a martyr in battle. \nThere is no prayer over someone who has already been prayed \nover already. The prayer over him is led by the one he commanded \nto do it. Such a person is preferred to the local authority if he is \nknown to be good and the blessing of his supplication is hoped for \nunless it is know that there was enmity between him and the \ndeceased. Then it is not permitted to designate him.  \n \n21.1 The Pillars of the Funeral Prayer  \n \nThe pillars of the janaza prayer are five:  \n \nStanding. If they pray sitting, it is not allowed except on account \nof a valid excuse (like illness). This is according to the position \nthat it is obligatory. The evidence for the obligation is understood \nfrom His words, \"Do not ever pray over any of them who die\" (Holy \nQur‟an 9:84) based on the understanding which is opposite the \njudgment of what is said: it is that the obligation of praying over \nthe believers is not contrary to the judgment articulated, which is \nlack of respect of the prayer over the believers.  \n \nThe ihram, i.e. the intention  \n \nThe salam.  \n \nSupplication.  \n \nThe takbirs.  \n \n21.2 How to do the prayer  \n \n21.2a Four takbirs  \n \nThe janaza (funeral) prayer contains four takbirs \n  \nSince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. That is \nsince it was confirmed that in the last prayer that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) prayed, he said four takbirs. If he \nsays the salam after three out of forgetfulness and then \nremembers soon after, he returns with only the intention, and he \ndoes not say that takbir since that would increase the number. He \nsays that the takbir and count it as one of the four. Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. If the Imam does \nan extra fifth, the followers says the salam and do not wait for \nhim. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that. \nShaikh ibn Harun (rahmatullahi alaihi) opposed that, saying that \nwhen the Imam stands for the fifth out of forgetfulness, they wait \nfor him so that they say the salam with his salam. Shaikh al-\nMawwaq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he heard Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) say that if the Imam is one of those \nwho say the takbir five times, the followers stop after the fourth \nand do not follow him in the fifth. It is understood that if he is one \nof those who do not say five takbirs, but he says a fifth \ninadvertently, then the follower does not stop, but he remains \nstill. When the Imam says the salam, the follower says his salam. \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that in al-Wadiha as does \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n21.2b Lifting the hands for the first takbir  \n \nYou lift your hands for the first takbir and there is no \nharm in doing so for each of the others \n  \nThis is one of four statements and it is made by Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He said that he raises his hands in the first \nand can choose in the rest. If he wishes, he raises them. If he \nwishes, he does not raise them. The second position is that he \nraises them in every takbir. This is in the Mudawwana and \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred it. The third, \nwhich is also in the Mudawwana, is that he raises them only in \nthe first takbir, and raising them in the others is contrary to the \nfirst. Shaikh at-Tunisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred it. The \nfourth is that he only raises them in the first and not others. It is \nmore well-known than raising them in all.  \n \nIt was already stated that the supplication is one of the pillars of \nthe prayer, and so the prayer is repeated if it is omitted. There is \ndisagreement about the supplication after the fourth. Shaikh \nSahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) affirmed it by analogy with the rest \nof the takbirs. The rest of the people opposed him by making an \nanalogy with lack of recitation after the fourth rak'at because the \nfour takbirs take the place of the four rak'ats, i.e. the social form \nof the four takbirs with what they contain of supplication takes \nthe place of the four rak'ats, and as there is no recitation after the \nfourth rak'at, so there is no supplication after the fourth takbir. It \ndoes not mean that each takbir is in the position of a rak'at, which \nit observed alone or with the supplication. The probable meaning \nof the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that he can choose.  \n \n21.2c Supplication after the fourth rak'at  \n \nIf you like you can make a du'a after the fourth takbir \nbefore the salam or if you like, you can say the salam \ndirectly after the takbir \n  \n A third position.  \n \nNOTE: The Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not speak about the \nintention, which is one of the pillars. It is that he intends with his \nheart to pray over this deceased person while remembering that it \nis a fard kifayah. There is no harm that he neglects the final point. \nIt is valid as it is valid if he prays over him believing that it is \npraises and there is remembrance, and the reverse. That is also \nthe case if he thinks it is someone and then it becomes evident \nthat it is someone else because his intention was the person \npresent before him. This is not the case when there are two or \nmore on the bier and believes that there is only one. It is repeated \nby all since the one was not specific. Otherwise, it is repeated over \nthe one who was not specified whom he intended. If he intends one \nparticular one and then it becomes clear it is two or more, and the \none he named was not of them the one, then it is repeated over all. \nIf he intends the prayer on whoever is in bier while he believes it \nto be a group and then it is clear that it is one or two, it is sound \nbecause one or two are part of a group.  \n \n21.2d Where the Imam stands  \n \nThe Imam stands opposite the middle of the body if the \ndead person is a man and opposite the shoulders if it is a \nwoman \n  \nIt is recommended that the Imam stand here, and it is the same \nfor the one alone. These details are known in the Maliki School. \nShaikh ibn Sha'ban (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that for a man and \nwoman he stands wherever he likes.  \n \n21.2e The salam  \n \nThe salam for this prayer is said once quietly both by the \nImam and those following him \n  \nIn the well-known position. One position has 'quietly\" and so one \ncombines and says it quietly. This is for both the Imam and \nfollower. This differs from what is in the Mudawwana that the \nImam says the salam of the janaza so that the one next to him can \nhear it. The one following says the salam so that only he can hear. \nIf the one next to him hears it, there is no harm.  \n \n21.3 Reward for the prayer and attendance  \n \nThere is a great reward to be gained from doing the prayer \nand for being present at the burial. This reward is \nequivalent in size to Mount Uhud \n  \nThis is clarified in the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) in the Sahih, \"Whoever follows a janaza of a Muslim in \nbelief and expectation, and remains with it until he prays over it \nand leaves after it is buried returns with a reward of two qirats. \nEach qirat is like Uhud. Whoever prays over it and then returns \nbefore he is buried he returns with a qirat.\"  \n \n21.4 The first three supplications  \n \n21.4a No specific formula  \n \nThere is no specific formula for the du'a to be made when \ndoing the funeral prayer \n  \nThere is nothing specific because there are various supplications \nrelated from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and the \nCompanions in that. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand others relate the agreement that no specific supplication is \nrecommended. That is followed by the fact that in the Muwatta' \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) recommends the supplication of \nAbu Hurayra (radhi‟Allahu anhu) which is: \"O Allah, he is Your \nslave and the son of your slave and the son of your woman slave. \nHe used to testify that there is no god but You alone with no \npartner and that Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) is Your slave \nand Your Messenger and You know him best. O Allah, if he is \ngood, then increase his goodness. If he did evil, overlook his evil \nactions. O Allah, do not deny us his reward and not tempt us after, \nhim.\"  \n \n21.4b All are possible  \n \nAll the things which have come down are acceptable \n  \nAny supplication is permissible, so say what you like.  \n \n21.4c One excellent form  \n \nOne good thing to say after doing the takbir is: Praise be to \nAllah who makes death and brings to life and praise be to \nAllah who brings the dead to life. To Him belong \nGreatness, Sovereignty, Power, Exaltedness and He has \npower over all things. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the \nfamily of Muhammad as You blessed and were merciful to \nand poured goodness on Ibrahim and the family of \nIbrahim. In all the worlds, You are Praiseworthy, Glorious. \n  \nAllah, he is your slave and the son of Your slaves. You \ncreated him and provided for him. You made him die and \nYou will bring him to life and You know best about his \noutward and his inward. We have come to You as \nintercessors \non \nhis \nbehalf \nso \nplease \naccept \nour \nintercession. O Allah, we seek safety for him by Your bond \nof protection with him. Certainly You keep Your word and \npromise. O Allah, protect him from the trials of the grave \nand from the torment of Jahannam. O Allah, forgive him, \nhave mercy on him, pardon him and grant him well-being. \nBe generous to him when he arrives and open the way \nwide for him to come in. Wash him with water, snow and \nice and cleanse him from his wrong actions as a white \ngarment is cleansed of dirt. Give him a home better than \nthe home he had, a family better than the family he had \nand a wife better than the wife he had. O Allah, if he was \nright-acting, increase him in right-actions and if he was \nwrong-doing, then overlook his wrong actions. O Allah, he \nhas come to You and You are the Best that anyone can \ncome to. He is in need of Your mercy and You have no need \nto punish him. O Allah, make his speech firm when he is \nquestioned and do not test him in his grave beyond what \nhe can bear. Do not deprive us of our reward for doing this \non his behalf and do not test us after him.  \n \n21.5 The fourth prayer  \n \nYou say this after each takbir and then after the fourth \ntakbir you say, 'O Allah, forgive those who are alive and \nthose who are dead, those present with us and those \nabsent, those who are young and those who are old, those \nwho are male and those who are female. You know \neverything that we do and where we will end up - and \nforgive our parents and those who have gone before us \nwith iman and all the Muslims both men and women and \nall the Muminun both men and women, the living and the \ndead. O Allah whoever of us You keep alive, keep him alive \nin iman and whoever You take back to Yourself take him \nback as a Muslim. Make us glad when we meet You. Make \nus pleasing at the time of our death and make death \npleasant for us. Make it a source of rest and happiness for \nus,' After this you say the salam.  \n \n21.6 If the dead person is a woman  \n \nIf the dead person is a woman you say, \"O Allah, she is your \nslave and the daughter of Your slaves\" and you go on \nmaking the object of the du'a feminine rather than \nmasculine. The only difference is that you do not say, \"Give \nher a husband better than her husband. . .\" because in the \nGarden she can be the wife of the man who was her \nhusband in this world and the women of the Garden are \nattached only to their husbands and have no desire for \nanyone else. A man may have many wives in the Garden \nwhereas women only have one husband  \n \nNOTE: If you do not know whether the dead person was male or \nfemale, you intend the prayer over the one who is present, as \nwhen you do not know whether it is one or several. You say in \nyour supplication, \"O Allah! They are your slaves and the sons of \nyour slaves,\" and use the masculine plural.  \n \n21.7 Praying over several at once  \n \nThere is no harm in having one funeral prayer for several \ndead people \n  \nThis means it is recommended by a group of scholars as opposed to \nthe one who said that they are not put together and that one prays \nover every dead person on his own. According to the statement \nthat there are several in the same prayer, in what form are the \ncorpses are laid out: is the best put near the Imam and others \ntowards qibla or are they put in one row with the best of them \nnear the Imam? The first is indicated.  \n \n21.7a The best arrangement of the bodies  \n \nIf there are both men and women among the dead, the men \nare placed next to the Imam. If there are only men, the best \nof them is placed next to the Imam. If there are women and \nchildren as well, they are placed behind the men in the \ndirection of the qibla  \n \nWhat he mentioned of putting women before children is based on \nthe position of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). Its \nopposite is well-known: it is that free adult men are near the \nImam, the best and then next best, and then young free men and \nthen hermaphrodites, then male slaves, then free women, then \nyoung girls, then female slaves.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) puts male slaves ahead of \nhermaphrodites  \n \n21.7b Second arrangement: placing them in a row  \n \nThere is no harm in a number of bodies being placed in a \nrow in which case the one nearest the Imam should be the \nbest of them \n  \nThis is when they are all the same type, like all men, all women, \nor all children. When there are men, women and children, the men \nare put in the row in front of the Imam, then children in a row, \nthen women in a row. This is in respect to the corpses. As for the \nImamate, the one with the most knowledge is put first, then the \nbest, then the oldest. Then he discussed when multiple burial is \nnecessary.  \n \n21.7c Multiple burial  \n \nIf a number of people are being buried in one grave the \nbest should be nearest the qibla \n  \nBased on what is in the four Sunan that Shaikh Abu Dawud \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nShaikh an-Nasa'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Ibn Majah \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said on the day of Uhud, \"Dig and make it wide and deep \nand good, and bury two and three in the same grave. Put the one \nwith \nthe \nmost \nHoly \nQur'an \nfirst.\" \nShaikh \nat-Tirmidhi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is sahih hasan. It is clear from \nthe words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is absolutely \npermitted to put them together in one grave in case of necessity or \notherwise. That is not the case. If necessity demands it, it is \npermitted. Otherwise, it is disliked. The permission is based on \nnecessity and that is dislike when it is not necessary when they \nare buried at the same time. If we want to bury a corpse on top of \nanother after he has been buried, that it is forbidden because the \ngrave holds the dead and he is not disinterred unless there is a \nnecessity in which case it is not forbidden.  \n \n21.8 Making up a missed prayer  \n \n21.8a When someone has been buried without the prayer  \n \nIf someone has been buried without the funeral prayer \nhaving been done for him and the grave has already been \nfilled in, then the prayer should be done over his grave  \n \nAccording to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that there is no prayer over \nhim. Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi), who is the better, \nsaid, \"As for what is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) prayed on the grave of the poor woman, that was special \nfor her or because he had promised her that he would pray over \nher. “According to the statement that there is a prayer at the \ngrave, it is said that the prayer is said over someone who probably \nwould not have decomposed. It is said that it is not permitted after \ntwo months. It is understood by his words that if the grave has not \nbeen filled in it, he is brought out and prayed over. Even if it has \nbeen filled in and buried, he must be brought out and prayed over \nas long as it is not feared that he has decomposed.  \n \n21.8b No second prayer  \n \nYou do not do the funeral prayer a second time if it has \nalready been done once \n  \nThis is disliked, whether the one who wants to pray the second \ntime is the one who prayed the first time or not.  \n \n21.8c The prayer over most of the body  \n \nThe funeral prayer is done for a person as long as the \nmajority of the body remains \n  \nMeaning two-thirds or more because the judgment of the majority \nis the judgment of the whole. He intends the prayer over all the \ndead person, what is present of him and what is absent. One does \nnot pray over half of a body according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). That is the accepted position, even if it is \nmore than a half and less than two-thirds because it would lead to \nprayer on the absent. A small absence is overlooked because it is \ninconsequential.  \n \n21.8d When only a little of the body is left  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion about whether you do the \nfuneral prayer for, for example, someone's hand or foot \n  \nThe example is applied to the thing itself. So he mentioned the \ndisagreement about the hand and foot. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that one does not pray over it because its owner may \nbe alive. Shaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that one \nprays over the hand or foot and intends the dead person by it, i.e. \nwhen it is probable that its owner is dead.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): It is permissible to visit \nburial places and there are no limitations upon acts of \nremembrance.  \n \nThe place where the dead are buried is legally a kind of habs (non-\nconveyable land). It cannot be sold or alienated or used for any \nother purpose. It is censurable to walk on or pass over a grave.  \n \nGraves should not be opened as long as there are any bones left. \nThey can be opened in certain cases:  \n \nwhere the shrouds were stolen;  \n \nwhere the burial was on someone's property without his \npermission and the owner reclaims his property;  \n \nwhere articles of value were overlooked at the time of burial.  \n \nThe dead should not be buried in silks, impure garments, or in \ngreen, blue, black or carthamine.  \n \nThe bier should not be unusually large or silken things put on it. \nLights should not follow the convoy. The name of the dead should \nbe announced in a loud voice in the masjid or at its door. Private \ninvitations can be sent. You do not have to stand when a convoy \npasses.  \n \nWhen a believer dies at sea, he is thrown into the sea after having \nbeen shrouded when there is no hope of making land before \ndecomposition sets in.  \nA Muslim may not follow an unbeliever to the grave or help to \nlower him in.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-two: On the Supplication \ndone for a Dead Child, how the funeral prayer \nis done for them and how they are washed \n \n \nThis chapter deals with judgments particular to children, meaning \na child who has at least cried out. He begins with the supplication \nwhich is made for him:  \n \n22.1The first three prayers  \n \nYou praise Allah tabaraka wa ta'ala and ask for blessing on \nHis Prophet Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam) and then you \nsay, \"O Allah, he is your slave and the son of Your slaves. \nYou created him and provided for him. You made him die \nand will bring him to life. Make him a forerunner and a \nstored-up treasure and a reward for his parents. Make \ntheir balances heavy through him and make their reward \ngreater because of him and do not deprive either us or \nthem of their reward through him and do not test either us \nor them after him. O Allah, give him the company of the \nright-acting Muminun who have gone ahead and place him \nunder the guardianship of Ibrahim. Give him a house \nbetter than the one he had and a family better than the one \nhe had. Save him from the trial of the grave and the \ntorment of Jahannam.\"  \n \nThis is said after each takbir except the fourth.  \n \n22.2 The fourth intercession  \n \nYou say this after each takbir and after the fourth you say, \n\"O Allah, forgive our forbears and predecessors and those \nwho have gone before us. O Allah, whoever among us You \nmake live make him live in iman and whoever You take \nback to Yourself take him back as a Muslim. Forgive all the \nMuslims both men and women and all the Muminun both \nmen and women, the living and the dead.\" Then you say the \nsalam \n  \nJust as the salam for the prayer.  \n \n22.3 Stillborn’s  \n \n22.3a No prayer  \n \nYou do not do the funeral prayer for a stillborn baby \n  \nThe still-born is the one who does not cry. Nor is he washed, even \nif he moves, urinates, sneezes or suckles for a little, but not a lot. \nIt is the sign a life. This prohibition is one of dislike. As for the one \nwho cries, he has all the judgments of the living, even if he dies \nimmediately, without dispute.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): it is not buried with \nperfumes or given a name.  \n \n22.3b Legal consequences  \n \nSuch a baby does not inherit and cannot be inherited from. \nIf a baby is prematurely stillborn, it is disliked for its body \nto be buried inside a house \n  \nInheritance is a branch of confirmation of life. So any gifts made \nto him before his birth are returned. He is not buried in the house \nbecause it is feared that if the house is destroyed, the bones will be \ndisinterred.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): if a stillborn child is buried in \nthe house, that does not prevent sale of the house.  \n \n22.4 Who should do the ghusl  \n \n22.4a Women washing boys  \n \nThere is no harm in women washing the body of a young \nboy of six or seven years old \n  \nThey do not wash them when they are old. At such an age, it is not \nobliged for them to cover the private parts because it is permitted \nfor the women to look at the body.  \n \n  \n22.4b Men do not wash girls  \n \nBut men do not wash the bodies of young girls. There is a \ndifference of opinion regarding young girls who have not \nreached an age when they might be desired but the former \njudgment is the one preferred by us \n  \nThe prohibition against men washing a girl is one of forbidding by \nagreement if she is one of those who might be desirable, like six or \nseven. They can wash her if she is still a small baby by agreement, \ni.e. less than three years. There is some disagreement about those \nwho have not reached the age of desirably, Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) permits it by analogy with the women \nwashing a young boy, but Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) forbids it. It is the position of the Mudawwana. The \naccepted position is that of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) because the female is generally desirable.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Four: On Fasting \n \n \nThis also deals with things connected to it like the Tarawih \nprayer. Linguistically \"Siyam\" means to restrain and abandon. \nWhoever forgoes something is said to be fasting. Allah azza wa jall \nsays in the story about Maryam (alaiha salam), \"I have vowed a \nfast to the All-Merciful,\" (Holy Qur‟an 19:26) meaning a silence, \nwhich is withholding from words. In the Shari‟ah, it is to restrain \nthe appetites of the stomach and genitals from dawn to sunset \nwith an intention before or at dawn except in days of \nmenstruation, lochia and the „Ids. Fasting is divided into the \nobligatory and non-obligatory.  \n \nShaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi): tobacco is also avoided in the \nfast.  \n \n23.1 Its Ruling  \n \nFasting the month of Ramadan is obligatory \n  \nIt is obligatory by the Book, the Sunnah and consensus. Whoever \ndenies that it is obligatory to fast Ramadan is an unbeliever by \nagreement. Whoever affirms its obligation and refuses to fast it is \na rebel and is compelled to do it.  \n \nIt is affirmed that the fast of Ramadan begins by one of two \nthings, either by the month of Sha'ban lasting 30 days or by \nsighting the new moon.  \n \n23.2 Beginning the Fast  \n \n23.2a When the fast begins  \n \nYou start fasting when the new moon is sighted and you \nstop fasting when the new moon is sighted, whether this is \nafter thirty or twenty-nine days. If the new moon cannot be \nseen because of clouds you count thirty days from the \nbeginning of the preceding month and then begin fasting. \nThe same applies to ending the fast \n  \nHis literal words are whether the sighting is exhaustive, when a \ngroup sight it so that its impossible to accuse them of lying \nbecause their report gives information, or with two witnesses of \ngood character only, with clouds or clear skies, meaning there is \nno difference between the large and small town. Similar to the two \nwitnesses of good character is one whose report is trusted, even if \na slave or a woman, when the place does not pay attention to the \nbusiness of the new moon in respect of the people of the seer and \nothers. If the place is concerned with the business of the new \nmoon, the seeing of one does not affirm it, even for his family, and \neven if they believe him, but he must present his business to the \nruler. It is not permitted for him to break the fast. If he breaks it, \nhe disbelieves, even if by interpretation because the interpretation \nis unlikely. The fast is also broken by seeing the moon of \nShawwal. If there are clouds, then you count from the beginning of \nthe month of Sha'ban. The basis for this is what is in the two \nSahih collections that he (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Fast when \nyou see it and break the fast when you see it. If it is cloudy, then \ncomplete the number.\"  \n \nThere are seven preconditions for the fast.  \n \n23.2b 1. The intention  \n \nYou should make an intention to fast the whole month at \nthe beginning of the month and it is not necessary to make \na new intention every night for the rest of the month \n  \nHe should formulate the intention with his heart the first night of \nRamadan after sunset and before dawn or at dawn as an act of \nnearness to Allah azza wa jall by performing what is obliged of \nhim during the day of refraining from eating, drinking and \nintercourse. It is not an obligation to make the intention on the \nrest of the days. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nintention must be made at night, and that is stated by Imam ash-\nShafi‟i(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), because the days of the month are individual acts of \nworship separate from one another. The invalidation of one does \nnot invalidate another, and they are not impaired by what is \ncontrary to them at night, like eating, drinking and intercourse. \nSo the days become like the five prayers during the day. It is \nobliged to give day an intention for the fast as it is obligatory to \nhave an intention for every prayer. The evidence of the Maliki \nSchool is the words of the Almighty, \"So every one of you who is \npresent (at his home) during that month should spend it in \nfasting..\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:185) This command is transferred to one \nfast, which is the fast of the month. The intention is made in the \nnight based on what the authors of the Sunan reported of the \nwords of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam): \"Whoever does \nnot intend the fast before dawn has no fast.\" Advancing it is \noverlooked in the fast because of the difficulty. Shaikh ibn Naji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The literal words of the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is not obliged for someone who \nbreaks the fast, like the menstruating women, to renew the \nintention. That is the case according to Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. There remain the sick person \nand traveler when they continue to fast. They are obliged to make \nthe intention every night because it is not obligatory for them to \ncontinue. When the sick person becomes well and the traveler \narrives, the intention for what remains is enough for them, like \nthe menstruating woman who becomes pure, the child who \nreaches puberty in the fast, and the kafir who becomes a Muslim \nduring the month.  \n \nThe other preconditions are:  \n \n Islam. \n \n Sanity. \n \n Being free of menstruation and lochia.  \n \n Refraining from things that break the fast. \n \nThe ability to fast. \n \nAdulthood.  \n \n23.2c Duration of the fast  \n \nYou fast until night comes  \n \nBased on the ayat and because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said in the Sahih, \"When night advances from there and \nthe day retreats from here and the sun sets, the faster breaks the \nfast.\"  \n \nand it is Sunnah to break the fast as soon as possible  \n \nWhen you are certain the night has come. There is disagreement \nabout continuing after sunset. Some say that it is unlawful as it is \nunlawful on the Day of the „Id. Some say it is permitted and he \nhas the reward of the faster. The fiqh of the question that he has \nthe reward of the faster is weak. The statement that it is unlawful \nis more likely unless his intention is that it is obliged for him. \nOtherwise, it is disliked when it is without necessity.  \n \n23.2d Delaying Sahur  \n \nand to delay your Sahur. If you are not sure if the time of \nFajr has come or not you should not eat \n  \nSahur means what is eaten and Sahur is the act of eating. The \namount of the best delay after finishing eating and drinking there \nremains until Fajr the amount of time it takes to recite 50 ayats. \nThe basis for this is the words of the  Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam), \"My community will continue to be all right as long as \nthey hurry to break the fast and delay the Sahur.\" (Imam Ahmad \n[RA]) If he is unsure of the time of Fajr, he should not eat or drink \nor have intercourse. This can mean prohibition or dislike. The \nwell-known position is that it is a prohibition. If he is unsure \nabout sunset, it is unlawful to eat and otherwise break the fast by \nagreement.  \n \n23.2e Not fasting the Day of Doubt  \n \nYou do not fast the 'day of doubt', fasting on the grounds \nthat it might be part of Ramadan \n  \nThis prohibition is one of dislike according to the probable text of \nthe Mudawwana. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"What is probable is that it is a prohibition based on what \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in a hasan sahih \nhadith: Shaikh Ammar ibn Yasir (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"Whoever fasts the Day of Doubt, has rebelled against Abu'l-\nQasim (the Holy Prophet) (alaihi salat wa salam).\"  \n \nWe consider the Day of Doubt which is forbidden to fast to be the \nday when it was cloudy on the night of the 29th and vision was not \nestablished, and so the morning of that night is the Day of Doubt.  \n \n23.2f Its judgment when it is fasted  \n \nIf you do this it is not counted even if it turns out to have \nbeen Ramadan \n  \nIf you fast the Day of Doubt out of caution and then it is \nestablished to be Ramadan, it is not counted because the intention \nwas not firm.  \n \nIf you want to fast that day as a voluntary fast, however, \nyou can do so \n  \ni.e. this is when it is his custom to fast.  \n \n23.2g When you discover it is Ramadan in the morning  \n \nIf you get up in the morning and discover, before having \neaten or drunk anything, that Ramadan has begun you \nmust fast the rest of the day but you cannot count it as one \nof the days of your Ramadan and you have to make up a \nday \n  \nIf this happens, you have to make it up by the lack of the \nintention. Nevertheless you must avoid food and drink and \nanything that would invalidate the prayer for the rest of the day. \nIt is also obligatory for him to fast if he has eaten or drunk or the \nlike. He makes it up, but there is no kaffarah since he forgot or it \nwas intentional by interpretation. If it is something else, then he \nmust do kaffarah.  \n \n23.2h When someone returns from a journey or stops \nmenstruating  \n \nIf someone returns from a journey and they are not fasting \nor if a woman finishes menstruating during the day then in \nboth these cases it is all right for them to eat and drink \nduring the remainder of that day \n  \nThis in the daytime. It is not recommended for them to refrain. It \nis the same in the case of the child who reaches maturity, the \nmadman who recovers his senses, the sick person who starts out \nnot fasting and then becomes well. It is the same for the one who \nfaints and then regains consciousness, the one compelled by the \nnecessity of hunger or thirst, and the nursing woman whose child \ndies in the day. It is the same for an unbeliever who becomes \nMuslim, although it is recommended for him to refrain which is \nnot the case with the others. As for the one who breaks his fast by \nforgetfulness or on the Day of Doubt or is forced to break it, and \ntheir excuse is removed, then it is obligatory for them to refrain. \nWhen the one forced breaks his fast after the compulsion is \nremoved, he must make it up with kaffarah unless there was a \nvalued interpretation.  \n \n23.3 The ruling on breaking a voluntary fast  \n \n23.3a Breaking it intentionally  \n \nIf you are doing a voluntary fast and break your fast \nintentionally, or if you start off on a journey and break \nyour fast because of it, you must make up that day \n  \nWithout compulsion or excuse, or because you set off on a journey \nwhile observing a voluntary fast and then break it because of it: it \nis obligatory to make it up in both cases. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that there is disagreement about when \nhe breaks it intentionally: is it recommended to fast for the rest of \nit or is that not recommended as Shaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said?   \n \n23.3b Breaking it unintentionally  \n \nIf in a voluntary fast you break your fast unintentionally \nyou do not have to make up a day but if this happens in the \nobligatory fast you have to make up a day \n  \nThere is no disagreement that it is not obligatory to make it up if \nit is unintentional, but there is a disagreement about whether it is \nrecommended and there are two positions. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) heard that it is recommended. When the \nobligatory fast is unintentionally broken, it must be made up. \nShaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The literal meaning of \nhis (alaihi salat wa salam) words is that the obligatory is in \nRamadan or elsewhere.\"  \n \n23.4 Things which break or do not break the fast  \n \n23.4a Siwak  \n \nThere is no harm in using a siwak at any time during the \nday while you are fasting  \n \nThis is stated in the Mudawwana. It means it is permissible, as \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated, \"The siwak is \npermitted every day as long as nothing splits off from it. It is \ndisliked to moisten it.\" Some of them said that it is permitted after \nmidday for the one who does not have a legal requirement. As for \na legal requirement like wudu', the prayer, recitation and dhikr, it \nis recommended. That is correct as the hadith shows in the words \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"If it were not that it \nwould be hard on my community, I would command them to use \nthe siwak for every prayer.\" So this includes the person who is \nfasting.  \n \nWhen he says, \"during the day while you are fasting\" that alludes \nto the words of Imam ash-Shafi‟i(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam \nAhmad ibn Hanbal (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is preferred before \nmidday and disliked after it based on what is in the Sahih where \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  said, 'The odor of the \nmouth of the faster is sweeter with Allah than the scent of musk.\" \nThat is because of Allah azza wa jall's pleasure with him and His \npraise for the faster.  \n \n23.4b Blood-letting  \n \nand blood-letting is not disliked except if doing it will \ncause over-exhaustion \n  \ni.e. illness. In the dictionary, it means to expose oneself to death. \nTherefore cupping is only disliked when illness is feared because \nhe is unsure about health and its absence. If he knows it is safe, \nthere is no dislike.  \n \n23.4c Vomiting  \n \nIf you vomit involuntarily while fasting in Ramadan you do \nnot have to make up a day  \n \nIf it is in Ramadan or another day, there is no obligation or \nrecommendation to make it up, whether it is for a reason or \nsimply on account of fullness, and whether the food has been \naltered or not. This is when he knows that none of it went back to \nhis stomach after reaching his mouth. If he knows that some of it \nwent back after it reached his mouth, then he must make it up \nwhen it is unintentional. Otherwise he owes kaffarah. He must \nalso make it up if he is unsure about that. Undigested food is like \nvomit. It is what emerges from the mouth of the intestines when \nthey are full. As for phlegm which reaches the end of the tongue \nand he swallows it deliberately, there is no making up. It is the \nsame with spit which he collects in his month and then swallows. \nHe does not have to make anything up.  \n \n23.4d Swallowing vomit  \n \nbut if you make yourself vomit you have to make up a day \n  \nThere are two statements about whether this is obligatory or \nrecommended. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that \nthe first is well-known, and it is preferred. Shaikh ibn al-Jallab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) preferred the second. The literal words of \nthe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that there is no kaffarah for \nthe one who makes himself vomit in Ramadan. There is some \ndisagreement in the question about whether or not there is \nkaffarah. Shaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he \nmakes it up and does kaffarah. Shaikh ibn al-Majishun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the one who makes himself vomit \nintentionally without illness must make it up and do kaffarah. \nShaikh Abu'l-Faraj (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) had been asked about the like of it, he would \nhave obliged kaffarah. It is related from Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he just makes it up.  \n \nKnow that breaking the fast in Ramadan is obligatory in certain \ncases and permitted in some. The first category is when a woman \nmenstruates during the day: she must break the fast for the rest \nof the days.  \n \n23.5 Pregnant and nursing women  \n \n23.5a Pregnant women  \n \nIf a pregnant woman is afraid on account of the child in \nher womb she should break the fast. She does not have to \nfeed anyone in expiation. It has also been said that she \nshould feed people \n  \nIf she fears for her child or herself or that she will become ill, she \nbreaks the fast and that is obligatory. According to the well-known \nposition, she does not feed people, but simply makes it up. It is \nsaid that she should feed as related by Shaikh ibn Wahb \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). What is understood from his words is that it \nis when she does not fear, she does not break it even if the fast \nexhausts her. That is not the case. If the fast exhausts her, she \ncan choose to break it. What is derived from what Shaikh ibn \n'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says is that the pregnant woman, \nnursing woman and sick person can break the fast when fasting if \nit is difficult for them, even if they do not fear illness or its \nincrease. The healthy person cannot break the fast when it is \ndifficult. There are two statements about whether he breaks the \nfast out of fear of illness. Part of the second, which is that illness \npermits it in some cases, is when he fears increased or continuing \nillness. If he fears death or great harm, then he must break it. In \nthe fear which permits breaking the fast, the person relies on the \ndoctor's statement, or his own personal experience, or the \nexperience of someone with a constitution like him. Travel has its \npreconditions which will be discussed.  \n \n23.5b Nursing women  \n \nSimilarly, if a nursing mother fears for her child and \ncannot find a wet nurse, or if the child will not accept to be \nfed by anyone else, she can break the fast but she must \nfeed people in expiation \n  \nThis is permission if she fears for her child or herself on account of \nfasting. In such a case she must feed people. It is also said that it \nis an obligation to break the fast and feed people.  \n \n23.6 The old  \n \nIf an old man cannot fast, it is recommended for him to \nfeed people \n  \nIf he is unable to fast at any time, he is permitted to break the fast \nby the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"No self is charged beyond what \nit can bear,\"(Holy Qur‟an 2:233) and \"He has not placed any \nconstraint on you in the din.\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:78) The literal text \nof the Mudawwana is contrary to what he mentioned of the \nrecommendation to feed. He says that there is no fidya. However, \nthe Mudawwana relates that he is not obliged to feed and so that \nis not contrary to the recommendation.  \n \n23.7 Feeding people (Fidya)  \n \n23.7a Its amount  \n \nFeeding people in this context consists of giving away one \nmudd for each day which has to be made up \n  \nFeeding is done by the pregnant woman fearful for what is in her \nwomb, the nursing mother who fear for her child, and the very old \nman who cannot fast is a mudd, by the Holy Prophet's (alaihi salat \nwa salam) mudd.  \n \n23.7b Its ruling  \n \nSomeone who fails to make up missed days before the \nfollowing Ramadan should also feed a poor person for each \nday they still owe \n  \nThe ruling varies because the feeding done by an old person, as \nwas said, is recommended. The feeding of a nursing woman is \nobligatory. The literal sense of his words is that making up \nRamadan is at leisure, and it is what is indicated by the hadith of \n'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) in the Muwatta'. She (radhi‟Allahu \nanha) said, \"I used to have to make up days from Ramadan and \nnot be able to fast them until Sha'ban came because I was busy \nwith the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam).\" So it is evident that \nit permissible to delay it until Sha'ban, even if what was delayed \nbecomes immediately obligatory. That shows that the obligation is \nwide. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it should be \nimmediate, but that is weak. According to the first statement, he \nis considered to be lax in Sha'ban when he is healthy and at home, \nand so they must feed. When he owes 15 days, then residence and \nhealth are considered at the last half of Ramadan and feeding is \nobligatory if he is sound and resident. If he is ill in it or on a \njourney, there is no feeding. According to the second, laxity is \nconsidered in Shawwal according to what he owes of fasting based \non analogy with what we said about Sha'ban. If Ramadan is 30 \nand he fasts a month to make it up and it is 29, then he completes \nthe 30. It is permitted to make it up at any time in which it is \npermitted to fast voluntarily. It is not made up in days when it is \nforbidden to fast.  \n \n23.8 Children  \n \nChildren are not obliged to fast until such time as a boy \nhas his first wet dream or a girl her first menstrual period \nbecause it is when children reach physical maturity that \nall the physical acts of worship become obligatory for \nthem. Allah azza wa jall says, \"When your children reach \nphysical maturity they should seek permission (to enter).\" \n(Holy Qur’an 24:59)  \n \nOne of the preconditions for the fast is being an adult. It is neither \nobligatory nor recommended for children to fast. Maturity is by \nejaculation or age which is 18 in the well-known position. This is \ndifferent from the prayer. It is recommended to command them to \ndo it. Maturity is what brings the person from childhood to \nmanhood and sense. All acts - prayer, fasting, hajj and raiding - \nare obligatory for them, as well as actions of the heart, like the \nobligation of intentions which are obligatory because the intention \nis one of the actions of the heart, and creeds like the belief that \nAllah is One, for example. Evidence that obligations become \nincumbent children when they reach maturity is in the words of \nAllah azza wa jall. Asking permission is obliged then and is \nconnected to maturity.  \n \n23.9 Defilement’s  \n \nIf someone who has not done ghusl wakes up after Fajr in a \nstate of janaba or if the period of a woman who has been \nmenstruating finishes before Fajr and she does not do \nghusl till after Fajr, then fasting that day is valid in both \nthese cases \n  \nThis is either from intercourse or an intentional or unintentional \nwet-dream in an obligatory or voluntary fast, or a woman has her \nperiod stop and sees that she is pure before Fajr. If they do not \nhave a ghusl until after dawn, even if they are able to do, their \nfast is still allowed and they owe nothing. The validity of the fast \nof the person in janaba is that it is confirmed that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) was in janaba at Fajr in Ramadan \nand he (alaihi salat wa salam) had a ghusl and fasted. As for the \nvalidity of the menstruating woman whom becomes pure before \nFajr in Ramadan, it is agreed that that is when she is pure before \nFajr with the amount in which she could wash. According to the \nwell-known position that also applies to the amount of time in \nwhich it is not possible to wash. If she becomes pure after Fajr, \nher fast is not valid.  \n \n23.10 On Feast days  \n \n23.10a Not allowed on the ‘Id  \n \nFasting is not permitted on the day of ‘Id al-Fitr or the day \nof the ‘Id al-Adha nor should anyone fast the two days after \nthe ‘Id al-Adha unless he is doing Hajj Tamatt'a and does \nnot have an animal to sacrifice \n  \nAs it is not permitted, it is not valid since it is forbidden by the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) to fast them.  \n \n23.10b The fourth day  \n \nThere should be no voluntary fasting on the fourth day \neither but if someone has vowed to fast or has previously \nbroken off a consecutive fast, they should fast that day \n  \nThe fourth day after the Day of Sacrifice is not made a voluntary \nfast. It is fasted by someone who has fasted Shawwal and Dhu'l-\nQa'da for kaffarah for a dhihar divorce or murder and then \nbecomes ill and regains his health in the fourth night. He can fast \nit.  \n \n23.11 Making up the fast  \n \n23.11a Breaking the fast out of forgetfulness  \n \nIf you break the fast in Ramadan out of forgetfulness you \nonly have to make up that day \n  \nYou are obliged to continue to fast and to abstain through the rest \nof day of Ramadan. You are obliged to continue to fast when you \nbreak it by forgetfulness in an obligatory fast other than \nRamadan. There is no making up in the well-known position. One \nshould be careful about forgetting. When you break it \nintentionally you owe kaffarah as well as making up. That is why \nhe says \"only\" since he said he owes no kaffarah because which \ndiffers from Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nShaikh Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) who say that there is \nkaffarah if he breaks it through intercourse based on the hadith of \nthe bedouin who came to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nbeating his chest and pulling his hair, saying, \"I am destroyed! I \nam destroyed!\" The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) asked \nhim, \"What is the reason for this?\" He replied, \"I had intercourse \nwith my wife in Ramadan\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) commanded \nhim to do kaffarah. The reply to that by the Maliki masters is that \nthe circumstances of striking himself and pulling his hair indicate \nthat the intercourse was intentional.  \n \n23.11b Breaking the fast because of illness  \n \nThe same applies if you are forced to break the fast due to \nillness \n  \nWhen the fast is too difficult, or when he fears that the illness will \ncontinue longer, or increase, or healing will be delayed, he only \nhas to make it up without kaffarah. If it is an illness in which it is \nnot difficult to fast or in which increased illness or delay of health \nis not feared, and he breaks his fast, then he must make it up and \ndo kaffarah.  \n \n23.12 A Traveler  \n \n23.12a Length of journey  \n \nIf you are on a journey for which you can shorten the \nprayer you are permitted to break the fast even if there is \nno particular need to do so, making up any days missed \nlater, but according to us it is better to fast \n  \nIf you go on a journey at the time of the intention such that you \nwill reach a limit where shortening the prayers begins before \ndawn. So the distance is four or more mail stages of a return \njourney, and it should not be a journey involving disobedience of \nAllah azza wa jall. You are permitted to break it, eat, drink and \nhave intercourse. This is even if the journey is not necessary. \nThere is no disagreement that he must make up the fast by the \nwords of the Almighty, \"the prescribed number should be made up \nfrom days later,\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:184) The Malikis prefer that the \none who is strong enough should fast because the Almighty says, \n\"It is better for you if you fast.\"  \n \n23.12b A journey of less than the minimum  \n \nIf anyone travels less than four mail stages (48 miles) and \nbreaks the fast thinking it is permissible to do so, they do \nnot have to do kaffarah although they must make up the \nday. \n[Anyone \nwho \nbreaks \nthe \nfast \nthrough \nan \ninterpretation does not have to do kaffarah]  \n \nBecause he followed an interpretation. He is only obliged to make \nit up without dispute. The literal words about the one who uses \ninterpretation not owing kaffarah are unrestricted, but there is a \nwell-known disagreement. The interpretation must be a likely one. \nThere is no kaffarah because he is excused by relying on a strong \nreason. If the interpretation is unlikely, which is when its reason \nis not strong, then there is kaffarah. One of the cases in which is \nthe reason is strong is the case we mentioned about the old man, \nand the one who breaks the fast out of forgetfulness and then \nbreaks it intentionally that it is permitted: he owes no kaffarah. \nThere is also the case of the person in janaba or menstruating \nbefore dawn who only had a ghusl for that after Fajr and thought \nthat the fast for that day was not obliged and deliberately did not \nfast: he has no kaffarah. There is the case of someone who has \nSahur at Fajr and thinks that the fast for that day is not binding \nand so he breaks it after that intentionally: he owes no kaffarah. \nThere is the one who arrives after a journey at night in Ramadan \nand thinks that he does not have to fast the morning of that day \nand that one of the preconditions of the obligation of the fast is \nthat he come from the journey before sunset. and so he breaks it \ndeliberately: he owes no kaffarah.  \n \nUnlikely cases are those in which the cause is weak. If he sees the \nmoon of Ramadan and his testimony is not accepted and he thinks \nthat the fast is not binding for him and so he breaks it - he owes \nkaffarah. Part of it is the person who normally has a fever every \nthree days and so when the day he comes he breaks the fast and \nthen the fever comes to him on that day. He is obliged to do \nkaffarah, and even more so if it does not come. One is the woman \nwho normally menstruates on a particular day and so she does not \nfast that day and then she menstruates later in the day. One of \nthem is the one slanders a person in Ramadan and thinks that \nthat invalidates his fast because he ate the meat of his the flesh of \nhis brother and so he breaks it intentionally. He must do kaffarah, \nand make it up.  \n \n23.13 Kaffarah  \n \n23.13a Who owes kaffarah  \n \nKaffarah only applies to people who break the fast \ndeliberately \neither \nby \neating, \ndrinking, \nor \nsexual \nintercourse \n  \nIf he resolves to eat and drink or have intercourse, but does not do \nit, he owes nothing, either making it up or kaffarah. It is same for \nsomeone who resolves to break wudu' by breaking wind, for \ninstance, and does not do it- he does not have to do wudu'.  \n \nIn the case of intercourse, one distinguishes the deliberate from \nthe forgetful and the ignorant, i.e. the one who was ignorant of the \nprohibition and the one who did not rely on anything, like \nsomeone who is a new Muslim who believes that fasting does not \nforbid intercourse, for instance, and so does it -he owes no \nkaffarah.  \n \n23.13b Making up the day  \n \nThe actual day when the kaffarah was incurred must also \nbe made up on top of the kaffarah itself \n  \nMaking it up is obliged as well as the kaffarah.  \n \n23.13c What kaffarah consists of:  \n \nThe kaffarah on account of eating, drinking, or intercourse \ndeliberately in Ramadan by abuse or unlikely interpretation is one \nof three things from which one can choose.  \n \n23.13d 1. Feeding sixty people  \n \nThe kaffarah for breaking the fast consists of feeding sixty \npoor people with one mudd for each person using the \nmudd of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). This is the \npreferred way of doing kaffarah according to us.  \n \nIt is taken from the normal food of the one who expiates or from \nthe dominant food of the people: there is disagreement on that. \nShaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said: \"That proceeds \naccording to the disagreement about kaffarah,\" i.e. the kaffarah of \nthe oath, and the zakat al-fitr. The preferred position is that it is \nthe food of the people of the land. It is understood from in his \nwords about 'sixty', as in the Mudawwana, that it is not satisfied \nby giving 30 poor people two mudds each. If he gives to less than \nsixty, he takes back from each of them what is more than a mudd \nif it is in his possession and completes the sixty. If that has been \nconsumed, he cannot take it back because he is the one who gave \nthem power over that. What is meant by the poor person here is \nnot what is meant by it in zakat, i.e. the one who does not have \nanything. What is meant is the one in need of it and the poor \nperson who does not have food for that year. There disagreement \nabout which of the three types is best. The well-known position is \nthat it is feeding and that is what is stated here. It is preferred by \nsome of the people of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) because it \nhas more benefit.  \n \n23.13e 2. Freeing a slave  \n \nHowever, it is also possible to carry out kaffarah by freeing \na slave  \n \nThe second is freeing a slave. It is a precondition that it be a \nbeliever free of defects - like blind, dumb, or mad.  \n \n23.13f 3. Fasting two months  \n \nor fasting for two consecutive months \n  \nThe third is to fast for two consecutive months. Kaffarah is \ncounted by the days.  \n \n23.13g Eating while making up  \n \nSomeone who breaks the fast deliberately while making up \na day of Ramadan does not have to do kaffarah  \n \nThis is because kaffarah is one of the special things of Ramadan, \nand there is no disagreement in what we mentioned according to \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi). The disagreement is \nwhether one or two days are made up. It is preferable that he \nmakes it two, as Shaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \nNOTE: Making up Ramadan is valid on separate or consecutive \ndays, but doing it consecutively is better.  \n \n23.14 Unconsciousness  \n \n23.14a When someone regains consciousness after Fajr  \n \nIf someone becomes unconscious during the night and \nrecovers consciousness after Fajr he should make up a day \n  \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said he is not commanded \nto refrain from eating for the rest of the day. Loss of consciousness \nis the removal of sense by an illness which afflicts him, as stated \nin at-Tahqiq. That which he relied on is the commentator of \nKhalil. The relied-on position is that if he is unconscious for all or \nmost of the day, he must make it up, whether he is sound at the \nbeginning of it or not. If he is unconscious for less than half of it, \nand is sound in the beginning of it, it is allowed. Otherwise it is \nnot. We said 'sound at the beginning,' meaning conscious at the \ntime of the intention, even if it he was unconscious before it and \nrecovers before Fajr for the amount of time in which he could do it, \neven he did not, according to the relied on position. This is when \nhe made the intention in the night before it so that it is included \nin the intention for the month. Otherwise it is not, because there \nmust be an intention since it is not valid without the intention. \nThe one intoxicated by something lawful is like the unconscious \nperson in the details mentioned, but the one who becomes \nintoxicated by something unlawful at night and remains drunk \nmust make it up. If a sleeper makes the intention at the beginning \nof the month and then sleeps for the entire mouth, his fast is valid \nand he is free of responsibility.  \n \n23.14b Prayers which must be made up  \n \nHe only has to make up a missed prayer if he comes to \nduring the time it is due \n  \nIf he fainted at night and wakes up after dawn. This was covered \nin the Chapter of Prayer. He repeats it here to point out that the \nfast is different from the prayer. The menstruating woman makes \nup the fast but no the prayer because of the difficulty of repeating \nit.  \n \n23.15 Other Prohibitions in the Fast  \n \n23.15a Guarding the tongue and limbs  \n \nWhen you are fasting you should guard your tongue and \nlimbs  \n \nThat is recommended, and some say it is obligatory, and there is \nno contradiction between the two positions. The one who says it is \nobligatory applies to refraining from the forbidden, and the one \nwho recommends it applies it to refraining from what is not \nforbidden, like excessive permissive speech.  \n \nHe mentions the limbs which are seven: hearing, sight, tongue, \nhands, feet, belly and genitals. The tongue is mentioned \nspecifically because it results in the greatest calamities. It is said \nthat there is not a morning but the limbs complain to the tongue, \n\"We ask you by Allah, go straight and we will be straight. If you \nare crooked, we will be crooked. 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  \nvisited Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and found him pulling his \ntongue. He said, ' What, Abu Bakr!\" He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"Leave me. It has brought about things.\" People should curtail \nwhat they say in Ramadan.  \n \n23.15b Honoring the month of Ramadan  \n \nand honor the month of Ramadan as Allah azza wa jall has \nhonored it \n  \nAllah azza wa jall says \"the month of Ramadan in which the \nQur'an was revealed.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:185) It is honored by the \nrecitation of Holy Qur'an, dhikr, fasting, praying, sadaqa, and \nother acts of worship. It is disliked to esteem it by decorations and \ndelegations and the like.  \n \n23.15c Avoidance of sexual pleasure in the day  \n \nA fasting man may not have sexual intercourse during the \ndaytime in Ramadan nor may he touch a woman or kiss \nher to gain pleasure \n  \nIntercourse is forbidden by agreement. Other things are said to be \nharam or disliked. It is possible to say that there is no \ncontradiction, and it is possible that the illicitness is applied when \nhe does not know that there is security and dislike when he knows \nit. In short, it is disliked for the old and young, male or female, to \nkiss his spouse or slavegirl while he is fasting, or to touch or dally. \nIt is the same for looking or remembering when he knows that he \nis safe from sperm and prostatic fluid. If he knows that he is not \nsafe or is unsure about it, it is unlawful. It is not unlawful for him \nin the night unless he is doing I‟tikaf or fasting for the kaffarah of \na dhihar-divorce. In such a case the day and night are the same. If \nhe does any of that while fasting and is safe, he owes nothing. If \nhe ejaculates, he must make it up and do kaffarah.  \n \n23.15d Sexual pleasure allowed at night  \n \nNone of these things, however, is haram for him during the \nnight \n  \nThis is because the Almighty says: \"Lawful to you on the night of \nthe fast is going to your wives...\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:187) Night and \nday are the same for the one doing I‟tikaf and fasting the kaffarah \nfor dhihar.  \n \n23.15e Waking up in janaba  \n \nIt does not matter if you wake up in the morning in a state \nof janaba because of having had sexual intercourse \n  \nHere he repeats this point to clarify that the fast is valid if you are \nin janaba.  \n \n23.15f Emission of madhy in Ramadan  \n \nIf you do get sexual pleasure during the daytime by \ntouching or kissing and this results in the emission of \nmadhy (prostatic fluid) you must make up that day \n  \nOr through looking or thinking, then he must make up the day for \nthe emission of madhy, whether it lasts or not. For the emission of \nmadhy for any reason, there is only making up, which is \nobligatory. If there is no madhy, there is no making up, even if \nthere is an erection. It is what Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), and Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) related from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in al-Mudawwana. It is the \npreferred position.  \n \n23.15g Emission of sperm in Ramadan  \n \nIf you do it deliberately and the result is the ejaculation of \nany (semen) you have to do the kaffarah \n \nAccording to the well-known position. He is silent about looking \nand remembering. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) say \nthat if he continues to look until he ejaculates, then he must make \nit up and do kaffarah. If he does not continue to do it, then he \nmust only make it up according to the well-known position. \nShaikh al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if he looks once \ndeliberately, he must make it up and do kaffarah. Shaikh al-Baji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is sound and gave remembering \nthe same judgment as the glance. If he continues to remember \nuntil he ejaculates, then he must make up and do kaffarah. If he \ndoes not continue to do it, then he makes it up without kaffarah.  \n \n23.15h The reward for fasting  \n \nAnyone \nwho \nfasts \nRamadan \nwith \nbelief \nand \nwith \nawareness of the reward for doing it is forgiven all his \nprevious wrong actions \n  \nHe believes in the reward if he fasts with the awareness that its \nreward has been stored up for him by Allah azza wa jall in the \nNext World and he does not fast in order to show off or for \nreputation. The wrong actions forbidden are the minor ones \nbetween him and his Lord. Major wrong actions are only expiated \nby repentance or Allah azza wa jall's forgiveness.   \n \n23.16 The Tarawih Prayer  \n \n23.16a The reward for praying at night  \n \nIf you stand up in prayer during the night, to the extent \nthat you able to do so, you can expect great good from it \nand pardon for your wrong actions \n  \nThe reward for standing in prayer is not limited to all the night, \nbut is obtained by anyone who stands for part of it according to his \nstate without limit.  \n \n23.16b Tarawih prayers are performed with an Imam in a \ngroup  \n \nThese night prayers are done with an Imam in masjids \nwhere the prayer is normally done in jama'a \n  \nIt is permitted to do these prayers in the masjid in groups with an \nImam. This is an exception from the dislike of praying the nafila \nin group which is indicated by the words of Shaikh Khalil \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), added to the dislike of gathering for nafila \nor in a known place since the action to gather for them continued \nfrom the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu). Part of \nhis (alaihi salat wa salam) sunan is to do this and the time they \nare done is after 'Isha'.  \n \n23.16c They can be done at home  \n \nIf you want to you can do these night prayers at home. \nIndeed this is considered better if your intention is strong \nenough for you to do them by yourself \n  \nIt is considered better to do them at home on you own if you are \nnot too lazy.  \n \n23.16d How the Salaf first did them  \n \nThe righteous people of the first community used to do \nthese prayers in the masjid. They did twenty rak’ats \nfollowed by three rak’ats - two for shaf'i and one for witr \nwith a salam in between \n  \nThese are the Companions, peace be upon all of them. They did \nthem in the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu) in \nthe masjid with 20 rak'ats. That is preferred by a group, including, \nImam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi), Imam ash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi), and \nthe action now does that followed by the shaf'i and witr. Imam \nAbu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that there is no salam \nbetween the two, and Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat there is a choice.  \n \n23.16e The later practice of the Salaf  \n \nLater they began praying thirty-six rak’ats not including \nthe shaf'i and witr. Both of these are acceptable  \n \nThen the Salaf other than the first Salaf, namely the Tabi'un, \nincreased it. 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ncommanded them to do that since it contained benefit because \nthey were making the recitation long which caused boredom and \nweariness, and so he commanded them to shorten the recitation \nand increase the rak'ats. That which 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did was preferred by Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) in the Mudawwana.  \n \n23.16f Done in groups of two rak'ats  \n \nYou say the salam after each two rak’ats. 'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu anha), said that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam), never did more than twelve rak’ats followed by a \nsingle rak’at of witr, either in Ramadan or out of it \n  \nThen he explains how the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) did \nthem according to 'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) which differs from \nwhat is in the Muwatta' where she says that he did not exceed \ntwelve at any time, Ramadan or not. It also differs from what is \nrelated from her that he prayed 15 and 17. Other things are \nrelated from his (alaihi salat wa salam) wives and they can be \ncombined if the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) first prayed \ntwo to greet the masjid and then stood to do tahajjud with two \nquick rakat‟s to start. When he left for the Subh prayer he prayed \nthe two rak'ats of Fajr. So they can be added together.  \n \n1.  Sahur is the meal eaten before Fajr prior to a day's fasting.  \n \n2. Thirtieth of Sha'ban if the new moon has not been seen the \nprevious night.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Four: On I’tikaf \n \n \nThis comes after fasting because it is prescribed as a result of \nfasting. He begins with its ruling:  \n \n24.1 Its Ruling  \n \nI’tikaf is a meritorious voluntary act. It derives from a \nword meaning 'to stay in one place' \n  \nIt is best done in the last ten days of Ramadan since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. Linguistically it means \ndevotion to a thing and sticking to it. In the Shari‟ah, it means \nthat the Muslim clings to the masjid for dhikr, the prayer, \nrecitation of the Holy Qur'an while fasting and refraining from \nintercourse and things which lead to it for a day or more with an \nintention. This definition includes its pillars which are: Islam, \ndiscrimination and being in a masjid, and what was mentioned of \ndhikr, prayer, etc., and refraining from intercourse and things \nleading up to it. Its pillars designate that on which the reality of \nthe thing is based. It is an act of devotion with those \nqualifications.  \n \n24.2 Preconditions  \n \n24.2a Fasting  \n \nYou can only do itikaf if you are fasting  \n \nIn the well-known position. It is not valid for someone who is not \nfasting, even on account of a valid excuse, as opposed to the one \nwho says that the I‟tikaf of the old man who cannot fast is valid \nand the physically weak and that fasting is not a precondition of \nitikaf in the school. Another precondition is:  \n \n24.2b Consecutive  \n \nand if it is consecutive and  \n \nAs long as he has not vowed it separately. If he does vow that, \nthen consecutiveness is not obliged.  \n \n24.2c In a masjid  \n \nin a masjid, as in the words of Allah azza wa jall, 'While you \nare doing I’tikaf in masjids'  \n \nIt is not valid in houses, shops and other such places. I‟tikaf is \nvalid in any masjid, even if there are only three masjids in a town.  \n \n24.3 Concerning the masjid  \n \nIf the town is one where there is a Jumu'a, then itikaf must be \ndone in the jama'a masjid, unless you are fulfilling a vow to do a \ncertain number of days in i‟tikaf and these do not include the day \nof Jumu'a.  \n \nIf there is a Jumu'a and he is someone who is obliged to go to \nJumu'a and vows some days of which Jumu'a is one. So it must be \nin the Jama'a masjid in which Jumu'a is sound. It is not valid on \nthe roof of the masjid nor in an adjoining house or washing place, \nnor in a storehouse since they enclose him and so resemble shops.  \n \n  \n24.4 Its length  \n \n24.4a The best length  \n \nAccording to us it best to do at least ten days \n  \nIn the Maliki school at least ten are recommended. Its most \ncomplete form is a month and it is disliked to do more. There is an \nopinion that its minimum is a day and a night and most complete \nis ten days and more than that is disliked, or different to what is \nbest.  \n \n24.4b Other lengths  \n \nHowever, if someone makes a vow to do I’tikaf for one day \nor more, they must fulfill their vow. If the vow was just for \none night, they must do I’tikaf for a day and a night \n  \nThe literal meaning would be that if he vowed a day, the night is \nnot necessary. That is not the case. The school of the Mudawwana \nis different. If he vows a day, a day and a night is obliged. If you \nsaid this is unclear since how can he be obliged with what is \ndisliked because the Mudawwana makes it clear that it is disliked \nfor less than ten days according to the position that the minimum \nof what is recommended is ten days, the answer is that he is \nspeaking about what he vows. It is obliged it even if it is disliked. \nShaikh al-Ujhuri (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned it. The well-\nknown position is that he must do a day and a night if he vows a \nnight. Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) says it is invalid \nbecause if someone vows I‟tikaf in the night without the \nprecondition, it is not valid.  \n \n24.5 Breaking the fast while in I’tikaf  \n \n24.5a. Deliberately  \n \nIf someone in I’tikaf deliberately breaks their fast, they \nhave to begin their I’tikaf all over again  \n \nThis is by eating or drinking. There is a difference between what \nis deliberate or forgetful as stated in the Mudawwana. Illness and \nmenstruation are in the same category as forgetfulness. So when \nhe eats out of forgetfulness or becomes ill or a woman \nmenstruates, they do not have to begin again since it is not \ninvalidated and he makes it up after the excuse which broke the \nretreat no longer exists.  \n \n24.5b Intercourse in I’tikaf  \n \nand the same applies to someone who has sexual \nintercourse while in I’tikaf whether during the day or the \nnight and whether it is through forgetfulness or deliberate \n  \nHe adds in the Mudawwana \"or kisses, has contact or touches.\" \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, \"even if there is no \npleasure.\" Shaikh Abu'l-Hasan (rahmatullahi alaihi) qualifies it \nby experiencing or intending pleasure even if he does not feel it.  \n \n24.5c Falling ill while in I’tikaf  \n \nIf you fall ill in I’tikaf you can return home but you should \ncomplete your I’tikaf when you are well again \n  \nIf the illness prevents the person from remaining in the masjid or \nfasting rather than remaining in the masjid, he must return home \nwith the illness which prevents remaining in the masjid, and is \npermitted to do so there is an impediment to fasting only. \nAccording to Shaikh ar-Rajraji (rahmatullahi alaihi) he is obliged \nto remain in the masjid. When he is healthy he returns the masjid \nand resumes the I‟tikaf, rather than making up.  \n \n24.5d Menstruating in I’tikaf  \n \nThe same applies to a woman who starts to menstruate in \nI’tikaf \n  \nOr has bleeding from childbirth. She leaves and resumes it later.  \n \n24.5e Restrictions which continue to apply  \n \nThe restrictions of I’tikaf continue to apply to both sick \npeople and women who are menstruating during the time \nthey are away from the masjid. When the woman regains \nher purity she should return immediately to the masjid \nwhether this happens by night or by day \n  \nSo they are not permitted to do outside the masjid what is \nincompatible \nwith \nI‟tikaf \nexcept \nnot \nfasting. \nWhen \nthe \nmenstruating woman becomes pure and has a ghusl, or the sick \nperson recovers, whether it be night or day, they return to the \nmasjid immediately. If they do not return at that time, they \nrestart according to the well-known position. If they return, that \nday is not counted because of the impossibility of fasting it.  \n \n24.6 Not leaving the masjid  \n \n24.6a Only to go to the lavatory  \n \nPeople doing I’tikaf should not leave the masjid except for \nnormal needs \n  \nIt is all that compels him to leave: urine, feces, the ghusl for \nJumu'a, the „Id, wudu', ghusl for janaba, eating and drinking \nprovided that he does not go beyond the near place to the further \nplace. Otherwise, his I‟tikaf is invalidated. Another precondition \nthat he does not engage in conversation with anyone. Otherwise \nhis I‟tikaf is invalidated. Then he clarifies the time in which I‟tikaf \nbegins :  \n \n24.6b When you enter the masjid  \n \nYou should enter the masjid where you are intending to do \nyour I’tikaf before sunset on the night you intend to start \n  \nThis is recommended. Compare it with what is in the two Sahih \ncollections of the hadith of 'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha). She said, \n\"When the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) wanted to do I‟tikaf, \nhe prayed Fajr and then entered into his I‟tikaf.\" The answer is \nthat he (alaihi salat wa salam) entered at the beginning of the \ntime. He isolated himself in the place in which he intended to do \nI‟tikaf after Subh. What meant by his place of I‟tikaf is the tent \n'A'isha (rahmatullahi alaihi) had set up for him, and he prayed \nSubh and then entered it.  \n \n24.7 What to avoid in I’tikaf  \n \nWhile in I’tikaf you should not visit the sick, follow funeral \nprocessions or go out to transact any business \n  \n24.7a Visiting the sick  \n \nWhile someone is in I‟tikaf, he is forbidden to visit the sick, as long \nas it is not one of his parents or both of them. In such a case, he is \nobliged to go out to show filial devotion since it is an obligation in \nthe Shari‟ah and his I‟tikaf is invalidated.  \n \n24.7b Funerals  \n \nHe is not permitted to come out for the funeral prayer of both his \nparents. If he goes out, his I‟tikaf is invalidated. He must go out to \nthe funeral prayer for one of them since not going out is \ndisobeying the living. That is not the case when they are both \ndead. His I‟tikaf is invalidated. This applies to his parents, even if \nthey are unbelievers. He does not join the funeral prayer, even if it \nis placed adjacent to him, and if it is the funeral or a neighbor or \nrighteous person. But if he does visit a sick person in the masjid or \nprays in a funeral prayer in it, his I‟tikaf is not invalidated.  \n \n24.7c Business  \n \nAs for business, Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked, \n\"Do his words, \"does not go out to transact business\" mean the \nusual going out because business takes in the markets and so it is \nprohibited to trade in the masjid or outside it, or do we say that he \ndoes not go out in the usual way and so it is permitted to trade \ninside the masjid? What is preferred is the first probability which \ncoincides with what Shaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said: \n\"If he makes a contract on a sale inside the masjid, his I‟tikaf is \nnot invalidated.\" That is the case if the transaction is put in front \nof him. If he exceeds that, then his I‟tikaf is invalidated unless it \nis through a broker and so it is prohibited without dispute. If it is \nwithout a broker and it is something slight, it is permitted without \ndislike. If it is a lot, it is disliked, but it does not invalidate the \nI‟tikaf in two aspects, i.e. whether by a broker or not, as the sale is \nnot invalid without disagreement i.e. whether it is forbidden or \ndisliked. That is not imagined in the form of permission. He is \npermitted to go out for other than trade for what he cannot \ndispense with, even if he goes far outside, as long as he does not \npass a closer place where he can buy, but with the precondition \nthat he does not find anyone to sell to him.  \n \n24.7d No preconditions  \n \nYou cannot make your I’tikaf conditional in any way \n  \nIt is not permitted to stipulate a condition in it. Its literal meaning \nit is forbidden, as \"I will do I‟tikaf for ten days. If I think I should \nleave, then I will leave,\" or he says, \"I will do I‟tikaf for the days \nrather than the nights,\" or the reverse. It is like that if he makes a \nprecondition that if something occurs to him which obliges him to \nmake it up, he will have to make it up. There is no difference in \nthat between making a precondition before beginning it or \nafterwards. If any of that occurs, the precondition is invalid and \nthe I‟tikaf is valid.  \n \n24.8 Lack of impediments  \n \n24.8a The Imam can do it  \n \nThere is no harm in the Imam of a masjid doing I’tikaf \n  \nBut it is better if he leaves it, meaning it is disliked for the Imam \nof the masjid. Or he indicates someone who says that the Imam of \nthe masjid cannot do it. Shaikh ibn Waddah (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated from Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he did not \npermit the person in I‟tikaf to act as Imam of the obligatory or \nnafila prayers. It is permitted that he be the Imam of the masjid \nwith an equal balance on each side according to what Shaikh ibn \nNaji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, or it is recommended that he be \nthe regular Imam. It is relied upon. He reported the permission \nwithout \nhis \naim \nbeing \nrefutation. \nShaikh \nAbu \n'Imran \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that it is permitted. There is a text \nin the Mukhtasar that he is disliked it for the regular Imam. You \nthat it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \ndid I‟tikaf while he (alaihi salat wa salam) was the Imam. It is not \nconcealed from you that it weakens what is in the Mukhtasar and \nwhat is relied on is the recommendation which is in agreement \nwith the hadith.  \n \n24.8b Marriage  \n \nIt is permissible for someone in I’tikaf to get married and \nfor him to officiate at someone else's marriage \n  \nIt is qualified in the Mudawwana that he does it while he is in \nplace. If it is elsewhere, it is disliked if it is in the masjid and \nforbidden if it is outside of the masjid and then his I‟tikaf is \ninvalidated. It is also qualified by it not taking up a lot of his time. \nOtherwise it is disliked, whether he is the husband or the \nguardian. If it is said that the one in ihram is forbidden to \ncontract a marriage, so what is the difference between him and \nthe one in I‟tikaf since they are both involved in a form of worship \nin which intercourse is forbidden, there are various answers, one \nof which is that the basic position is the permissibility of marriage \nfor everyone. The person in ihram is removed from this by the \nstatement of the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) that the \nperson in ihram does not marry or give in marriage. The rest \nremands on its original basis which is permissibility.  \n \n24.9 Leaving I’tikaf  \n \n24.9a When he leaves outside of Ramadan  \n \nIf you go into I’tikaf at the beginning of the month or in the \nmiddle of the month, when you leave from your I’tikaf you \nshould do so after the Maghrib of its last day \n  \nThis is any month outside of Ramadan. He is permitted to leave \nhis I‟tikaf after Maghrib without dispute in the school. This is \noutside of Ramadan.  \n \n24.9b When he leaves in Ramadan  \n \nHowever, if the period of your I’tikaf continues until the \nday of the ‘Id al-Fitr then you should spend the night \nbefore the ‘Id in the masjid and leave from it in the \nmorning to go to the place where the ‘Id prayer is going to \nbe held \n  \nIf his I‟tikaf is in Ramadan, then the end is sunset on the day of \nthe „Id al-Fitr and so he is recommended to spend that night in the \nmasjid until morning and go to the place of prayer since that is \nwhat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did, i.e. he connects \none act of worship to another.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Five: On the zakat of money, \ncrops, livestock and what comes out of mines; \njizya and what should be taken from Dhimmî \nmerchants and merchants who come from the \nDar al-Harb \n \n \nIn this chapter he also mentions mines and the zakat on \nmerchandise. Linguistically zakat means growth and increase and \nit is used for the increase in crops and property. In the Shari‟ah it \nis a term used to designate the amount of money or goods taken \nfrom specific property when it reaches a specific amount at a \nspecific time which must be spent in specific categories with \nspecific ways. It is called zakat because the one who gives it grows \nby doing it with Allah azza wa jall, i.e. his rank with Him is raised \nby that. It is attested to by the words of the Almighty, \"Take \nsadaqa from their wealth to purify and cleanse them\" (Holy \nQur‟an 9:103)  \n \n25.1 Its Ruling  \n \nIt is obligatory to pay zakat on money, crops and livestock \n  \nMoney consists gold and silver and is mentioned in respect to the \ntradition. What is mentioned of gold and silver is called \"specie\" \n('ayn) by its honor. Crops consists of food groups used for life in \ngeneral. Livestock refers to camels, cattle, and sheep and goats.  \n \nZakat became an obligation in the second year of Hijra. The \nevidence for its obligatory nature is the Book, sunnah and \nconsensus. Whoever disputes its obligatory nature is an \nunbeliever. If someone affirms that it is obligatory but refuses to \npay it, he is beaten and it is taken from him by force and that is \nenough: he is not an unbeliever. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says he is an unbeliever, but this is unlikely. There are \npreconditions for the obligation and preconditions for the validity. \nAs for the first, they are seven in general because Islam is one of \nthe preconditions of the obligation since the unbelievers are not \nresponsible for the rulings of the Shari‟ah. The soundest position \nis that they are addressed to them, and so Islam is a precondition \nfor its validity.  \n \n25.2 Its preconditions  \n \nThe preconditions of the obligation are:  \n \nIslam,  \n \nFreedom,  \n \nThe nisab,  \n \nOwnership,  \n \nA year for other than treasure-trove and tenths,  \n \nLack of debt in money,  \n \nThe coming of the collector to the herds if there are collectors and \nthey can reach them.  \n \nThe preconditions for its validity are four:  \n \nIntention,  \n \nIts distribution in the place of its obligation,  \n \nPaying it after it is becomes obligatory,  \n \nPaying it to a just Imam to take it and spend it if he exists or to its \npeople, who are the eight classes indicated by the words which are \nindicated by the words of the Almighty: \"Sadaqa are for the poor \nand the needy\" (Holy Qur‟an 9:60)  \n \n25.3 The time of the obligation  \n \n25.3a On crops  \n \nZakat on crops must be paid on the day they are harvested \n  \nThere are two statements about grains and three about fruits. The \nfirst is by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) who says that when \nthe palms are appraised, the grapes are good, the olives are black \nor near to it, the crop was begun to ripen and does not need water, \nthen zakat is due on it . Shaikh ibn 'Abd as-Salam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that it is the well-known position. The second is by \nShaikh ibn Maslama (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is only obliged \non crops when they are harvested and only obliged on dates when \nthey are cut. His evidence is the words of the Almighty, \"Render \nthe dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 6:141) This is the meaning \"harvest and cutting\". \nThe third is particular to dates which is that they are only obliged \nby estimation, which is made by Shaikh al-Mughira (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). There is an order to these things: first soundness, then \nestimation and then cutting; and ripening is first and then \nharvest.  \n \n25.3b On money and livestock  \n \nZakat on money and livestock is paid once a year \n  \nMoney is other than mines and treasure-trove. Zakat is obliged on \nmoney and livestock once a year, after the end of a full year. \nShaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The precondition of \nlivestock after a year is that the collector comes in the well-known \nposition if he exists and arrives. Otherwise it is obliged after the \nyear by agreement. According to the well-known position, if it is \npaid before he comes, then it does not satisfy the requirement.  \n \n25.4 On farm produce  \n \n25.4a The minimum amount  \n \nNo zakat is due on any amount of dates or grain less than \nfive wasqs \n  \nSince it is sound that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"No zakat is due on grain or fruit until it reaches five wasqs.\" \n(Sahih Muslim) Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"See whether legumes are included with grain, raisins and olives \nwith fruits or not. Some commentaries include it in grain and \nmake grain include other things than fruits. There are 19 types: \nwheat, barley, sult-barley, rice, millet, sorghum, and Arabian \nwheat, and seven legumes: lentils, beans, broad beans, chick-peas, \nlupines, peas, grass peas, and oil seeds, which are the seeds of red \nradishes, sesame designated as sesame and cartham (safflower), \nand olives and raisins. So there are twenty types of fruits. No \nzakat is obliged on others like cotton seeds or rape and the like.  \n \nThey mentioned two rules for the five wasqs: one is by measure \nand the other by weight.  \n \n25.4b What the measure of the wasq is  \n \nFive wasqs is the same as six and a fourth qafizes. (609.84 \nkg.) One wasq is sixty sa'as measuring by the sa'a of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). One sa'a is four mudds \n  \nWasq linguistically is joining one thing to another. The Almighty \nsays, \"and the night and all it shrouds (wasaqa),\" (Holy Qur‟an \n84:17) i.e. joins and gathers the darkness and the stars. It is 60 \nsa's by the sa' of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). So he \nstates that the nisab in the year is 747 mudds with the mudd of \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Then he goes on to \nexplain the categories which are joined together and when they \nform the nisab, there is zakat due, and the types which are not \njoined since not all of the categories are combined to reach the \nnisab.  \n \n25.4c The case of certain grains  \n \nWheat, barley and sult barley are considered as one category for \nzakat purposes  \n \nWheat, barley and sult barley are combined as a single category of \ngrain as is stated in the School. They are also a single category in \nsales according to the well-known position and so disparity in \nselling one for the other is forbidden. They are combined when \nthey are cultivated and harvested in the same year. When they \nare cultivated in two or more years, it is said that one considers \nwhat is grown at the same time and they are added to each \nanother, and what is grown at one time is not added to what is \ngrown at another time. It is said that what is considered is the \ncrop. If he plants the second before harvesting the first, it is added \nto it. Otherwise it is not. The first is from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) in the book of Shaikh ibn Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and the second by Shaikh ibn Maslama \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n25.4d When zakat is due on them  \n \nso that if together they add up to five wasqs you have to \npay zakat on them \n  \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that he pays from \neach grain what is representative of it and so he pays the highest \nfrom the highest, the lowest from the lowest, and the middle from \nthe middle. If he chooses to pay the highest grain for the lowest, \nthat is allowed. If he pays the lowest for the highest, that is not \nallowed. So there is agreement regarding grains that he pays from \nevery type what is representative of it. There is agreement \nregarding animals that he pays the middle. There is disagreement \nabout dates: it is said that they are like livestock, and it is said \nlike grains.  \n \n25.4e Pulses are combined  \n \nIn the same way different kinds of pulses are added \ntogether  \n \nThe Maliki School considers that pulses are considered as a single \ncategory for zakat, but not for selling. Pulses includes various \ntypes: peas, chickpeas, lentils, grass peas, broad beans, lupines, \nbeans and sesame seeds. The commentator on the Muwatta' said \nthat radish seeds are included with them.  \n \n25.4f Dates and raisins  \n \nand this also applies to different varieties of dates and \nraisins \n  \nThe same is for dates and raisins when they reach five wasqs.  \n \n25.4g Rice, sorghum and millet are different categories  \n \nHowever rice, sorghum and millet are each considered to \nbe in a different category and are not added together when \ncalculating zakat \n  \nEach of these are a separate category and according to the School \nthey are not added together because they are clearly separate and \ntheir form differs. He says this is in reference to zakat to indicate \nthe person who says that they are all one category in usury, i.e. \ndisparity is not allowed between them. That is the position of \nShaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi). The well-known position \ndiffers from that.  \n \n25.4h What is done with the various types of dates  \n \nIf there are various types of dates in a date-garden you use the \nmiddle quality when paying zakat.  \n \nSo they are good, middle and poor. In the well-known position, the \nmiddle variety are used. If there is one type, it is taken from it, be \nit is good or poor. He does not have to bring the middle or the best \nof it. If there is both excellent and poor, he takes each from its \nshare, even if the poor is few, because the basis is that zakat is \ntaken from its source by the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam): \"The zakat of every property is from it.\" The \nSunnah is makes certain requirements in livestock. So the \nSunnah is that it is paid from the generality of livestock because it \nis taken from the middle and the rest remains on its root.  \n \n25.4i Olives  \n \nYou pay zakat on olives when the amount of them reaches \nfive wasqs, paying the zakat in oil \n  \ni.e. measured in dry ones. Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays that there is no zakat on them nor in anything which has oil. \nThe sound position in the basis of the School, i.e. sound and \ncurrent according to the rule of the School is that that which is not \na foodstuff has no zakat paid on it. We read in at-Tahqiq, \"Even it \nis not a comestible, it is included in it if it is sound for food.\" \nAccording to the statement that there is zakat, its zakat is given \nfrom its oil, not from its grain in the well-known position. There is \nno precondition that oil reach the nisab in weight. The \nprecondition is the grain reaching the nisab, as was clearly stated \nby the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported the agreement on that. If it is paid \nfrom its grain, that is not allowed.]  \n \n25.4j Zakatable seeds  \n \nYou also pay zakat on sesame seeds and radish seed in oil for \nthem. If you sell this produce, it is possible to pay the zakat owed \nusing the money you have received, if Allah azza wa jall wills.  \n \nAnd other things which are pressed for oil when that reaches the \nnisab. if the olives are sold, then it is paid from the price whether \nthe price reaches the nisab or not. The nisab of the grain itself is \nonly considered, not the price. One of them said that he said, \"If \nAllah wills\" because of the weakness of this position, and some say \nthat it is because of the strength of the disagreement regarding it. \nThat which is in the Mukhtasar and its commentary is that if \nolives and their like have oil, it is paid from their oil. If they have \nno oil, like olives of Egypt, it is paid from their price. It is like that \nwith what is it not dried, like the fresh dates and grapes of Egypt \nand green broad beans. Zakat is paid from their price, even if they \nare sold for a lot less than that on which zakat is obliged if it is \nestimated to be five wasqs. If it is less than that, nothing is \nobliged on it, even if he sells it for many times more than what \nwould incur zakat.  \n \n25.4.k Fruit and vegetables  \n \nYou do not pay zakat on fruit and vegetables \n  \nLike apples and apricots, nor vegetables based on what is reported \nby Mu'adh ibn Jabal (radhi‟Allahu anhu): the Rasulullah (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"\"There is a tenth ('ushr) on land watered by \nthe sky or springs or running springs. There is half an 'ushr (5%) \non land which is irrigated,\" i.e. that which is transported from a \nriver or well to water crops by some device. That is about dates, \nwheat and grains. As for cucumbers and watermelons, they are \nexempt as the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) exempted them.  \n \n25.6 On Money  \n \n25.6a The nisab on gold  \n \nThere is no zakat on gold if you have less than twenty \ndinars. If the amount reaches twenty dinars you pay one \nhalf of a dinar, in other words, one-fortieth of the total \namount. Any more than that is calculated on the same \nbasis, however small the additional amount is \n  \n \n25.6b The nisab on silver  \n \nThere is no zakat on silver if you have less than two \nhundred dirhams, which is five uqiyyas - one uqiyya being \nforty dirhams. This is based on seven dinars being of the \nsame weight as ten dirhams. If you have two hundred such \ndirhams you pay one-fortieth, that is five dirhams. \nAnything more than that is calculated on the same basis  \n \n \nBy the legal dirham, which is the Makkan dirham. Its weight is \n555 grains of middle barley corns. Each dinar weighs 72 grains. It \nis said that it is the dirham of measure because by the legal \nmeasures.  \n \n25.6c Gold and silver are a single category  \n \nGold and silver and considered as one category for the \npurposes of zakat. So if, for example, someone has one \nhundred dirhams and ten dinars they should pay one-\nfortieth of each \n  \nSince that is what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did in \nthat. It is clarified in at-Tahqiq: \"It is related that Shaikh Bukayr \nibn 'Abdullah ibn al-Ashajj (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, 'The \nSunnah is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) joined \ngold to silver and silver to gold and took zakat from them.\" He \ngoes into a sub-category of that. The joining is by parts and not by \nvalue. The opposite would be to make each dinar equal to ten \ndirhams, even if its value is many times over, as when he has 100 \ndirhams and ten dinars, or 150 and 5 dinars. If he has 180 \ndirhams and 1 dinar equal to 20 dirhams, he does not pay \nanything. It is permitted to pay one of the two types for the other \naccording to the well-known position.  \n \n25.7 On Merchandise  \n \n25.7a Only on trading merchandise  \n \nThere is no zakat on goods unless they are for trading \npurposes \n  \nGoods comprises slaves, real estate, land, clothes, wheat, and all \ngrains, fruits and animals when they are less than the nisab. As \nfor private property, there is no zakat on it by agreement. As for \nmerchandise, there is zakat on it by agreement. As for hoarding \nwhich is what is kept from the markets for a large profit, zakat is \nobliged on it.   \n \n25.7b Preconditions  \n \nThere are preconditions for the obligation of zakat on it.  \n \n1. One of them is the intention, which is indicated by \"unless they \nare for trading purposes.\" This means he only intends them for \ncommerce, or commerce as well as private ownership, or revenue. \nHe is careful about the lack of intention so when there is an \nexchange of goods which is not intended for commerce, as when it \nis simply for ownership or just for revenue or both, then there is \nno zakat.  \n \n2. The second precondition is that he keeps the goods from the \nmarkets until a time when there is a good profit.  \n \n25.7c Sale income  \n \nIf you sell goods after one year or more from the day you \nbought them or paid zakat on their price \n  \n3. The third precondition is that he owns them by paying for them. \nThis precludes goods possessed through inheritance, gifts or the \nlike. There is no zakat on them except after a year from the day \ntheir price is received, even if he delays receiving it to avoid zakat.  \n \n4. The fourth is that he sells them for money, not that he sells \nthem at all or sells them for other than money, unless selling them \nnot for money is out of the intention to evade zakat. There is no \ndifference in selling between it being real or metaphorical in that \na person consumes the item and the merchant takes his price. \nWhat is sold must reach the nisab because stored goods are not \nevaluated as opposed to the situation where there is a constant \nturnover. So simple selling in respect of it is enough for the \nexistence of zakat, even if the price of what he sells is less than \nthe nisab because he must value the rest of his goods. This \nprecondition is taken from his words:  \n \n25.7d Length of time  \n \nthen you only have to pay one year's zakat on the proceeds \nof the goods whether these goods were in your possession \nfor one year or more than one year before you sold them \n  \nTo exclude the one who sells it for goods. He does not pay zakat.  \n \n5. The fifth precondition is that a year passes from the day the \nzakat was paid on the capital or he acquires it. He is silent about \nthe precondition, which is that the basis of those goods be money \nby which he bought them. If it is less than the nisab or was by \nbarter, even private property which he then he sells and uses to \nbuy those goods for the sake of trade. If he sells them before the \nend of the year, there is no zakat on them until the year has \npassed.  \n \nThen he moves to speaking about the merchandise which has a \nconstant turnover, which are goods which he buys for trade and \nsells without waiting not wait for a favorable market or a slack \nmarket like all owners of shops with a constant turnover. This is \nan exception to the previous statement.  \n \n25.7e The case of constant turnover  \n \nHowever, if you are a merchant with a constant turnover \nso that you never keep money or goods in your possession \nfor any length of time then you should assess your goods \nevery year and pay zakat on them and on whatever cash \nyou have in hand at that time \n  \nHe sells for current price and replaces it and does not wait for a \ngood market to sell or a slack market to buy. Then you assess your \ngoods of every category for what they are normally sold at that \ntime for a price equivalent to the common sale rather than the \nforced sale because the forced sale is at a great reduction. Brocade \nand similar cloth, like fine cotton garments, delicate cloth, and \nreal estate, are assessed in gold, and coarse garments and daily \nwear are assessed in silver. He begins the assessment, i.e. the tax \nyear, according to Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) from the \nday he begins to trade. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat it is from the day the zakat of the price is taken or from the \nday he has profit. After assessment, zakat is paid on the \nmerchandise provided some have been sold, even a dirham. There \nis no difference between selling something at the beginning or the \nend of the year. When he does not sell anything or has a sale a \nmonth after the year, for instance, he assesses it at that point, and \ntransfers his year to that month and voids the extra over the year. \nIt is like that the one who deals in money if it is with him. It is \nlike that with the zakat of his debt when it is immediately taken.  \n \n25.7f Zakat on investments  \n \nZakat is due on invested wealth when that wealth has been \nin your possession for one year \n  \nIt would literally mean whether there was a nisab or not. That is \nthe case in the well-known position. For example, he has a dinar \nwhich remains with him for 11 months. Then he buys goods with \nit which he sells after a month for 20. He pays zakat now, when he \nsells them after a month, relative or the fact that it was with him \nfor 11 months, and it becomes the second year when it is \ncompleted.  \n \nIf he enters the zakatable level in the year, he pays for the entire \nyear.  \n \n25.7g Zakat on the offspring of livestock  \n \nSimilarly zakat is due on the offspring of livestock if the \nmother animals have been in your possession for a year \n  \nThe basis for that is the statement of 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nfor them to count the lambs with their mothers but not to take \nthem. The profit is like the lambs, and lambs include the male and \nfemale young sheep and young goats at the moment which they \nare born.  \n \n25.8 Debts  \n \n25.8a Debts cancel out wealth  \n \nIf you have wealth on which zakat is due but you also have \na debt of the same amount or one which will reduce your \nwealth to less than the amount on which zakat is due then \nyou do not have to pay zakat \n  \nSo if you have 20 dirhams and owe a debt in goods, for instance, or \nfood, livestock or something else, immediate or deferred, equal to \nthe amount or one which will reduce it below the minimum on \nwhich zakat is due (as when he has 20 dirhams and owes half a \ndinar) there is no zakat in both cases. The apparent meaning of \nthe words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that the debt \ncancels zakat, even if it is the mahr of this wife who is in his care, \nand even more so if she is divorced and he owes her the mahr. It is \nthe preferred from the two well-known positions. In the other \nwell-known position, it is not canceled.  \n \nAccording to the well-known position, the debt cancels zakat, even \nthe debt of the zakat, as opposed to the debts of vows and \nexpiation‟s which do not cancel zakat. The difference is that the \ndebt of zakat is sought by the just Imam, and zakat is taken, even \nby force, which is not the case with vows and expiation‟s. Then \nthere is an exception from that generality.  \n \n25.8b If you have other assets  \n \nIf, however, you have other assets on which zakat is not \ndue such as personal effects or slaves or domestic animals \nor private property which could be used to pay off your \ndebt, then you do pay zakat on your wealth \n \nThis is when someone has wealth on which zakat is due and has a \ndebt equal to it; or one which reduces the zakatable property. If he \nhas goods like slaves, real estate, residences, garments, grains, \ndates and animals less than the nisab, or even if he has grains, \ndates or animals on which there is zakat, he puts that against the \ndebt he owes and pays zakat. Real estate means that which has no \nlintels, like open land, houses is property with a lintel like houses. \nIf the wealth on which zakat is not obliged of his personal goods is \nenough to discharge the debt, it is put opposite the debt he owes \nwith the precondition that he has had it for a year. The year of \neverything is according to it. This applies to things that can be \nsold to settle the debt.  \n \n25.8c The difference  \n \nIf your assets are not sufficient to pay your debt, then you \ncalculate the difference between the debt and your assets \nand subtract the difference from the wealth on which \nzakat is due. If there is still enough left for zakat to be due \nyou must pay the zakat \n  \nIt is assessed according to what is left. So if he has 30 dinars and \nowes 20 and has goods which could be sold for ten to settle the \ndebt and has had them for a year, ten are be taken from the 30 \nand put opposite the debt. What is meant is not actual taking and \ngiving since it is permitted to delay the term of the debt. So 20 \nremain free of the debt and zakat is paid on them.  \n \nThen he clarifies zakat which is not canceled by debt.  \n \n25.8d Debt does not affect zakat in kind  \n \nDebt does not, however, affect the obligation to pay zakat \non grain, dates or livestock \n  \nNor does it affect the zakat of mines or treasure. For instance, he \nmay have some of these things and owe a debt which would absorb \nall he has. He still must pay zakat on it and the debt does not \ncancel what is due on it. The difference between that and money is \nthat the Sunnah has come that the debt affects money. As for \nlivestock and fruits, the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nthe khalifs after him sent assessors and agents and they \nestimated for the people and took the zakat of their livestock from \nthem and did not ask whether they had a debt or not.  \n \nSimilarly the debt does not cancel Zakat al-Fitr according to \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi), and it is the preferred \nposition. According to Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) it cancels it.  \n \n25.9 If one has claim to a debt  \n \n25.9a No zakat on money owed until it is received  \n \nYou do not have to pay zakat on money which is owed to \nyou until after you have received it and if the debt has \nbeen outstanding for a number of years you only pay one \nyear's zakat on it after it is repaid \n  \nWhether it is money or goods, until he receives it, meaning the \nloan and unpaid sales when it is hoarded. An example of that is \nwhen he has some money and lends it to a man or buys goods with \nit and then sells it with a debt. It does not matter how many years \npass: the zakat of its owner is due one year after it received if it is \nthe minimum or is added to money he has and it reaches the \nminimum. It is evident he pays for just one year, even if he delays \nit to evade zakat. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat if he leaves it to evade zakat, then he pays for the past years.  \n \n25.9b The case of goods sold  \n \nThis is the same as when you own goods. You only pay \nzakat on them after you have sold them \n  \nThese are goods stored up for trade. They are the same as the debt \nsince their source is money. He pays zakat for one year even if \nthey remain for many years.  \n \n25.9c Claims which are inherited  \n \nIf the debt owing to you on the goods has been inherited by \nyou, you wait for one year after receiving payment before \npaying the zakat due \n  \nIf there is an inheritance which he does not receive for some years, \nor the goods which he sells are from inheritance, i.e. he inherited \ngoods and sells them but does not receive that price for some \nyears, or the debt is from a gift or sadaqa in the possession of the \ngiver or a bride-price in the hand of the husband or khul' which he \npays, or the fine of a tort in the hand of the perpetuator or his \nguardian, there is no zakat on it except after a year from when he \ntakes it, even if he delays it out of avoidance. If the gift remains in \nthe possession of its giver before giving and taking for two years, \nthere is no zakat on it for previous years from either the giver or \nreceiver according to Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nbecause the ownership is clear when the recipient takes it on the \nday of the sadaqa and that is why he had its proceeds from the \nday it is given.  \n \n25.10 Minors and slaves  \n \n25.10a Minors  \n \nZakat must be paid on wealth belonging to minors whether \nit is in the form of money, crops or livestock \n  \nBased on what is in the Muwatta' from Shaikh Abdu'r-Rahman \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) from his father. He said, \n\"'A'isha (radhi‟Allahu anha) used to look after me and one of my \nbrothers in her house. We were orphans. She used to pay the \nzakat from our property.\" (Al-Muwatta 17.6.13) In it 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Trade with the property of orphans and \nthen it will not be eaten away by zakat.\" (Al-Muwatta 17.6.12) The \nlike of this is not stated out of opinion. The guardian of orphans \ndoes not pay zakat for them until the matter has been presented \nto the Imam or Qadi. The gist of the fiqh of the question is that \nwhat is considered is the school of the trustee because disposal \ndepends on him and not on the school of the father of the children \nsince he is dead and the property has moved on from him, nor the \nschool of the child because he is not responsible for it. So the \ntrustee does not pay its zakat if his school is that it is canceled for \nthe child. Zakat is also paid on the property of the insane.  \n \n25.10b Zakat al-Fitr of Minors  \n \nZakat al-fitr must also be paid on their behalf \n  \n25.10c Slaves  \n \nSlaves, including those who are partially but not completely freed, \ndo not have to pay zakat on any of these categories.  \n \nSlaves of any category do not pat zakat. That applies to all the \ncategories and to zakat al-Fitr.  \n \n25.10d After slaves are free  \n \nIf they have been completely freed they do not pay zakat on any \nwealth in their possession until a whole year has passed from the \nday when they were freed. \n  \nIt is a precondition that they own it for a year: cash or livestock.  \n \n25.11 Property for personal use  \n \n25.11a No zakat on personal property  \n \nNo zakat is payable on slaves, servants, horses, your house \nnor on any private property or goods which are for your \nown personal use nor on jewelry which in regular use \n  \nThere is no zakat on such property as indicated by the hadith in \nthe two Sahih collections where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"There is no zakat owed by the Muslim on his slaves \nor horses.\" It is not due on jewelry which is worn by women even if \nit belongs to a man. From this it might be assumed that jewelry \nwhich is rented must have zakat paid on it. The evident text of the \nMudawwana is that there is no zakat, and that is the accepted \nposition. As for jewelry for the purpose of trade, there is zakat on \nit by consensus whether it belongs to a man or a woman, and its \nzakat is a year from the time when it is intended to trade in it. It \nis weighed every year and if it reaches the minimum, or he has \ngold and silver which will complete the nisab.  \n \n25.11b Inheriting that on which zakat has been paid  \n \nIf you inherit or are given any goods or take any produce, \non which zakat has already been paid, from your land and \nthen sell any of these things, no zakat is due on the \nproceeds until a year has elapsed \n  \nThe literal meaning of 'selling' is whether it is sold for money or on \ncredit, and its literal meaning is also whether or not he leaves it to \navoid zakat. 'Produce' is what is normally produced since its \njudgment is the same when it comes from land which is not his, as \nwhen he rents land and grows crops in it. So he pays zakat on it \nwhen the crop is produced, and it is like that if he did not pay \nzakat on it on.   \n \n25.12 Mines  \n \n25.12a The zakat on mines  \n \nZakat is due on gold or silver extracted from mines as soon \nas the weight of gold amounts to twenty dinars or the \nweight of silver to five uqiyyas. One-fortieth must be paid \non the day it is extracted \n  \nBy his literal words, this would apply to nuggets found without \nmining or with little work. The famous well-known is that there is \na fifth on mines and that fifth is paid to the Imam if he is just. \nOtherwise it is distributed to the poor Muslims. There is no zakat \non mined things other than gold and silver - like lead, copper, iron, \nand arsenic. This zakat is due when it reaches the minimum \nweight. One-fortieth is due on that, not a fifth by the generality of \nthe statement of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"And \nthere is no zakat on what is less than 5 awqiyyas.\" This implies \nthat when there is five awqiyyas, there is zakat on it, and that \nincludes ore. It is due the day it is extracted and the year is not a \nprecondition for it. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) means the year is not a \nprecondition and he means after it is extracted because the \nobligation is only connected to it after it is extracted. It is one of \ntwo statements. The famous one is how Shaikh al-Aqfashasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) applied the Risala as meaning after \nextraction. So the obligation is connected to its mining and not its \nextraction.  \n \n25.12b Further payment of zakat  \n \nAfter this zakat is due on all gold and silver continuously \nextracted from the same deposit, however small the \namount until such time as that deposit has been worked \ndry. If work is begun on another deposit, no zakat is due \nuntil the amount extracted reaches the amount on which \nzakat is due \n  \nThis continuity is probably in obtaining and or work or in both \ntogether, and so there are three possibilities, and he prefers the \nfirst. When he begins a new work, then there is no zakat until the \nnisab is reached as was the first case.  \n \n25.13 Jizya  \n \n25.13a Who pays jizya  \n \nJizya is taken from the men of the people of dhimma status \nprovided that they are both free and adult. It is not taken \nfrom their women, their children, or their slaves \n  \nShaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) defines it thus: what is \ntaken from the people of disbelief in repayment for their security \nand sparing their lives while they remain unbelievers. It is \nderived from jaza' (repayment) which is exchange, because they \nreceive security in exchange for the money they pay. We offer \nthem security and they offer money. It is not taken from three \ncategories: women, children and slaves because Allah azza wa jall \nhas obliged it on those who can fight, and generally that is men \nrather than women and children.  \n \n25.13b Its Preconditions  \n \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi)  implies that there are four \npreconditions for paying jizya: male, adulthood, freedom and \ndisbelief. There is also a precondition that he mix socially with the \npeople of his deen. Jizya is not taken from someone alone in a \nmonastery or hermitage. It is a precondition that the unbeliever \nremain an unbeliever. It is not taken from the apostate because he \nis not confirmed in his disbelief. Sanity and the ability to pay it \nare two preconditions. It is not taken from the madman nor from \nthe pauper who has nothing.  \n \n25.13c Magians and Christian Arabs  \n \nIt is taken from Magians and from Christian Arabs \n  \nShaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it applies to \nboth Arabs and non-Arabs. He means universality by that to \nrefute the one who opposes that.  \n \n25.13d Its amount  \n \nFor people who use gold the jizya is four dinars and for \npeople who use silver it is forty dirhams \n  \nThis applies to people conquered by force who are people of the \nunbelievers whose lands have taken by force. It is like that for the \npeople of truce who are unbelievers who protected their land by \nmaking peace in exchange for something which they paid of their \nproperty. If something particular is determined from them, it is \ntaken, be it little or a lot.  \n \n25.13e Its reduction  \n \nIt can be made less for people who are poor \n  \nIt can be lessened for the poor according to what the Imam relates. \nIf someone does not have the ability to pay something, it is \ncanceled for him. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nit is not taken from the poor and Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi)  recommended that.  \n \n25.13f Impost on trading goods  \n \nThose among them who are engaged in long-distance \ntrading should pay one tenth of what they receive when \nthey sell their goods even if they come and go several times \nin on year \n  \nMeaning the people of dhimma, men or women, free or slaves, or \nchildren. It is from a place where jizya is not paid to one where \njizya is paid. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is a \ntenth of the sale price. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid it is a tenth of what they bring, like the harbis. According to \nthe position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), if they \nwant to return before they buy or sell, it is not due from them. It is \nthe evident meaning of the words here. According to the position \nof Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi), it is obliged on them. \nThe source of the dispute is whether what is taken from them is \nconnected to benefit or to arrival in the region. It is understood \nfrom the words that the tenth is not taken from them when they \ntrade in their land, and that is the case. Then he continues about \na tenth of the price which is taken even if they come and go \nseveral times in the year. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) say that it is only \ntaken from them once a year. We have what 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) did. The use and judgment are repeated when the cause is \nrepeated.  \n \n25.13g Food for Makka or Madina  \n \nIf they are carrying food destined specifically for Makka or \nMadina only one-twentieth of what they sell it for should \nbe taken \n  \nIf the people of the dhimma carry food, meaning wheat and oil, or \nit is said that it means all food products. As for things other than \nfood, like goods, the full tenth is taken from their price.  \n \n25.13h Harbi traders paying a tenth  \n \nA tenth is also levied from traders who come from Dar al-\nHarb (the land of war - beyond the frontiers of Islam)  \n \nThis is on what they bring whether they sell or not, and whether \nthey sell in one land or all of the lands of Islam. It is the position \nof Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi). His position was \ngiven about the people of dhimma that it is not taken from them \nuntil there is a sale. There is a difference between them is that the \npeople of harb obtain security while they are in the land of Islam, \nand all lands of Islam are like one land. As for the people of \ndhimma, it is taken from them by their benefit and they are not \nforbidden our lands. So when their benefit is repeated, taking \nfrom them is repeated. The apparent meaning of the words of the \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that the tenth is not decreased, \neven if the Imam thinks that should be done. That is that position \nof Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh Ashhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). In short, if it before alighting, an agreement \ncan be made with them for more than a tenth. If it is after they \ncamp, only a tenth is taken from them. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It is taken from them according to the \nopinion of the ruler.\" There may be stipulation for more than that \nwhen a safe conduct has been previously agreed.  \n \n25.13i When other terms have been agreed  \n \nunless they have agreed to terms demanding more than \nthat \n  \nIt is permitted to take the greater amount which is stipulated. \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said: they cannot sell wine \nto a Muslim by agreement. The well-known position is that they \nare able to sell it to others. There is the text of the words of \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \"When they bring wine \nand pigs and there are people of dhimma who buy that from them, \nthey are left, and the tenth is taken from them after selling. If \nthere is no one there to buy that from them, they return with it \nand are not allowed to import it.  \n \n25.14 Treasure-trove  \n \n25.14a What treasure-trove is  \n \nIf someone comes upon treasure (rikaz) that was buried in \nthe time of the Jahiliyya (before Islam)  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) added in al-Wadiha that it \nis (rikaz) in particular. Kanz is applied to what was buried in the \nJahiliyya and buried in Islam. There is disagreement about \nwhether it is particular to gold and silver or general, including \nother things like pearls, copper and lead. There are two positions \nreported by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). The author of the \nMukhtasar confines himself to the second, and says that it is \napplied to treasure-trove. If he doubts whether it is jahili or not, \nthen the signs are studied. If there are none, that was mostly done \nby them. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is known \nto be part of the school which Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \npreferred it. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported \nthat it is particular to gold and silver and its judgment is obliged \non it.  \n \n25.14b What is paid on it  \n \nhe must pay the fifth \n  \nThe apparent meaning would be even if it is less than the \nminimum, and this is the case in the well-known position because \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  said, \"There is a fifth on \ntreasure\" and that is general to a lot and a little. It is also clear \nthat Islam and freedom are not preconditions. It also appears that \nthere is a fifth in it, even if it is found by a lot of expense or work \nin extracting it. There is zakat on it according to what is in the \nMudawwana and Muwatta'.  \n \nIt also appears that it is absolutely belongs to the one who finds it. \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  affirmed that, but that is \nnot always the case. If it is found in the wilds of the land of Islam, \nit belongs to its finder. If he finds in it in someone's property, then \nit is his by agreement. This is the judgment of treasure.  \n \nAs for what the sea throws up to the shore, like amber, pearls and \nother jewelry which he finds, they belong to the one who finds \nthem and there is no fifth. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said unless prior protected ownership is proven by a \nMuslim or Dhimmî. There are two statements: Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) heard that someone who discards his \ngoods out of fear of drowning takes them from the one who \nappropriated them. It is like that what he leaves due to \nconstriction and is unable to take. There are two positions.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty Six: On the Zakat of Livestock \n \n \n26.1. Its judgment  \n \nZakat on camels, cows, sheep and goats is obligatory \n  \nZakat is obliged on what was mentioned. That is stated by Malikis \nsince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no \nzakat owed by a Muslim on his horses or slaves.\" The apparent \nwords of the author is that zakat is obliged on livestock absolutely, \nfoddered or work animals. It is the School. According to Imam Abu \nHanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam ash-Shafi‟i(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), there is no zakat on work animals since he said, \"There is \nzakat on grazing sheep.\" He begins with the obligation of zakat on \ncamels to follow the hadith since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did that in the letter on zakat written for Amr ibn Hazm \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu). There are 11 obligations in its zakat, four of \nwhich are taken from a different species, sheep, and seven which \nare taken from camels.  \n \n26.2 On Camels  \n \n26.2a Five to nine camels  \n \nThere is no zakat on less than five camels but on five to \nnine camels you must give either a sheep or a goat which is \nin its second year depending on which of the two animals \nis most commonly kept by the people of the area \n  \nWhen it reaches this number, one owes a sheep which has been \nalive for one year and begun the next. There is no difference \nbetween the male and female sheep or goat. The judgment is \nbased on what is common. If it is sheep, it is taken from sheep. If \nit is goats, it is taken from them. If the owner of the property gives \na camel instead of the obliged sheep, it is permissible because it is \nof the same type of property and is worth more than is what is \nobliged of him. The limit for a single sheep is nine. So the shortfall \n(waqs) is four, which is the smallest waqs.  \n \n26.2b Ten to twenty-five  \n \nYou must give two sheep or goats for ten to fourteen \ncamels and three sheep or goats for fifteen to nineteen \ncamels. For twenty to twenty-five camels you must give \nfour sheep or goats \n  \nThe shortfall in each of these categories are four.  \n \n26.2c Twenty-five to thirty-five  \n \nFor twenty-five to thirty-five camels you must give a \nfemale camel in its second year (bint makhad) or if there is \nnot one available a male camel in its third year (ibn labun) \n  \nIt appears that it has completed two years, and elsewhere it states \nthat it has begun the second year. It is called bint makhad \nbecause its mother has given birth because the camel is pregnant \nfor a year and cares for the young for a year. If there are none \navailable or it is damaged, then it is necessary to take a male \nwhich has completed the second year and begun the third. If there \nis neither, the collector charges him for a bint makhad, whether \nhe likes it or not, and then makes the judgment of the absence of \nboth of them like that of their existence. Then he comes with a ibn \nlabun at that point, it is up to the collector to do what he thinks \nbest. If he thinks it right, he takes it. Otherwise he obliges him \nthe bint makhad.  \n \n26.2d Thirty-six to forty-five  \n \nFor thirty-six to forty-five camels you must give a female \ncamel aged between two and five years (bint labun) \n  \nThe shortfall in this is ten. What is meant is not having lived \nthree full years, but what has two full years and begun the third. \nThe shortfall at the end is nine.  \n \n26.2e Forty-six to sixty  \n \nFor forty-six to sixty camels you must give a female camel \nin its fourth year capable of carrying loads and bearing \nchildren (hiqqa) \n  \nIf he pays it with two bint labuns, that does not satisfy it, even if \nthey are equal in their value to its value as opposed to the view \nImam ash-Shafi‟i(rahmatullahi alaihi). What is meant is what has \ncompleted its third year and begun its fourth. The shortfall in this \nobligation is 14.  \n \n26.2f Sixty-one to seventy-five  \n \nFor sixty-one to seventy-five camels you must give a female \ncamel in its fifth year (jadh'a) \n  \nThen after this the obligation changes. What is meant is one \nwhich has completed its fourth year and begun the fifth. It is the \nlast of the categories taken for paying the zakat of camels. The \nshortfall is fourteen.  \n \n26.2g Seventy-six to ninety \n  \nFor seventy-six to ninety camels you must give two female \ncamels in their third year (bint labun)  \n \nThe shortfall is fourteen.  \n \n26.2h Ninety-one to 120  \n \nFor ninety-one to one hundred and twenty camels you \nmust give two hiqqas  \n \nThe shortfall is twenty-nine.   \n \n26.2i More than 120  \n \nFor any more than this you give one hiqqa for every fifty \ncamels and one bint labun for every forty \n  \nFor more than one hundred twenty, the obligation is this.  \n \n26.3 Zakat on cattle  \n \n26.3a The nisab  \n \nThere is no zakat on less than thirty cattle \n  \nIts nisab is thirty. Forty and more are subject.  \n \n26.3b Thirty to forty  \n \nIf there are thirty you must give one in its third year (tabi') \n  \nThirty to forty  have a calf in its third year, which is called that \nbecause it follows its mother. It is would appear from the words \nthat it is a precondition that it be male, but that is not the case. \nThe well-known position is that it is not a precondition. It must \nhave completed two years.  \n \n26.3c Forty  \n \nThis applies up to forty. If there are forty you must give a \ncow in its fourth year (musinna or thaniyya) - only females \nare acceptable \n  \nWhen the number reaches forty, the obligation changes. One owes \na cow in the fourth year, and it is only taken in females. If there is \nno four year old cow, its owner is compelled to bring it unless he \ngives better than it, which is a five year cow. The musinna has full \nfour years according to Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n26.3d Third nisab: More than forty  \n \nIf there are more than that you must give a musinna for \nevery forty and a tabi' for every thirty  \n \nIf there are five more than forty, there is nothing on it. If it \nreaches fifty, there is nothing on the ten in our view. When it \nreaches sixty, there are two tabi' on them. If it reaches seventy, \nthere is a tabi' and a musinna. If it reaches eighty, there are two \nmusinna. What is more goes according to its rule.  \n \n26.4 Zakat on sheep and goats  \n \n26.4a Nisab and up to one hundred twenty  \n \nThere is no zakat on sheep and goats until their number \nreaches forty. If you pass forty you must give one in its \nfifth year (jadh'a) or one in its fourth year (thaniyya). This \napplies up to one hundred and twenty animals \n  \nNeither male or female is specified. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that it was clarified in the nisab of \ncamels.  \n \n26.4b Second nisab: one hundred twenty to two hundred  \n \nIf you have between one hundred and twenty and two \nhundred sheep and/or goats you must give two \n  \nSo the shortfall is eighty. Then he indicates the second obligation \nand its shortfall here is seventy-nine.  \n \n26.4c Third nisab: two hundred  to three hundred \n \nFor two hundred and one to three hundred you must give \nthree and for every additional hundred you give one \nanimal \n  \nHe said in al-Jallab (rahmatullahi alaihi), in what is more than \nthree hundred, there is a sheep for every one hundred. For three \nhundred ninety-nine there are three sheep and for four hundred \nthere are four sheep and for five hundred there are five sheep and \nso forth.  \n \n26.5 Computation of zakat on animals  \n \n26.5a No zakat on shortfalls  \n \nZakat is not required on any number of animals between \nthe figures mentioned and this ruling applies to all the \ntypes of animals mentioned above \n  \nThen he explains the judgment of the shortfall between the \nobligations, saying that there is no zakat on the shortfalls. The \nshortfall is what falls short of the nisab. It is a technical term for \nall the types of livestock.  \n \n26.5b Sheep and goats are one category  \n \nSheep and goats are considered as one category for zakat \npurposes  \n \nThis is by consensus. That is what he said in at-Tahqiq because \nthe name of the species includes both of them in the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). So there is a sheep for every \nforty goats.  \n \n26.5c Cattle and buffaloes are one category  \n \nas are cattle and buffaloes  \n \nThis is by agreement because the generic name includes them all, \nas the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is a tabi' \nin every thirty.  \n \n26.5d Bactrian and dromedary camels are one category  \n \nand also Bactrian and dromedary camels \n  \nThese are the camels of the people of Khurassan since camel is \nused for both of them in the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam).  \n \n26.6 The zakat of joint owners  \n \n26.6a How it is paid  \n \nThe owners of herds which are mixed together pay zakat \njointly and settle between themselves the share each must \npay \n  \nThis is according to the number of animals. That partnership on \nwhich it is obliged has the following preconditions: it is taken from \nthe two owners as it is taken from one owner in amount, age, and \ncategory as was mentioned. If each of three has forty sheep, then \none sheep is obliged, each owing a third. The example of the \nsecond is that when each has thirty six camels and then a jadh'a is \nobliged and each owes a half. The third is that one has eighty \nsheep and the other forty goats, and one sheep is obliged, two \nthirds from one and one-third from the other.  \n \nThe benefit of partnership can be lightening as when each has \nforty sheep. On their own, they would each owe one sheep, and \ntogether they owe only one sheep. It could make it heavier as \nwhen each has one hundred twenty sheep and each of them would \nonly owe one sheep, but they owe three sheep when they are \ntogether. Or it may have no benefit, as when each has one \nhundred sheep and each alone would owe one, and it is the same \ntogether. A precondition for the two owners being like one is that \neach of them has a nisab.  \n \n26.6c Settlement is according to the state of herd  \n \nWhen the zakat of the year is due, animals which were \nmixed together are not to be separated nor those which \nwere separate to be mixed out of fear of paying the zakat \n  \nThat is when the end of the year approaches. Shaikh ibn Shash \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that that is when joining or separating \nwould reduce the zakat.   \n \n26.6d If the zakat is less because of mixing  \n \nIf the zakat paid is less because the two herds were \nseparated or mixed, the herds should be restored to their \nprior condition \n  \nWhen it is done to avoid more zakat. As when two men each have \na hundred, and so they separate at the end of the year and two \nsheep are obliged. The obligation on them is three. It is the same \nfor joining: three men each has forty and they join at the end of \nthe year so that one sheep is obliged on them: the obligation on \nthem is three sheep.  \n \n26.6b Those who do not have to pay  \n \nThere is no zakat due from someone whose share does not \nreach the number subject to zakat \n  \nBecause of the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \n\"There is no zakat on less than five camels.\" They must be liable \nfor zakat (and so they are not slaves or unbelievers) and the \nanimals have the same stud, shepherd, resting place at night, \npasturage, watering-place and milking place, and the partnership \nis by friendship, not avoidance of zakat.  \n \n26.7 Prohibited forms of payment  \n \n26.7a Baby animals  \n \nA baby sheep or goat is not taken to pay zakat. However, it \nis counted in numbering the owner's flock. Baby calves or \ncamels are not taken, but they are counted in numbering \nthe herd. Similarly, exempt from being taken as zakat are \nyoung Billy goats, thin old females, pregnant females, a \nram used for stud, a sheep or goat fattened for slaughter, a \nfemale nursing its young, nor the best of a man's property \n  \nZakat is not taken from the best or worst of a man's property. One \nis to protect the rights of the wealthy and the other to protect the \nrights of poor. If the owner gives the best cheerfully, it is \npermitted. If he gives the worst, it is not acceptable. If all the \nproperty is good or bad, he is obliged the middle. If he refuses, he \nis forced to pay it. \n  \n26.7b Not taking cash or goods in lieu  \n \nFor zakat on animals, one may not collect goods or the \nprice of the animal in place of the animal. If the collector \nforces the owner into giving the price of the animal or \nsomething else, that satisfies it, Allah willing \n  \nSomething else would be like grains. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) states that paying the price voluntarily does \nnot satisfy it. But it is taken by force, then it satisfies it in the \nwell-known position.  \n \n26.7c Debts do not cancel this duty  \n \nA debt does not cancel one's obligation to pay zakat on \ngrain, fruit or animals  \n \nIt was mentioned earlier.  \n \nSUPPLEMENT about a number of important questions:  \n \n1. He must pay it with the intention of paying zakat. If he pays it \nwithout the intention of paying zakat, it does not satisfy it unless \nhe is forced, and then the intention of the forcer is enough.  \n \n2. It is not transferred from the place in which it is obliged unless \nthere is no one there to pay it to. Then it is transferred to the \nclosest place to it.  \n \n3. It is paid at the time when is obliged. If it is delayed, it is \nallowed but he commits something unlawful. \n  \n4. He pays it in its eight categories which Allah azza wa jall \nmentioned when He says, \"Collected sadaqa is for: the poor, the \ndestitute, those who collect it, bringing people's hearts together, \nfreeing slaves, those in debt, spending in the way of Allah, and \ntravelers.\" (Holy Qur‟an 9:60)  \n \n \n \n \nChapter Twenty-Seven: On the Zakat al-Fitr \n \n \n27.1 Its ruling  \n \nThe zakat al-Fitr is an obligatory Sunnah which the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) made compulsory for all \nMuslims, whether old or young, male or female, free or \nslave \n  \nIt is a confirmed Sunnah. It seems that is obligatory in the School. \nThere is disagreement about the words \"the Rasulullah (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) made it compulsory\". It is said that it means he \nstipulated it and so it is Sunnah, and that does not contradict his \nwords, \"On all, whether old or young.\" The Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) uses the terms for what is less than obligatory. The \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Zakat al-Fitr after \nRamadan obligatory for the Muslims - slave or free, male or \nfemale, young or old, being a sa' of dates or a sa' of barley.\" It is \nsaid that it means that he made it compulsory. That what the \nauthor of Mukhtasar thinks.  \n \n27.2 Its amount  \n \n27.2a Its measure  \n \nIts amount is one sa'a measuring by the sa'a of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) \n \nIt is four mudds by the mudd of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). A sa'a is a measure of volume equivalent to 4 mudds. A \nmudd is the amount contained by a man's cupped hands  \n \n27.2b What it is paid in  \n \nIt should be paid in kind using the staple food of the \npeople of the region, which might be wheat or barley or \nsult barley or dates or dried cheese or raisins or millet or \nsorghum or rice. It is also said that if the staple food of the \npeople is al-'alas, which is a small grain similar to wheat, \nthat the zakat al-fitr can be paid with that \n  \nThe land where the zakat is paid, whether their food is like his \nfood or better or worse. If his food is better than their food and he \npays the zakat in it, that is allowed. If it is less valuable than \ntheir food, and he pays it with it out of avarice, then the apparent \nwords of Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) mean that it \ndoes not satisfy the requirement by agreement.  \n \nIf he pays it from other than these nine types, it is not allowed in \nthe well-known position. This is when some or all of them exist as \nfoods. If they do not exist, all or some, and other things are used \nas food, they satisfy the requirement.  \n \n27.3 Who pays the zakat of children and slaves  \n \nThe zakat al-fitr of a slave is paid by his master and that of \na young child, who has no personal wealth, by his father. A \nman has to pay the zakat of every Muslim for whose \nmaintenance he is responsible, and he should also pay for \nhis mukatab (partially freed slave) because even if he is \nnot responsible for his maintenance, the mukatab is \nnevertheless still his slave \n  \nThe father pays for the child who has no wealth. It is understood \nfrom this that he does not pay for an adult. It is not absolute: if he \nis male, adult and wealthy, he does not pay for him. If he becomes \nadult within the time it is due, he prays for him. He pays for the \nfemale, even if she is adult, until she marries. What is understood \nby \"no personal wealth\" is that if he has wealth, he does not pay \nfor him. That is the case. It is paid by Muslims, but not \nunbelievers.  \n \n27.4 When it is paid  \n \nIt is recommended to pay the zakat al-fitr at daybreak on \nthe day of the ‘Id al-Fitr \n  \nIn Muslim it reports that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nused to command that the zakat al-fitr be paid before people went \nout to the place of prayer. This is the time of recommendation and \nnot the time of obligation. There are two well-known statements \nabout that. One is that it becomes obligatory at sunset of the last \nof the day of Ramadan and ends at the rising of dawn on the day \nof the „Id. It is permitted that it be paid a day or two before the \nday of fitr. It is not canceled when its time passes because it is a \nright of the poor for which liability remains. He does not sin as \nlong as the day of Fitr still remains. If he delays it when he is able \nto pay it, he sins. He gives to a free poor Muslim. He does not give \nit to an unbeliever, nor to a wealthy man. \n  \n27.5 Other things about ‘Id al-Fitr  \n \n27.5a Breaking the fast before the prayer  \n \nOn the morning of the ‘Id al-Fitr, it is recommended to \nbreak your fast before leaving for the prayer-place, \nwhereas on the morning of the ‘Id al-Ad-ha it is \nrecommended not to do so \n  \nBreak it with anything, but it is best that it be broken with dates, \nan odd number, based on what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did. It is not recommended to break it on the morning of „Id \nal-Adha. Then it is recommended to refrain until you return from \nthe prayer so that you can eat from the sacrifice since that it what \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did.  \n \n27.5b Varying the route  \n \nOn both ‘Ids, however, it is recommended to go to the \nprayer by one route and return from it by another \n  \n \n \nChapter Twenty Eight: On Hajj and 'Umra  \n \n \n28.1 The obligation of the Hajj \n \n28.1a The meaning of hajj  \n \nEach word has a linguistic and technical meaning. Linguistically, \nhajj means to aim for something once or to do something time \nafter time or a simple intention. This usage is like the words of the \nAlmighty, \"And when We made the House a place to return to, a \nsanctuary for mankind.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:125) Its technical usage \ndesignates an act of worship which contains ihram, standing, \ntawaf, sa'y and other things.  \n \nLinguistically 'umra means to visit. Linguistically it designates an \nact of worship which has ihram, standing, tawaf, sa'y which \nbegins like the hajj.   \n \n28.1b The word Bakka  \n \nGoing on hajj to the Sacred House of Allah azza wa jall, \nsituated in Bakka \n  \n\"Bakka\" is used to honor it.  \n \n28.1c Preconditions of its obligation  \n \nis an obligation for every free adult Muslim, who is able to \nfind a way to do it, once during his lifetime \n  \n1. Ability  \n \nIt is obligatory when five preconditions are meant. He indicates \none of them: who is 'able to find a way to it', i.e. to the House of \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \n2. Islam  \n \nIslam is a precondition for the obligation. That is what Shaikh ibn \nal-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) and the author of the Mukhtasar \nsay. It is a precondition for its validity. According to the first, \ndisbelief is a barrier to its obligation, and according to the second, \nto its validity.  \n \n3. Freedom  \n \nThe third precondition is freedom.  \n \n4. Adulthood  \n \nThe fourth is adulthood. The precondition of adulthood is not \nconfined to the hajj.  \n \n5. Sanity  \n \nThe final precondition remains, which is sanity. The hajj is not \nobliged for someone who is insane. \n  \nHajj is obligatory for the one who is legally responsible and meets \nthe preconditions. If someone who is not legally responsible makes \nthe hajj, his hajj is valid but the obligatory hajj is not achieved for \nhim.  \n \nIts obligation is indicated by the Book, Sunnah and consensus. \nWhoever denies that it is obligatory is an unbeliever. If anyone \naffirms its obligatory nature but refuses to do it, will be called to \nreckoning by Allah azza wa jall. Hajj is obligatory on the one who \nmeets the preconditions once in his lifetime by consensus.  \n \n28.1d The meaning of \"way\"  \n \nWhat is meant by \"way\" is a safe route, sufficient provisions \nto reach Makka, sufficient strength to be able to get to \nMakka and a good state of health \n  \nThis expression covers four things:  \n1. It must be a safe route. If he fears for himself, it is agreed that \nthe obligation is canceled. If he fears for some of his property and \ninjury, it is canceled for him. If he would not be injured, it is \ncanceled for him by one statement.  \n \n2. Provisions. Apparently he only considers what will enable him \nto reach it. That is what Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid. He qualified that by saying, \"Unless he knows that if he \nremains there, he will die and he fears for himself. Then he \nconsiders what is adequate for the return journey to the nearest \nplace he can stay in it and sell to buy provisions and other things.  \n \n3. Physical ability. The third is the strength to arrive on foot or \nriding. When the blind person finds someone to guide him and \nthere is no enormous difficulty, then it is obliged for him.  \n \n4. Health. Some say it is a part of strength and some say it is a \nfourth precondition. Hajj is not obligatory for the sick person, even \nif he can find something to ride.  \n \nThe hajj has obligations, Sunnah‟s and excellent parts. The \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) did not clarify them. He described \nthe hajj in the actual order in which it is performed. We will, \ninsha‟Allah, point the various parts. One of the obligations is \nihram.   \n \n28.2 Ihram  \n \n28.2a Its miqats  \n \nYou should go into 'ihram' at the appropriate miqat \n  \nIt has two miqats: one in time and one in place. \n  \n1. The Miqat of time  \n \nThe miqat of time was mentioned by the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi): that is the months of Shawwal, Dhu'l-Qi'da, and all of \nDhu'l-Hijja in the famous position. It is said it is only the first ten \ndays of Dhu'l-Hijja. Disagreement arises when the Tawaf al-Ifada \nis delayed. In the famous position, sacrifice is not obliged for him \nunless it is delayed to Muharram. In the other position, it is when \nit is knowingly delayed to the 11th. The defined time is the time of \nthe hajj, including entering ihram and ending it, not only ihram \nonly. If he goes into ihram before Shawwal, that is disliked. \n  \n2. The Miqat of place  \n \nIf he goes into ihram before that, it is disliked. It is recommended \nnot to delay going into ihram because hastening to obey is better. \nIt varies according to the different states of those going into \nihram. The miqat of the Makkan is Makka. It is recommended for \nhim to go into ihram from inside the masjid. His miqat for 'umra \nand for qiran is coming out of ihram because every ihram must \ncombine being both in and out of ihram. The miqat of someone \nfrom outside Makka varies and it is one of five places with the \ndifferences of fiqh, about whether he goes into ihram for hajj or \n'umra.  \n \n28.2b Physical miqats  \n \nThe miqat for the people of Syria, Egypt and North Africa \nis Juhfa, but if they come via Madina, it is better for them \nto go into ihram at the miqat of the people of Madina \nwhich is Dhu'l-Hulayfa. The miqat of the people of Iraq is \nDhat Irq and that of the people of Yaman, Yalamlam. The \npeople of Najd go into ihram at Qarn. If any of these go via \nMadina they too should go into ihram at Dhu'l-Hulayfa \nsince they will NOT be passing their own miqat again \n  \nJuhfa is a town about seven stages from Madina and three or five \nfrom Makka. If people of these regions come via Madina, they \nadopt the miqat of the Madinans. Dhu'l-Hulayfa is about six miles \nfrom Madina. It is the furthest of the miqats from Madina. There \nis about ten stages from Makka. Iraq also includes places further \non like Iran. Dhat 'Irq is a ruined town two stages from Makka. \nYalamlam is a mountain of Tihama two stages from Makka. Qarn \nis a small mountain apart from the mountains opposite Makka \nand two stages from it. Those who make hajj by sea from the \nEgypt and the like go into ihram when they are opposite Juhfa.  \n \n28.2c How to go into ihram  \n \nWhen going into ihram you should do so straight after praying, \nwhether that prayer is fard or nafila. You start by saying, \n\"Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk, Labbayk la sharika lak inna'l-\nhamda wa ni'mata laka wa'l-mulk, la sharika lak.\" (At Your \nservice, O Allah, at Your service. At Your service, none can be \nassociated with You, at Your service. All praise and blessing is due \nto You as is the Kingdom. None can be associated with You.)  \n \nIt is Sunnah to say this. In short, the talbiyya is obligation in \nitself. So if you were to omit it, you are obliged to sacrifice. It is \nSunnah that it accompany going in ihram. \"Labbayk \" means an \nanswer after command, The answer is in response the words of the \nAlmighty, \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said, \"Yes\" (bala). It also \nrefers to the fact that when Nabi Ibrahim (alaihi salam) asked \npermission for people to make hajj and he called out, \"O people! \nAllah has a House so make hajj,\" they answered him from the east \nand the west of the earth and from the wombs of the women and \nthe loins of the men. Some people prefer to stop at \"mulk\" and \nstart a new sentence with \"la sharik\".  \n \n28.2d The intention  \n \nYou say this and make the intention to do Hajj or 'umra \naccording to what you are intending to do \n  \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said according to the \nposition of Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) ihram begins \nby the intention and the word, i.e. the talbiya. He considers the \ntalbiya a precondition for its validity and so it has the same \nposition as the takbir al-Ihram in the prayer. Shaikh Khalil \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the reality of ihram is to enter \nwith the intention into one of the two practices with the word \nconnected to it, like the talbiya, or an action connected to it, like \nturning to the road. Ihram does not begin simply by the intention. \nThere must be the word, like the talbiyya, or an action, like \nturning to the road. One of the special qualities of the talbiyya is \nnot that it is a precondition for the validity of ihram as Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated. It revolves around the \nexistence of one of two - word or deed. It is recommended to \nconfine oneself to the talbiyya mentioned because it was the \ntalbiyya of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n28.2e Performing a ghusl  \n \nThen you should have a ghusl  \n \nEven if a woman is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth since \nit is Sunnah. This is based on what Shaikh at-Tirmidhi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported: the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) stripped for ihram and performed a ghusl before he \nassumed ihram. There is no sacrifice for omitting it either \ndeliberately or out of forgetfulness. That is also the case with the \nrest of the ghusls of the hajj. The evidence that it is Sunnah for \nthe woman in menstruation or bleeding is what comes in the \nMuwatta' that Asma' (radhi‟Allahu anha) gave birth and when \nAbu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) mentioned that to the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) he said, \"Tell her to perform a ghusl and \nthen enter ihram.\" It is recommended for the one who wants to \nassume ihram for hajj or 'umra to clip his nails, shave his private \nparts and trim his beard, but he does not shave his head since \ndishevelment is desirable. \n  \n28.2f Removing stitched clothing  \n \nand remove any clothes containing stitching before \nactually entering the state of ihram \n  \nIt is Sunnah for men to remove any stitched garments and to wear \na wrapper, cloak and sandals.  \n \n28.2g A ghusl when entering Makka  \n \nIt is also recommended to have a ghusl when you enter \nMakka \n  \nThis is for the one in ihram, who is not menstruating or in lochia. \nIt is best that it be at Dhu Tuwa since that is what the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did.  \n \n28.2h Continuing the talbiya  \n \nYou should continue to recite the talbiya (as mentioned \nabove) after all prayers, at the summit of every rise and \nevery time you rejoin your traveling companions \n  \nThe muhrim does the talbiya after the obligatory and nafila \nprayers, and at every high place and in the valleys. His 'traveling \ncompanions' are those he camps and travels with. He also says it \nwhen he wakes up from sleep. The one saying the talbiya does not \nreturn the greeting until he finishes. He is recommended to raise \nhis voice in the talbiya to a medium level. The woman should only \nbe able to hear herself. It is not disliked for a woman in \nmenstruation or lochia to say the talbiya.  \n \n28.2i Not being excessive in the talbiya  \n \nHowever, you should not go to excess in it \n  \nThis is not recommended or obligatory. Indeed, it is disliked by \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). This means doing it a lot \nconstantly so that he does not cease that. When he does not cease, \nhe is not silent so that he misses the ceremony.  \n \n28.3 Entering Makka  \n \n28.3a Stopping the talbiya and restarting it  \n \nWhen you enter Makka you stop reciting the talbiya until \nafter you have completed your tawaf and sa'y. Then you \nstart doing it again until midday on the Day of 'Arafa, if \nyou have got to the place of prayer on 'Arafa \n  \nIt is related that he stops it at the Jamra al-'Aqaba. Shaikh al-\nLakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi) inclined to what is in Sahih Muslim \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) continued to do the \ntalbiya until he stoned the Jamra al-'Aqaba.  \n \n28.3b Where to enter Makka  \n \nIt is recommended to enter Makka through the pass of \nKada' in Upper Makka and to leave it by Kuda, but it does \nnot matter if you do not do this \n  \nThis is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that \nand the Companions after him (alaihi salat wa salam) did so as \nwell. It is recommended to enter it in the day since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. If someone enters before \nsunrise, he does not do tawaf. If he does tawaf, he does not pray \nuntil sunrise. Nafila prayers are lawful. When a woman arrives in \nthe day, she is recommended to delay tawaf until night. When \nsomeone leaves, it is recommended that he go by Kuda, which is \nthe bottom of Makka. There is no sin if he does not do this, \nbecause he has not omitted something obligatory.  \n \n28.3c The first thing done after entering Makka  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that all those \nentering Makka should first of all go straight to the Masjid \nal-Haram, which it is recommended to enter by the door of \nBani Shayba \n  \nAnd no where else unless it is unavoidable - like tying up one's \nmount and having a little food. Delay is bad manners. This is now \nknown as the Door of Peace. That is because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) did that. After someone enters, he should \ndo tawaf by making the intention and make for the Black Stone.  \n \n28.4 The Tawaf  \n \n28.4a Greeting the Black Stone  \n \nYou should greet the Black Stone by kissing it, if possible, \nor if you cannot then by touching it and putting your hand \nto your mouth without kissing it \n  \nIf he cannot touch it with his hand, he touches it with his stick \nand then places it to his mouth without kissing it. A stick is not \nadequate when the hand is possible and nor the hand when \nkissing is possible. This kissing is a sunnah at the beginning of \nthe tawaf and recommended in the rest of it. The evidence for \nkissing is in the two Sahih collections that 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) kissed it and said, \"I know that you are a merely a stone \nwhich can bestow neither harm nor benefit. If it had not been that \nI had seen the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) kiss you, I would \nnot have kissed you.\"  \n \n28.4b The Tawaf of Arrival  \n \nThen you do tawaf keeping the House on your left, going \nround it seven times \n  \nAfter kissing the Black Stone, you perform Tawaf of Arrival. It is \nobligatory for every one who assumes ihram, whether he is one of \nthe people of Makka or elsewhere. When he goes into ihram from \nthe Haram, he does not do the Tawaf of arrival since he is not \narriving.  \n \nTawaf, whether it is a pillar, obligation or desirable practice, has \nobligatory parts, sunan and recommended parts.  \n \n28.4c The Obligatory parts of Tawaf  \n \nIt has six obligatory parts, the first ones being the preconditions \nfor the prayer:  \n \n1. Purity from ritual impurity and uncleanness, and covering the \nprivate parts. If he breaks wudu' while performing it, he purifies \nhimself and begins again, based on the famous position. Speech is \npermitted in it since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"Tawaf of the House is prayer although Allah has allowed \nspeech in it, so one should only speak good.\"  \n \n2.  Tawaf is done inside the masjid.  \n \n3.  He puts the House on his left. If he puts it on his right, his \ntawaf is not valid and he must repeat it. He should take care \nwhen he begins the tawaf and stand a little before the corner so \nthat the Stone is on his right of where he stands. That is what \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. If he does not \ncompletely encompass the Stone, he has not completed the first \ncircuit. He should take note of that: the ignorant often err in \nthat. His tawaf is outside the House, and the one who kisses \nthe Black Stone must only walk after he had stood upright as \nbefore. He is not permitted to kiss it and then walk with bowed \nhead or his hand so that he does not achieve some of the tawaf. \nAll his body would not be outside the House because part of his \nbody is on the buttress, which is part of the House and thus his \ntawaf would not be valid.  \n \n4.  Seven circuits. He begins from the Stone and ends at the Black \nStone. If he begins from the Yemeni corner, he ends with it and \nmust sacrifice.  \n \n5.  Continuity. If he forgets a circuit and then remembers soon \nafter and has not broken wudu', he returns to it, as he would to \nthe prayer. If it is a long time, then the tawaf is invalid by \nanalogy with the prayer.  \n \n6. Praying two rak'ats after it.]  \n \n28.4d Its sunan  \n \nThree times at a fast pace between walking and running \nand four times at a normal walking pace \n  \nIts sunan are four:  \n \n1. One is the fast pace three times, which is going faster than \nwalking but not running. It is Sunnah for the man and not the \nwoman, even if he is ill. He owes no sacrifice for omitting it, even \nif he able to do it. Then four circuits are done walking. The \nevidence for all of this is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did it.  \n \n2. Supplication, which is not defined.  \n \n3. Kissing the Black Stone at the beginning of the tawaf as was \nsaid.  \n \n4. Kissing the Yemeni Corner in the first circuit.  \n \n28.4e Recommended parts  \n \nEvery time you pass the Black Stone, you greet it in the \nway we have already mentioned and say 'Allahu Akbar'. \nYou do not kiss the Yamani corner but you greet it by \ntouching it with your hand which you then raise to your \nmouth without missing it  \n \nIts recommended parts are four:  \n \n1. Kissing the Black Stone in the beginning of every circuit except \nthe first if you are able to do so. Otherwise you place your hand on \nit and then on your mouth without kissing it. You do this while \nsaying the takbir.  \n \n2. Kissing the Yemeni corner at the beginning of every circuit \nother than the first.  \n \n3. Going close to the House for men rather women.  \n \n4. Supplication at the Multazam after finishing the tawaf. The \nMultazam is between the Yemeni corner and the door. He hugs it \nand makes intense supplication.  \n \n28.4f Two rak'ats at the end  \n \nWhen you have finished your tawaf you pray two rak’ats at \nthe Maqam Ibrahim. Then if you are able to you greet the \nBlack Stone once more  \n \nHis words include an obligation and two recommended parts. The \nobligation is to do two rak'ats after tawaf . The two \nrecommendations are doing it at the Maqam and connecting them \nto tawaf. It would mean that there is no sacrifice at all on account \nof not connecting them: but that is not the case. There is a \nsacrifice in some instances. Nor is the recommendation absolute: it \nis recommended for some and obligatory for some in which case \nthere is a sacrifice as a consequence of omitting it.  \n \nSo someone who does not do two rak'ats until he is far away or has \nreturned home must absolutely perform them. If they are part of \nan obligatory tawaf he owes a sacrifice. If they are from another \ntawaf, then no sacrifice is obliged for that. If he has not gone far or \nreturned to his land and has not broken his purity, then he only \nperforms two rak'ats. If his purification is broken deliberately, he \ndoes the tawaf and two rak'ats, even if they are not obligatory and \nrepeats the tawaf, the two rak'ats, and sa'y. In other than that he \nrepeats it. Does he repeat the tawaf or not? The apparent meaning \nis to prefer the second, and he does not kiss the Yemeni corner. \nAfter Kissing the Black Stone it is recommended to go to Zamzam \nand drink from it.  \n \n28.5 Sa'y at Safa and Marwa  \n \n28.5a Beginning sa'y  \n \nand then go off to Safa where you stand and make du'a \n  \nShaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that it is recommended to leave by the \ndoor of Safa since it is closest to Safa. Shaikh Zarruq \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted from Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) went out by it.  \n \n28.5b Going to Marwa  \n \nFrom there you walk to Marwa going faster across the \nbottom of the valley. When you reach Marwa you stand for \na time making du'a and then walk back to Safa. You do this \nseven times, standing four times on Safa and four times on \nMarwa \n  \nHe should walk quickly in the bottom of the valley, particularly \nwhen going to Marwa: this is the Sunnah for men rather than \nwomen. The valley is what is between the two green markers \nwhich are on the wall of the Masjid al-Haram to the left going to \nMarwa. The first of them is at the corner of the masjid under the \nminaret and the second is opposite Ribat al-'Abbas. The \nsupplication made on Marwa and Safa is not specified. Stopping \nthere is Sunnah.  \n \nThis sa'y is one of the pillars of the hajj and 'umra which is \nnecessary and no sacrifice or anything else can compensate for its \nomission. Its obligatory nature is indicated by the Book and \nSunnah. It has preconditions, sunan and recommended parts.  \n \nIts preconditions are four:  \n \n1. The proper order, which is that sa'y is done after tawaf. If he \nbegins with sa'y, he returns and does sa'y .  \n \n2. Continuity, If he sits for a long time and becomes like someone \nwho stops, he must begin the sa'y again. If it is a short stop, it \ndoes not impair it. If he is afflicted by incontinence he does wudu' \nan d builds on what he has done. Speech in it is less than speech \nin tawaf, i.e. he should only speak softly.  \n \n3. Completing the number: seven. If anyone omits a circuit of hajj \nor 'umra, whether the hajj or 'umra are sound or unsound, he \nshould return for that from his land. If anyone omits a cubit of the \nsa'y, that is not adequate.  \n \n4. It should be preceded it by a sound tawaf. It is not a \nprecondition that it be an obligatory one. Any tawaf is enough \naccording to Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) and that is \nwhat Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi alaihi) understood from the \nMudawwana, but is preferred, Shaikh Zarruq (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the famous position is that it is a precondition \nthat it is obligatory like the Tawaf al-Ifada and Tawaf of Arrival.  \n \nThen after he finishes the sa'y the time of Standing is near.  \n \n28.6 At Mina  \n \nOn the Day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul Hijja) you go to Mina \nwhere you pray Dhuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib, 'Isha' and Subh  \n \nIt is called Mina because Nabi Ibrahim (alaihi salam) wished \n(tamanna) in that the command to sacrifice his son would be \ntaken from him. It is said that it is because the blood is shed \n(amna) there. It is six miles from Makka. It is recommended to go \nout to it so that when you reach it, the time of prayer will be near. \nIt is recommended to spend the night there. The basis for this is \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it. Imam Ahmad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) prayed five prayers at Mina: Dhuhr and Subh and what \nis between them. If someone fails to spend the night there, that is \ndisliked, but he does not owe a sacrifice for it.  \n \n28.7 At 'Arafat  \n \nand then you go to 'Arafat \n  \n28.7a Its time  \n \nWhen you have prayed Subh on the ninth day at Mina, it is \nrecommended not to leave it until after sunrise. Then you go to \n'Arafat, which is the place of standing. When you reach 'Arafat, it \nis recommended that the camp at Namira, which is at the end of \nthe Haram and the beginning of the non-Haram.  \n \n28.7b Leading up to the Standing  \n \nDuring this time you continue to recite the talbiya ceasing \nwhen the sun has passed its zenith on the Day of 'Arafat \nand you have reached the place of prayer there. You \nshould have a ghusl before going off to do the prayer on \n'Arafat  \n \nFrom the time you leave from sunrise you continue talbiya. The \nplace of prayer is the masjid of Namira. You should perform a \nghusl after midday before going out. You do not rub thoroughly in \nthe ghusl, but only pass the hands over. This is the last of three \nghusls of hajj. It is for standing, not for prayer, and the woman \nwho is menstruating or in lochia should do it as well.  \n \n28.7c Joining Dhuhr and 'Asr  \n \nwhere you join Dhuhr and 'Asr with the Imam \n  \nThey are joined and shortened. He adds in the Mudawwana, with \ntwo adhans and two iqamas and recitation is silent, not aloud, \neven if it coincides with Jumu'a because he is praying Dhuhr and \nnot Jumu'a. If someone misses joining with the Imam, he joins the \nprayers wherever he is. Shortening at 'Arafa is for the Sunnah.  \n \n28.7d The standing  \n \nThen you accompany him to the standing place at 'Arafat \nand stay there with him till the sun has set \n  \nThis shows that the Standing of 'Arafa is not its prayer place. It is \nvalid to stand in every part of it although it is recommended to \nstand at the large boulders lying at the base of the Mount of \nMercy, the mountain in the middle of 'Arafat. That because it is \nwhere the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) stood. The \nstanding begins after midday.  \n \nHe stands with him until sunset according to what Shaikh al-\nFakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others said and others which \nwould not include any part of the night. The School is that it must \ninclude a part of the night. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"The minimum obligation in the pillar of standing is \nto be present part of the night in a part of 'Arafa wherever he \nwishes except for the bottom of 'Uruna. In short, the fiqh is that \nstanding at 'Arafa after midday is obligatory which can be \nremedied by sacrifice. The standing part of the pillar is a part of \nthe night after sunset. What is considered as standing is the most \nperfect meaning. If he passes through 'Arafat at night and does \nnot stand, that is adequate with two conditions: he knows that \nthis place is 'Arafa and that he intends to be present at 'Arafa. \nThis does not include the one who passes not knowing that this \nplace is 'Arafa. It is recommended to stay there mounted since the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did that. It is recommended \nto glorify and praise Allah azza wa jall, say the shahadah and the \nprayer on Sayyidina Muhammad (alaihi salat wa salam), and \nmake supplication. It is recommended to not fast so as to be strong \nin worship.  \n \n28.8 At Muzdalifa  \n \n28.8a Going to Muzdalifa  \n \nThen when he moves off to go to Muzdalifa you go after \nhim, praying Maghrib, 'Isha and Subh with him at \nMuzdalifa \n  \nAfter sunset on the day of 'Arafa when the night is well advanced, \nyou set out with the Imam for Muzdalifa. If you go before him \nafter sunset, then you abandon the best course. When you arrive \nthere, the first concern is to perform the prayer shortly after \nstopping. You pray the prayers with the Imam at Muzdalifa joined \nand shortened, except for the people of Muzdalifa. The School is \nthat this joining is Sunnah. When dawn comes, it is recommended \nfor him to pray Subh with the Imam at the beginning of the time. \nSo it is recommended to spend the night at Muzdalifa, as is stated \nin the Mukhtasar. Dismounting is obligatory. It is not enough to \nmake the camel kneel: you must dismount. Whoever fails to \ndismount without excuse until dawn owes a sacrifice. Whoever \nomits it for an excuse owes nothing.  \n \n28.8b Standing at Mash'ar al-Haram  \n \nAfter that you stand there with him at the Mash'ar al-\nHaram  \n \nIt is recommended in the well-known school to stop with him \nfacing the House. Mash'ar is a mountain at Muzdalifa. It is called \nthat because in the Jahiliyya they used to mark their sacrifices \nthere. This is the day of Sacrifice. He prays Subh or stops at \nMuzdalifa until the sun has risen.  \n \n28.9 Back to Mina  \n \n28.9a Crossing Muhassir  \n \nand shortly after sunrise, you go to Mina hurrying your \nmount across the Valley of Muhassir \n  \nIts apparent meaning, as the Mukhtasar, is that it is permitted to \ncontinue standing at the Mash'ar until the whitening of the sun. \nIn the Mudawwana, no one stays at the Mash'ar until sunrise or \nwhitening, but moves on before that. The Sahih indicates the first. \nIt says that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \"came to the \nMash'ar al-Haram, faced qibla and praised Allah azza wa jall, \nproclaimed Him great, unified Him and prayed to Him. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) remained standing until it was very bright.\" The \none riding is recommended to make his mount hurry. Muhassir is \na valley between Muzdalifa and Mina. The path is between them. \nIf he is walking, he walks quickly. A woman does not hurry. This \nhurrying is an act of devotion.  \n \n28.9b Stoning the Jamrat al-'Aqaba  \n \nWhen you get to Mina you stone the Jamrat al-'Aqaba using \nseven small pebbles  \n \ni.e. you begin to stone them first when you reach Mina in \nwhatever state you are, riding or otherwise. It is the end of Mina \non the Makkan side. It is called Jamra from the name of what is \nthrown at it: stones. Stoning is done from dawn to sunset on the \nDay of Sacrifice and the time of making it up covers all of the days \nof sacrifice. Indeed, the night after every day is for making up for \nthat day. There is no disagreement that sacrifice is obliged for \nmissing it. Missing it occurs at sunset of the fourth of the days of \nMina. They disagree about its obligation whether the hajj is \ninvalidated by missing any of the jamras.  \n \nStoning has preconditions for its validity. One of the preconditions \nof validity is that he puts the stone between his thumb and \nforefinger. It is said that he holds it with his thumb and middle \nfinger. They are thrown one after the other, Less than that is not \nadequate, even if he throws seven pebbles at once reckoning each \nof them to be one of the stones he throws. Mud is not acceptable \nnor are minerals like iron. There is disagreement about the size of \nwhat is thrown. That which most Shaikhs (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsay is that it is like a date stone. The very small, like gravel is not \nenough.  \n \n28.9c What is said during the stoning  \n \nand saying \"Allahu Akbar\" with each pebble as you throw it \n  \nThis is recommended. If he does not say that takbir, the stoning is \nenough, and he continues to throw the pebbles. It is disliked for \nhim to take a stone and break it and to make pebbles. It is \ndesirable to pick them up from the earth and that they be pure. \nThe stoning should be from the bottom of the valley, Stoning the \nJamra al-'Aqaba makes everything lawful except women and \nhunting. It is called the lesser coming out of ihram. The Tawaf al-\nIfada makes everything lawful for him, even women and hunting. \nIt is called the greater coming out of ihram.  \n \n28.9d Sacrifice  \n \nThen, if you have a sacrificial animal with you, you make \nsacrifice \n  \nHe stands with it at 'Arafa and Mina. All are places for sacrifice \nexcept what is beyond the Jamra al-'Aqaba and the Imam does not \nwait there since the „Id prayer is not there.  \n \n28.9e Shaving the head  \n \nThen you shave your head  \n \nAfter the sacrifice. Or you can shorten it if a man's hair is not \nmatted or plaited. If it is matted or plaited, then it is shaved. \nShaving is only obliged in those two cases. The entire head must \nbe shaved. Doing part of it is like not doing it. If someone has \nsomething wrong with his head so that he cannot shave, he \nsacrifices. As for the woman, the Sunnah for her is to shorten her \nhair.  \n \n28.10 Back to Makka  \n \nAfter that you go the House and do Tawaf al-Ifada going \nround seven times and finishing with the prayer \n  \nIt is the last of the four pillars of hajj which is not mended by \nsacrifice and by it all that was forbidden becomes allowed, even \nwomen and hunting. Taken from his words is that it is better to go \nto do it soon on the Day of Sacrifice. That is indeed the case. But if \nyou delay it past the days of tashriq, sacrifice is not obliged. \nSacrifice is obliged if you leave it until Dhu'l-Hijja is over in the \nfamous position. A counter statement is that if he delays it to the \n11th, then he is obliged to sacrifice. The explanation of \"going \naround\" is that he does not hurry in this tawaf or do sa'y because \nhe did sa'y after the Tawaf of Arrival. This in respect of the one \nwho is not pressed for time. As for the one who was pressed for \ntime so that it was not feasible for him to do the Tawaf of Arrival, \nit is desirable that he trots in the Tawaf of Ifada  \n  \n \n28.11 Back to Mina  \n \n28.11a Staying for three days  \n \nYou then stay for three days at Mina \n  \nThree days and nights if he is not in a hurry. If he omits most of \nthe nights, he is obliged to sacrifice. Shortening of the prayer is \nnot prescribed.  \n \n28.11b Stoning the jamras  \n \nOn each day after the sun has passed the zenith, you first \nstone the jamra nearest Mina using seven small pebbles \nand saying, 'Allahu Akbar' with each pebble thrown. You \nthen stone the other two jamras with the same number of \npebbles again saying \"Allahu Akbar\" as you throw each \none. After stoning the first two jamras you stand and make \ndu'a but after stoning the jamra al-Aqaba you do not stand \nbut move straight off \n  \nOn these three days. He does the middle one second and finishes \nwith the third, which is the Jamra al-'Aqaba, using seven stones \neach time. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \n\"after the zenith\" means before the prayer. If he stones before the \nzenith, it is not enough and he repeats it after midday, as when he \nstones the Jamra al-'Aqaba before Fajr.  \n \n28.11c Leaving for Makka  \n \nWhen you have finished stoning on the third day, making \nfour days including the ‘Id, you leave for Makka  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that he does not stay \nat Mina after stoning on the third day. It is recommended to stop \nat Muhassab and pray Dhuhr, 'Asr, Maghrib and 'Isha' there and \nto enter Makka at night since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did that as the Companions after him. If he prays Dhuhr \nbefore it, he owes nothing, and if he does not stop, he does not \nhave to sacrifice anything.  \n \n28.11d The completion of the hajj  \n \nand your hajj is complete \n  \nIf he means by complete the sunan, obligations and excellent \nparts, there still remains the Tawaf of Farewell. If he means the \nobligations, they are complete before that. He must mean its \nobligations and sunan and so he did not consider the Tawaf of \nFarewell because it is not particular to the hajj. It is done by \nwhoever leaves Makka after the hajj or any other reason.  \n \n28.11e Hurrying up departure from Mina  \n \nIf you want, you can speed up your departure by staying \nonly two days at Mina, leaving after finishing stoning on \nthe second day \n  \nThis is when the sun has not set on the second day. When it sets, \nthere is no hurrying because the night obliges camping there for \nthe stoning of the day. If the sun has set, it is as he is obliged to do \nthe third day.  \n \n28.12 Leaving Makka  \n \nWhen you are about to leave Makka you do the Tawaf of \nFarewell and the two rak’ats after it and then leave \n  \nThis tawaf is recommended and sacrifice is owed for omitting it. \nWhen he finishes it, he prays two rak'ats. Shaikh ibn Farhun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the Tawaf of Farewell has two \nrak'ats and if he omits them until he is far away or arrives home, \nhe prays them then and owes nothing. If he is near and still in a \nstate of purity, he returns to them. If he has broken wudu', he \npurifies himself and begins the tawaf again and then prays them.  \n \n28.13 'Umra  \n \nFor 'umra you do the same as we said at the beginning of \nthis chapter up until when you have completed the sa'y \nbetween Safa and Marwa. You then shave your head and \nyour 'umra is complete \n  \nThis shows that its pillars are three: ihram, tawaf and sa'y. It has \ntwo miqats: time and place. The time is all time, and the place is \noutside the Haram, whether he is foreign or resident in Makka. It \nwould appear from his words then that 'umra is not complete until \nhe shaves his head. That is not the case because Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that his 'umra is compete by tawaf and \nsa'y. Shaving is one of the preconditions of perfection, not one of \nvalidity, and so that is no contradiction in its being mandatory. \nWhat he meant by the end of the 'umra is its perfection and so \nthere is no contradiction.  \n \n28.14 Cutting the hair  \n \n28.14a For men  \n \nFor both hajj and 'umra it is better to shave your head but \nshortening the hair is acceptable in which case the hair \nshould be shortened all over the head \n  \nThis is not absolute: shortening is preferable in the tamattu' hajj \nso that the dishevelment remains for hajj. Shaikh Zarruq \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) stated that. The practice of shaving is only \ncomplete by shaving the entire head since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did that. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that the Sunnah in shortening for men is to cut close \nto the roots. The minimum is to cut off something from all the \nhair. It is not enough cut some of all the hair, even the amount of \na finger. If he shortens only some, he misses the Sunnah.  \n \n28.14b For women  \n \nThe Sunnah for women is to shorten the hair \n  \nIt is disliked for her to shave and it is said that it is haram \nbecause it is mutilation. She shortens her hair. The basis for that \nis what Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Women do not have to \nshave. Women shorten their hair.\"  \n \n28.15 Requirements of Ihram  \n \n28.15a Killing harmful animals  \n \nThere is no harm in someone in ihram killing a rat, snake, \nscorpion or such like nor in killing a dangerous dog or any \nother dangerous animal such as a jackal or a lion \n  \nIt is permitted to kill these categories. Similar to rats are \ncreatures which chew clothes, like weasels. Snakes and vipers \nincludes hornets. A dangerous dog is one which will attack. \nDangerous animals include hyenas and tigers.  \n \n28.15b Killing harmful birds  \n \nYou can also kill crows and kites if you fear they will harm \nyou but not any other birds. You can kill birds whose harm \nis feared, like crows and kites \n  \nThese two types are killed, even if they do not initiate harm, large \nor small. Other birds, harmful or not, are not killed. That is one of \ntwo statements which Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nreported. What is preferred of the two is to kill them if they cause \nharm.  \n \n28.15c Avoiding women  \n \nWhen doing hajj or 'umra you should avoid women  \n \nThis is an obligation. Avoiding women means avoiding enjoyment \nof them by intercourse or anything else. That is obligatory since it \nabsolutely invalidates the hajj, whether it is genital or anal, \nhuman or not, intentional, out of forgetfulness of ignorance, with \nejaculation or not, whether it obliges the hadd or mahr or not, \nwith an adult or not. It is clear from what they say, as in al-\nAhjuri, even if ghusl is not obliged.  \n \nThe second Sunnah that he assumes ihram for making up hajj. \nThat does not spare him the missed one and its ihram. The second \nis ineffectual which has no place while he is in a false ihram and \nhis ihram is not for making it up. He is obliged to complete it \nwhen he has done the Standing in the year in which he corrupted \nit. If he does not catch it, then he is commanded to come out of it \nby doing 'umra He is not permitted to remain in ihram by \nagreement because it is continuing the corrupted while he is able \nto be free of it.  \n \nAs for actions which precede intercourse, like the kiss and the \nembrace, they are unlawful. If he kisses or embraces and has \nejaculated, it is invalidated. Otherwise he should sacrifice a camel. \nAs for the look and the thought, they do not entail invalidation by \nthe emission of sperm because of them unless both of them were \nfor pleasure and continued. As for its emission by simply looking \nor the thought, there is only sacrifice for it. These are the \njudgments for the emission of sperm. It obliges a sacrifice \nabsolutely whether it emerges after constantly looking, thought, \nkiss or touch or not.  \n \n28.15d Avoiding perfume  \n \nperfume \n  \nHe must avoid perfume in hajj or 'umra like rose or jasmine, for \nwhich there is no fidyat, or feminine perfume, which is what has a \nsubstance which stays on the body and clothes, like musk, and \nsaffron. There is fidya for it, even if it is quickly removed.  \n \n28.15e Avoiding stitched clothing \n  \nstitched clothing \n  \nThere is no disagreement that they are unlawful for men but not \nwomen. What is meant is all that surrounds the body or part of it. \nIt is also unlawful for him to wear turbans, trousers and \nburnooses.  \n \n28.15f Avoiding hunting  \n \nhunting \n  \nHe must also avoid hunting in land, whether the reason for \nhunting is to eat meat like the antelope, and wild ass or not, like \nmonkeys without difference between them being tame or wild, \nowned or permitted. There is no exception for that except what is \ntransmitted in the hadith: the kite and crow, rate, scorpion, and \ndangerous dogs.  \n \n28.15g Killing insects  \n \nkilling insects  \n \nHe does not kill lice or remove them from his body.  \n \n28.15h Removing hair from the body  \n \nand removing any hair from your body \n  \nLike clipping the mustache which resembles removing hair. If he \nremoves any of his hair, he owes a handful of grain.  \n \n28.15i Not covering the head  \n \nWhen you are in ihram, you should not cover your head \nnor should you shave it except in a case of necessity \n  \nIt is forbidden for the one in ihram to cover his head and face with \nany covering, be it like mud, let alone a turban. As for other things \nwhich cover the body, it is forbidden to cover with something \nspecific which is stitched. The head is not shaved by the words of \nthe Almighty, \"But do not shave your heads until the sacrificial \nanimal has reached the place of sacrifice. If any of you are ill or \nhave a head injury, there is an expiation\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:196) \nwhich means: shaving to remove harm, and so the fidya is fasting, \nsadaqa, or practices: He indicates this:  \n \n28.15j Its expiation  \n \nIf you do you must make expiation by fasting three days or \nfeeding six destitute people with two mudds each, using \nthe mudd of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) or \nsacrificing a sheep. This sacrifice does not have to be \ncarried out in any particular place \n  \nThis could even be three days at Mina. He must perform an act of \ndevotion. It could be a sheep or something else. He only mentioned \nsheep because fidya is done the best meat. It must be slaughtered. \nIt is not enough to give it without sacrificing it, as some of them \nsaid. The lack of particular place is qualified to when the animal \nwas not garlanded or marked. If it was garlanded or marked, then \nhe only sacrifices it at Mina.  \n \n28.15k What women wear  \n \nWomen may wear khuffs and ordinary clothing while they \nare in ihram but in all other respects they must avoid the \nsame things as men \n  \nThey can absolutely wear leather socks, even if she has sandals. \nThey wear stitched clothes in ihram. Outside of this, they avoid \nthe same things: intercourse and foreplay, hunting, killing \nanimals, removing hair. There is no way she can avoid covering \nher head.  \n \n28.15l A woman's ihram  \n \nA woman's ihram consists in her not covering her face and \nhands  \n \nShe shows her face and hands, and it is forbidden for her to cover \nthem with anything, even mud. She cannot wear a veil. If she does \nany of this, she must do fidya.  \n \n28.15m A man's ihram  \n \nand man's ihram in his not covering his face and head \n  \nA man must show his face and head while in ihram, night and \nday. If he covers any of that and benefits, that is forbidden for him \nand he does fidya whether it is out of forgetfulness, knowingly or \nout of ignorance. If he removes it immediately, he owes nothing. \nHe is permitted to use a pillow and shield himself from the sun or \nwind with his hand. The hand is not considered a covering unless \nit is touching the head and for a long time. In such case he must \ndo fidya as it says the 'Utibiyya. He is permitted to carry his \nbaggage and other things on his head as necessary, like a bundle \nof firewood which he carries to sell. If he carries it for someone \nelse or for trade, there is fidya. He is permitted to seek the shade \nof the buildings and tents.  \n \n28.15n Wearing leather socks  \n \nA man may not wear khuffs while he is in ihram unless he \nhas not got any thronged sandals in which case he should \ncut his khuffs down to below the ankles \n  \nAs is reported in the hadith. Then he proceeds to clarify which \ntype of hajj is best:  \n \n28.16 Ifrad is best  \n \nAccording to us doing Hajj by itself is better than doing \n('umra then hajj separately in the same season) or (hajj and \n'umra together)  \n \nIfrad is best based on what is in the two Sahih collections that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did ifrad in the Farewell Hajj \nand that continued to be the action of the khalifs. Abu Bakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) did ifrad in 2 AH, 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nin 10 AH and Uthman (rahmatullahi alaihi) in 12. It has not been \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) did qiran \nor tamattu'. The Imam said that some of the Companions \ncommanded qiran and some tamattu'. Ifrad does not need to be \nmended by sacrifice as opposed to qiran and tamattu'. They need \nthat.  \n \n28.16a Someone not from Makka not doing ifrad  \n \nIf someone who is not from Makka does qiran or tamattu'  \n \nIt is understood that the people of Makka do not have to sacrifice. \nWhat is meant by them are those who are present there or at Dhu \nTuwa at the time the practices are performed. There are two \nconditions for the sacrifice of the one doing qiran: that he does not \nlive in Makka or Dhu Tuwa and that he makes hajj in the same \nyear. If he misses the hajj, he comes out of 'umra and owes no \nsacrifice. If he omits the first and does not come out of ihram for \n'umra and remains in ihram, it is not canceled for him. Then he \nclarifies the place of the sacrifice.  \n \n28.16b The sacrifice to mend it at Mina  \n \nhe must sacrifice an animal at Mina \n  \nAt Mina in the day after Fajr. It is not enough to do it as night. \nThe basis in all that is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did it. There are preconditions for the validity of the \nsacrifice:  \n \n28.16c Preconditions for the validity of the sacrifice  \n \nwhich he had with him at 'Arafa \n  \n1. Whoever is obliged to sacrifice must have the animals at 'Arafa \nat night. Shaikh ibn Harun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"As for the \nprecondition of standing at night, I do not know of any dispute \nabout it because all who stipulate standing at 'Arafa at night, like \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), make its judgment that of its \nowner in what makes the standing acceptable.  \n \n2. The sacrifice must be during the days of Mina: the Day of \nSacrifice and the two days after it The fourth day is not included. \n  \n3. If the sacrifice is in the hajj, the sacrifice was driven under the \nihram of the hajj, whether it was obliged by something lacking, or \nin the 'umra, or voluntary to repay hunting.  \n \nWhen all these preconditions exist, is it not permitted to sacrifice \nat Makka or anywhere else: the sacrifice at Mina is obligatory. If \nhe lacks some of the preconditions, it is permitted for him.  \n \n28.16d Sacrifice at Marwa  \n \nIf he did not have it at 'Arafa he should sacrifice it in \nMakka at Marwa, having brought it there from outside the \nHaram  \n \nIf he missed it in the days of Mina, even if he stood at 'Arafa, then \nhe is obliged to sacrifice in Makka or the houses near it. He is not \nallowed to sacrifice at Dhu Tuwa and other places outside Makka, \neven if they are connected to the houses of Makka. That is only \nwhen he has brought the sacrifice from outside the Haram by any \naspect because every sacrifice must combine Haram and non-\nHaram. The sacrifice can be sheep, cattle or camels, but camels \nare best. Only sound animals are allowed in all like the sacrifices \nand sacrifice of these three is specified for the one doing tamattu' \nand qiran when he can do so.  \n \n28.16e Fasting three days on the hajj  \n \nIf you do not have a sacrificial animal you should fast \nthree days during the hajj, that being between the time \nyou go into ihram and the Day of 'Arafa \n  \nHe only mentions the tamattu' and not the qiran. The three days \nduring the hajj can be from the time of ihram to the day of 'Arafa. \nSo if the imperfection which obliges sacrifice is before standing at \n'Arafa, it is included in the time of fasting for three days, which is \nfrom ihram to 'Arafa because he can fast. He is like the one who \nexceeds the miqat and does tammatu' and qiran and omits the \nTawaf of Arrival. We said, 'before the standing' is if the \nimperfection occurs after standing, like not stopping in Muzdalifa, \nor not stoning or shaving, or delaying the three until the days of \ntashriq are over. Then he fasts them with the seven days when he \nwishes.  \n \n28.16f Fasting the days of Mina  \n \nIf you do not manage to do that you fast the days of Mina. \nThen when you return to your own country you fast seven \nmore days  \n \nIf he misses the three days in the hajj, he fasts them at Mina \nwithout incurring any sin if he delays the fast until then for an \nexcuse. After fasting the three, whether in the hajj or at Mina, he \nfasts the seven when he returns from Mina to Makka, whether he \nstays at Makka or not. If he delays it, he fasts whenever he \nwishes, and it is recommended that the three be consecutive, but \nit is not obligatory. The same applies to the ten. It is \nrecommended in the well-known position.  \n \n28.17 Tamattu'  \n \n28.17a How it is done  \n \nTo do tamattu', you go into ihram for 'umra only during the \nmonths of hajj, then come out of ihram, then go back into it \nagain for hajj that same year without having traveled back \nto your country or to anywhere else a similar distance \naway \n  \nIt is not a precondition that they are both in the months of hajj. If \nhe goes into ihram in Ramadan and then completes it in Shawwal, \nhe does tamattu' even if a pillar falls into the months of hajj. If \nonly shaving remains for him and it happens in the months of \nhajj, he is not doing tamattu'. Then he performs hajj in this year \nbecause if they were not both in the same year, there is no \ntamattu'. He is also not doing tamattu' if he returns to his land \nafter his 'umra in the months of hajj before going into ihram for \nhajj. So tamattu' is true in any form when he finishes 'umra in the \nmonths of hajj and goes into ihram for hajj before he returns to his \nland.  \n \n28.17b Coming out of 'umra and going into ihram for hajj  \n \nIf this is the case you are permitted to go back into ihram \nfrom Makka if that is where you are but to do you must go \noutside the haram territory \n  \nWhen he comes out of 'umra, he goes into ihram in Makka. In this \ncase it is recommended that he do it from the door of the masjid. \nHe does not go into ihram from Makka because one of the \npreconditions of 'umra is that he combine being in and out of \nihram.  \n \n28.18 Qiran  \n \nTo do qiran you go into ihram for hajj and 'umra together, \nmaking the intention to do 'umra first. If you decide to do \nHajj as well as 'umra before you have done the tawaf and \nits following two rak’ats you are considered as doing qiran \n  \nHe begins with 'umra. It appears from his words that he does not \nmake it consecutive in tawaf. The well-known position is that it is \npermitted. It is valid after he completes it and before praying the \nrak'ats, but it is disliked. If he prays the rak'ats, he misses \nconsecutiveness. Whoever does it consecutively (arfada) after sa'y \nis not doing qiran by agreement.  \n \n28.19 Particulars on tamattu' and qiran  \n \n28.19a People of Makka doing tamattu' or qiran  \n \nThe people of Makka do not have to sacrifice if they are \ndoing tamattu' or qiran \n  \nIt is agreed that they do not have to sacrifice in tamattu' or qiran \naccording to the well-known position.  \n \n28.19b When it is not tamattu'  \n \nIf you come out of ihram after an 'umra before the months \nof hajj and then stay on for hajj during the same year, you \nare not considered as doing tamattu'  \n \nIf he delays the shaving until the months of hajj.  \n \n28.20 Atonement for hunting in ihram  \n \n28.20a Expiation  \n \nIf you kill any game while in ihram you have to make \nexpiation for it by sacrificing a domestic animal equivalent \nto the one you killed \n  \nWhether its flesh is eaten or not. The Lawgiver said whether the \nkiller in ihram is doing hajj or 'umra, or is in the Haram, even if \nhe is not a muhrim, whether he is free or slave, male or female, \nyoung or old, and the killing is deliberate or accidental, or by \nforgetfulness direct or causal. This sacrifice is an obligation. The \nlikeness is in form and value, or close to it. So the one who kills an \nelephant owes a Khurassan camel with two humps. The one who \nkills a wild ox or wild ass or gazelle owes a domestic cow. The one \nwho kills an ostrich owes a camel because it is close in value and \nform. The one who kills a hyena, fox, or one of the doves of Makka \noutside the Haram must pay its price in food when it is killed. The \nleast of what is allowed in repayment for hunting is a lamb or kid \nbecause Allah azza wa jall called it a sacrifice and so it must meet \nthe preconditions of a sacrifice.  \n \n28.20b Who assesses it  \n \nThis should be ascertained by two trustworthy fuqaha' \nfrom among the Muslims \n  \nIf he pays it before their judgment on it, he repeats it, even if the \nevaluated thing is not eaten. The precondition of being \ntrustworthy is being free and adult. There must be the expression \n\"judgment\": fatwa is not enough. One of the preconditions of their \njudgment is that base their judgment on the judgment of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) and the Companions. A judgment \nwhich has no prior judgment is rejected and not carried out; and \nno one repays without a judgment. If he repays it without a \njudgment, he repeats it, even if it agrees with the judgment \npassed. An exception to are the doves of Makka and the Haram for \nwhich there is a sheep.  \n \n28.20c Where the sacrifice is done  \n \nIf the animals to be killed was with you on 'Arafa the \nsacrifice should be made at Mina. Otherwise it should be \nmade in Makka, the animal concerned having been \nbrought in from outside the Haram territory \n  \nThe place where it is slaughtered, i.e. the repayment of game if it \nis part of what is slaughtered and sacrificed. He or his \nrepresentative do it at Mina. Otherwise it is done in Makka.  \n \n28.20d The choice \n \nYou have the choice of doing this or of making kaffarah by \nfeeding destitute people, in which case you work out the \nvalue of the animal killed in terms of food and give that \namount away as sadaqa. Or alternatively you can fast one \nday for each mudd, fasting a whole day for any incomplete \nmudd \n  \nSomeone who kills game has a choice between two things. He can \ndo kaffarah, which is feeding from the predominant food of the \nplace where the game was killed, whatever it is. If it has no value \nthere, one considers its price in the nearest place to it, and he \ngives it as sadaqa to them. When he feeds, each poor person \nreceives a mudd. If he gives its price or goods, that is not enough.  \n \nThe second possibility is to fast. There is a day per mudd because \nhe cannot make it partial, and so it can only be mended by a \ncomplete day.  \n \n28.21 Going home  \n \n28.21a The ruling of 'umra  \n \n'Umra is a confirmed Sunnah to be done at least once in a \nlifetime \n  \nIt as two miqats: place, which are those of the hajj, and time, \nwhich is the entire year. It has three pillars: ihram, tawaf and \nsa'y. Shaving is not one of its pillars. The description of ihram for \nit is recommended to have a ghusl and what is permitted to dress \nand what is forbidden of scent, etc., is like the hajj. It is disliked to \nrepeat it in the same year in the well-known position.  \n \n28.21b Final du'a  \n \nWhen you leave Makka after hajj or 'umra, it is \nrecommended \nto \nsay: \n\"Ayibuna, \nta-ibuna, \n'abidana \nlirabbina, hamiduna, sadaqa'llahu wa'dahu wa nasara \n'abdahu \nwa \nhazama'l-Ahzaba \nwahdah. \n(Returning, \nrepentant, worshipping, praising our Lord. Allah had been \ntrue to His promise and given victory to His slave and \ndefeated the clans by Himself.)  \n \n \n \nChapter 29: On sacrifices, (animals sacrificed \nfor the birth of a child), , and drinks \n \n \n29.1 Animals for feast day and hajj sacrifices  \n \n29.1a The ruling of the ‘Id sacrifice  \n \nSacrificing an animal for the ‘Id is a Sunnah which is \nobligatory for all who are able to do so \n  \nAdhiya refers to animals which are brought to be sacrificed on the \nDay of al-Adha and afterwards. It is called that because of the day \nwhen they are sacrificed at Duha and it is called the „Id al-Adha \nbecause the prayer in it is at that time. It is a confirmed Sunnah \nin the well-known position for the one who is able, if he is free, \nMuslim, adult or child, male or female, resident or traveling, not \non hajj, because the Sunnah is for him to sacrifice for himself and \nthose relatives whose maintenance he is responsible for, like \nparents and poor children. By \"being able\" he avoids the one who \nis poor. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \none who is able is the one who would be injured in his property, \ni.e. the one who is not able to find its price in that year. \nPartnership is permitted in the reward for it rather than in its \nprice.  \n \n29.1b The minimum  \n \nThe least which is acceptable for it in the case of sheep is a \njadha, which is a one year old ram, although some have \nsaid eight months and some ten months old. In the case of \ngoats it should be a thaniyya, which means a male in its \nsecond year and likewise only thaniyya animals are \nacceptable in the case of cattle and camels. A thaniyya in \nrespect to cattle is a male in its fourth year and in respect \nto camels it is a six year old male \n  \nThis is the well-known position.  \n \n29.1c The most perfect animal  \n \nRams which have not been castrated are better for \nsacrifice than those which have been, but castrated rams \nare better than ewes. Ewes are better than either male or \nfemale goats. Male goats which have not been castrated are \nbetter than camels and cattle for ‘Id sacrifices \n  \nThis has to do with being more perfect. So there are twelve grades, \nthe highest is a uncastrated ram and the least is a female camel \nand cow.  \n \n29.1d The order in animals  \n \nAs regards 'hadys' (animals to be sacrificed as part of the \nhajj) camels are best and then cattle and then sheep and \nthen goats  \n \nThis is the famous position because what is desired of hadys is to \nhave a lot of meat for the poor, and what is desired of the dahiya is \ngood meat, i.e. for bringing to the family, Shaikh Bahram \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The evidence for us in the two places \nis that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to often \nmake his hadys camels and his dahiya was two rams, as is \nreported in the Sahih.  \n \n29.1e Unacceptable animals  \n \nIn none of these circumstances is it acceptable to sacrifice \na one-eyed animal or a sick animal or a markedly lame \nanimal or an emaciated animal  \n \nHowever, an animal with some whiteness in the eye which does \nnot entail blindness is permitted. Of course, a totally blind animal \nis not permitted. A clearly ill animal is not allowed, but one with a \nslight illness is permitted. Clear illness involves not eating \nnormally or eating a lot. Also excluded are animals having a lot \nmange and which have lost its teeth, except for a single tooth.  \n \n29.1f Other unacceptable animals  \n \nIn fact you should avoid using for sacrifice any animal \nwhich has something wrong with it. You should also avoid \nany split-eared animal unless the split is only slight. The \nsame applies to an animal whose ear has been cut off or \none with a broken horn. If it is bleeding it is not acceptable \nfor sacrifice. However, if it is not bleeding, it is acceptable \n  \nThis is if it is a lot, a little is overlooked. He includes split-eared \nanimals, and other forms of mangling the ears. There is \ndisagreement about the extent of cutting, That which is the \npredominant position is that a third of the ear is slight, and a \nthird of the tail is a lot because the tail is meat and sinew while \nthe ear is not. This is about the tail of the sheep which is a fat tail. \nAs for like the ox, camel and sheep in some lands which have no \nmeat on the tail, that which would prevent its acceptability is \nwhat decrease beauty. Bleeding refers to a wound which does not \nheal.  \n \n29.2 Time of Sacrifice  \n \n29.2a After the Imam  \n \nIt is good to sacrifice your animal yourself after the Imam \nhas made his sacrifice on the morning of the Day of \nSacrifice. If you slaughter your animal before the Imam \nyou must repeat your sacrifice \n  \nThat is recommended if it is possible to imitate the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam). If you cannot do that for some reason, \nthen you delegates Muslim, and it is recommended that he be one \nof the people of virtue and excellence. Anyone who does not pray is \ndisliked, but it is said that it is permitted in the well-known \nposition. It is not allowed to delegate an unbeliever of any \ndescription.  \n \nThe time of sacrifice begins from the time the Imam sacrifices on \nthe Day of Sacrifice, the 10th of Dhu'l-Hijja. He should sacrifice in \nthe morning, which is the time of the nafila. If anyone sacrifices \nbefore the Day of Sacrifice or after Fajr on the Day of Sacrifice and \nbefore sunrise, that is not permitted and he must repeat the \nsacrifice. This is based on the words of the Almighty, \"Do not \nadvance yourselves in front of Allah and of His Messenger.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 49:1) Shaikh al-Hasan al-Basri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"It was sent down about people who sacrificed before the Imam.\" \nThis is about the one who has an Imam.  \n \n29.2b When there is no Imam  \n \nIf there is no Imam with you, you should make sure you do \nnot do it before the time the Imam nearest to you would do \nso. The sacrifice must not be done at night \n  \nThey sacrifice at the proper time. If their error becomes evident to \nthem, it is allowed in the well-known position. One considers the \nImam of the prayer. It is not done at night on the second or third \nday. This is because Allah azza wa jall says, \"Mention Allah's \nName on particular days.\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:28) It is allowed to \nsacrifice in forenoon in the second or third day after dawn and \nbefore sunrise, but then he has abandoned what is recommended \nas opposed to the one who sacrifices in the first day after dawn \nand before sunrise which is not acceptable.  \n \n29.2c The three days of sacrifice  \n \nThere are three 'days of sacrifice' and you can make your \nsacrifice any time up until Maghrib on the last of these \ndays but the best time to make your sacrifice is on the first \nday \n  \nAccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), following a group \nof the Companions. It is the Day of Sacrifice and the two days \nafter it. The end of the time is sunset on the third day. The best \ntime follows what was done by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) and the right-guided khalifs (may Allah azza wa jall bless \nthem all).  \n \n29.2d On the second day  \n \nIf you do not manage to make your sacrifice before midday \non the first day some of the people of knowledge say that it \nis better to wait until the morning of the second day \n  \nThis is Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh Bahram \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \ntransmitted \nit \nfrom \nImam \nMalik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat they is no disagreement that what is done before midday \nfrom the beginning of the day is better than what is after it. There \nis disagreement about whether what is after midday of it is better \nthan before midday of the second day. That is the apparent \nmeaning of what the Mukhtasar says. It is the school of the \nRisala. The reliable position is that all of the first day is better \nthan what is after it.  \n \n29.2e None of the animal can be sold  \n \nNo part of an animal sacrificed for the ‘Id may be sold; \nneither its skin nor anything else \n  \nThis is a prohibition. This also applies to an 'Aqiqa. He refutes the \none who says that its skin can be sold.  \n \n29.3 Ritual of Sacrifice  \n \n29.3a Facing qibla  \n \nThe animal you are intending to sacrifice should be made \nto face the qibla  \n \nThis is in all sacrifices. If it is not done for some excuse or \nforgetfulness, it is agreed that it can be eaten.  \n \n29.3b What is said  \n \nand when you slaughter it you should say, \"Bismillahi, \nAllahu Akbar.\" (In the name of Allah. Allah is greater.)  \n \nHe says both. That is the action of the people. The takbir is \nSunnah, i.e. recommended. The basmala is taken from his (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) words afterwards, and it is the position in the \nMudawwana. It is obligatory when remembered and one is able to \nsay it. It is omitted in case of lack of ability and forgetfulness. If \nhe confines himself to it, that is sufficient by the words of Allah, \n\"Eat from that over which the name of Allah has been mentioned.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 6:118) Nothing is a precondition but the name of \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \n29.3c What is said on ‘Id sacrifices  \n \nIf, when sacrificing for the ‘Id you add \"Rabbana taqabbal \nminnâa (Our Lord, accept this from us), there is no harm in \nthat \n  \nThis means it is recommended. It is also said that it is permission.  \n \n29.3d If the basmala is forgotten  \n \nIf you forget to say 'Bismillah' when sacrificing an animal \nfor the ‘Id or at any other time you are permitted to eat it. \nHowever, if the Bismillah is left out deliberately the animal \ncannot be eaten \n  \nAccording to the position of the Mudawwana, it is obligatory when \nremembered.  \n \n29.3e When hunting  \n \nThe same thing applies to sending hunting animals out \nafter game \n  \nOr shooting an arrow and the like used for hunting. It is eaten. If \nthe basmala is deliberately omitted, it is not eaten by the words of \nAllah, \"Do not eat from that over which the name of Allah has not \nbeen mentioned.\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:121) The Almighty said, \"Eat \nfrom what they bring you and mention the name of Allah over it.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 5:4)  \n \n29.4 Use of animals for various types of sacrifice  \n \n29.4a Not sold, but eaten from and given away  \n \nIt is not permissible to sell the meat, skin, fat, innards, or \nany other part of an animal that has been sacrificed either \nfor the ‘Id or for a new-born child or as part of the Hajj, but \nyou are allowed to eat from such an animal and it is \nrecommended to give some away as sadaqa although it is \nnot obligatory to do this \n  \nThis includes horn, wool and hair. It is possible that the excellence \nis specific or that it refers to combining eating and sadaqa, which \nis the literal meaning by the words of the Almighty, \"Eat from \nthem and feed those who are poor and in need.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n22:28) and His words, \"feed both those who ask and those who are \ntoo shy to ask\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:32) whether he asks or not. Giving \nit all as sadaqa is disliked. There is no definition to how much is \neaten or given away. Most forbid feeding the unbeliever from it \nabsolutely, whether a Kitabi or Magian.  \n \n29.4b Not eating from an animal slaughtered for expiation  \n \nYou may not, however, eat from an animal you have \nsacrificed in expiation for breaking one of conditions of \nihram nor for one sacrificed on account of having killed \nwhile in ihram nor from one sacrificed as part of a vow you \nhave made to feed the poor nor from 'hadys' intended as \nvoluntary sacrifices which for some reason become \ndefective before reaching the place of sacrifice. In any \nother instances you can eat from your sacrifice if you want \n  \nThe hadis are not eaten as opposed to the dhahiya. The place of \nsacrifice is Mina if he had the animal at 'Arafa and it is within the \ndays of sacrifice, and at Makka if he did not stop there or if the \ndays of sacrifice have passed. It is haram to eat from the these \ncategories after they reach their place because Allah azza wa jall \ncalled the fidya and repayment kaffarah, and a man does not eat \nfrom his kaffarah. He excludes himself in the third case and gives \nit to the poor. He is permitted to eat it before the place because he \ncan still replace it. He is permitted to eat from voluntary hadis \nwhen they are defective after reaching the place. He is permitted \nto eat the hadis of qiran and tamattu' and the hadi of invalidation, \nand every hadi obliged for missing one of the marks of hajj \nabsolutely before reaching the place and after it by the lack of \nsuspicion before it reaches the place because he can replace it, and \nafter it the business is clear.  \n \n29.5 Slaughtering  \n \n29.5a Severing the throat and carotid arteries  \n \nThe correct method of slaughtering is to sever the throat \nand the carotid arteries and nothing short of that is \nacceptable \n  \nAll of the throat. The throat and arteries must all be cut: this is \nthe position of Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and is well-\nknown. It is said that it is enough to cut the arteries completely \nand half the throat. The literal words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) mean that it is not a precondition to cut the gullet. Qadi \n'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the gullet is the path of food \nand drink.  \n \n29.5b A single stroke  \n \nIf you take your hand away after severing only part of that \nand then resume and compete the cutting, the animal \ncannot be eaten \n  \nIt is apparent that it is whether it is a long or short gap, but there \nis disagreement about when he returns the blade quickly. Shaikh \nSahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is unlawful. Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is eaten because all that is \nasked is that it be immediate and a small disparity is over looked. \nThat is the reliable position. The fiqh of the question is that if he \nlifts his hand after killing it and returns afterwards, it is not \neaten, even if he lifted his hand by necessity. If he lifts his hand \nbefore finishing any of the killing, it is eaten, even if he returns \nafterwards because the second is a separate slaughter.  \n \n29.5c Cutting off the head  \n \nIf you cut the head right off you have committed a wrong \naction, but the animal can be eaten \n  \nWhether it is deliberate, by forgetfulness or an overly sharp knife.  \n \n29.5d When the animal is slaughtered from the back of the \nneck  \n \nYou cannot eat an animal which has been slaughtered from \nthe back of the neck \n  \nIt has not be slaughtered in the prescribed manner and its death \narose out by cutting the spine. If it is killed by such slaughtering, \nit is not eaten, even if the throat is cut and the knife is hard on the \narteries because of the lack of sharpness in the knife and it cuts \nthe arteries from inside. It is not eaten according to the Maliki \nSchool.  \n \n29.5e Methods of slaughter  \n \nCattle should be slaughtered with a knife but if their \nthroats are pierced with a spear they can still be eaten \n  \nTwo forms are permitted in cattle because they have the place of \nsacrifice and the place of slaughter. The place of sacrifice is the \nupper breast. It is not a precondition in nahr slaughter that any of \nthe throat and arteries be cut because the place of the upper \nbreast is the place where the implement reaches the heart and the \nanimal dies quickly.  \n \n29.5f Camels  \n \nCamels should be pierced in the throat with a spear and if \nthey are slaughtered with a knife they may not be eaten \nalthough there is a difference of opinion about this \n  \nIt is recommended that camels be slaughtered while they are \nstanding. There is disagreement about eating them if they are \nslaughtered with a knife. The position that they are not eaten if \nthey are slaughtered like this is found in the Mudawwana. Shaikh \nibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes it as a prohibition and \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) thinks it is well-known. \nIt is what is preferred. Others consider it disliked. The dispute is \nabout when such a slaughter is unnecessary. If it is necessary, as \nwhen a camel falls into a hole and its upper chest cannot be \nreached and it is slaughtered, then it can be eaten by agreement.  \n \n29.5g Sheep and goats  \n \nSheep and goats should be slaughtered with a knife and if \ntheir throats are pierced with a spear they should not be \neaten although there is a difference of opinion about this \nalso \n  \nThis is when it is not due to necessity. The well-known position is \nthat it is forbidden. If it is due to necessity, as when it falls into a \nhole and slaughtered, there is agreement that it is eaten.  \n \n29.5h The fetus  \n \nThe slaughter of a mother includes what is in the womb \nprovided that the fetus is fully formed and its hair has \ngrown \n  \nThis is part of livestock. If it is slaughtered and there is dead fetus \nin it, it can be eaten with preconditions. It should be fully \ndeveloped. This does not mean that all its limbs are perfect. It can \nbe even if missing a leg.  \n \n29.6 Forbidden foods and animal by-products  \n \n29.6a Various forms of death  \n \nAn animal which has been strangled by a rope or suchlike \nor one that has been beaten with a stick or some other \nobject or one that has fallen from a height or one that has \nbeen gored or one that has been attacked by a wild beast \nmay not be slaughtered and eaten if the animal is going to \ndie from the wounds it has received \n  \n\"Suchlike\" includes the spear and the stone. This is because such \nanimals are carrion. If it is hoped that the animal will live, there \nis no dispute about sacrificing it. If there is no hope of life, Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said via Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that it is not sacrificed and not eaten. It is the position of \nthe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi). The school of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), which is transmitted from Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi), is that it is sacrificed and eaten. It is \nthe preferred position.  \n \n29.6b Carrion in dire need  \n \nThere is no harm in eating carrion (mayta) if you are in \ndire need  \n  \nFrom any living thing except human. If someone in ihram finds \nboth game and carrion, he eats the carrion. If he finds carrion and \npig, he eats the carrion. If he only finds pig, he eats it. It is \nrecommended to him to slaughter it and its slaughter is by \nwounding. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The \nevident position is that he does not need to slaughter it because \nslaughter does not benefit that which forbidden to eat.  \n \n29.6c How long carrion can be eaten  \n \nyou can eat from it until you are satisfied and take \nprovision from it so long as you throw it away when the \nneed for it no longer exists \n  \nThis is when he fear lack of food in the future. It is permissible for \nthe person compelled to eat carrion when he does not find any \nother food. If he is forced to take food belonging to other people, it \nis said that he confines himself to what is necessary for life \nwithout filling himself and taking provision, as Shaikh al-\nMawwaq (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated. It is said that he eats his \nfill \nand \ndoes \nnot \ntake \nprovision, \nas \nShaikh \nal-Huttab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said. As he is permitted to eat carrion in \nnecessity, he is also allowed to drink all that will repel thirst, like \nimpure water and other impure liquids, like impure rose water \nexcept for wine. It s not lawful except to take a swallow. It is of no \nuse in quenching thirst. Indeed, it increases thirst.  \n \n29.6d Skins of carrion  \n \nThere is no harm in using the skin of a carrion animal if it \nhas been tanned but you cannot pray on it nor can it be \nsold \n  \nBy tanning its smell and moisture is removed. It is understood \nthat it is a precondition that it is not used before it is tanned. It \nappears from his words that the tanning is used for the skins of all \ncarrion as Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said. It is well-known that \ntanning is not used for pigskin. It is also apparent from his words \nthat its purity is general to aquatic and other animals, and that it \nis the case with Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. \nThe well-known position is that its purity is confined to dry \nanimals. Water alone is what clarifies aquatic animals . However \nthe prayer is not performed on that in the well-known position. It \nis not sold according to one of two transmissions which is well-\nknown in the School.  \n \n29.6e Skins of wild animals  \n \nThere is no harm in doing the prayer on skins of wild \nanimals or selling them if they have been killed correctly \n  \nThis means it is permissible. This refers to every animal whose \nflesh is disliked and so it includes elephants, wolves, foxes, and \nhyenas provided that they are slaughtered. They can also be sold.  \n \n29.6f Wool and hair of carrion \n  \nYou can use wool of a carrion animal or its hair or any \nother thing which could be taken from the animal when \nalive, but according to us it is better for it to be washed \nfirst \n  \nAfter shearing and it refers for general use in selling, praying on \nit, giving it as sadaqa and other things. If it is sold, the fact that it \nis from carrion should be made clear. It is clear that his words, \n\"and its hair\" includes the bristles of pigs. That is the case \naccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others. It is said that the hair of \npigs and dogs are excluded and others say that all of pigs are \nimpure except the hair. The Malikis recommend that wool and \nother things be washed if you are not certain that they are pure. If \nyou are certain that something is pure, it is not recommended to \nwash it. If you are certain it is impure, it is obligatory to wash it.  \n \n29.6g Feathers, horns, teeth, hooves, tusks  \n \nYou cannot use feathers from birds which are carrion or \nthe horns, hooves and teeth of carrion animals. It is \ndisliked to use elephant tusks although there is a \ndifference of opinion about this \n  \nThis would appear to contradict his words \"or what is taken from \nthem when alive.\" He removes the specification by his words, \"or \npain them.\" It is clear that it is prohibition because life makes it \nallowed.  \n \nThe dislike of the use of elephant tusks is found in the \nMudawwana. But there is disagreement about it as about horn \nand antlers. There are four positions, and the well-known of them \nis that all of it is impure based. Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that it is pure. What is confirmed is that elephant \ntusks are impure since it is carrion. The position of the \nMudawwana is to dislike oils found in the tusks of elephants, \ncombing with it, and trading in it because it is carrion. As for the \ntusks of elephants slaughtered, even as a camel, that is disliked, \nand the dislike is for encourage restraint.  \n \n29.6h Liquids in which a mouse dies  \n \nAny ghee, oil or liquid honey in which a mouse has died \nshould be thrown away and not eaten although there is no \nharm in using such oil for lighting purposes provided it is \nnot in a masjid, in which case it should be carefully \navoided \n  \nIt is not sold. Similar to a mouse is any breathing creature. \nLiquids are thrown away and not eaten However it can be used for \nlight in places like houses and shops. It is not used in masjids \nbecause it is impure and the masjid lamps are not lit by it since \nthey are free from impurities.  \n \n29.6i If the substance is solid  \n \nIf the substance is solid, then the mouse should be thrown \naway along with what is around it and the rest may be \neaten, although Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthis was the case only if it had not stayed in it a long time, \notherwise all of it should be thrown away \n  \nHe can sell it although he must make that clear. There is no set \namount which is thrown away. That is according to predominant \nopinion. If it is in it a long time, then the impurity may have \nspread throughout it.  \n \n29.6j Food of the People of the Book  \n \nThere is no harm in the food of the people of the Book and \ntheir slaughtered animals \n  \nHe means it is permissible. Allah azza wa jall says, \"And the food \nof those given the Book is lawful to you.\" Most commentators say \nthat what is meant is all slaughtered food is lawful, what is lawful \nof that and what is unlawful, like when the slaughtered animal \nhas a bad lung. There must be permission to eat if the Kitabi is \none of those who does not consider carrion lawful. If he considers \nit lawful, Shaikh al-Bakri (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if is \nslaughtered in your presence and then it is permitted to eat it. If \nhe is absent from it, it is not permitted.  \n \n29.6k Fat of animals slaughtered by Jews  \n \nHowever, it is disliked to eat the fat from animals \nslaughtered by Jews although it is not actually haram \n  \ni.e. what is forbidden them by their Shari‟ah, like the fat of cows \nand sheep like the fine fat which covers the intestines. If it is said \nthat the fat which are the Jews are forbidden by our Shari‟ah is \nnot unlawful, the answer is that it is a slaughtered part and what \nis slaughtered is lawful for him and he did not slaughter for other \nthan what is lawful for him. Because it is prohibited for him it is \ndisliked for us to eat it.  \n \n29.6l Animals slaughtered by Magians  \n \nIt is not permissible to eat animals slaughtered by Magians \nalthough any of their food that does not involve \nslaughtering is not haram \n  \nThis refers to idolater in general, whether an idolater slaughters \nfor himself or for a Muslim unless he commands him to sacrifice \nand tells him, \"Say, 'In the name of Allah' over it'. That can be \neaten without disagreement.  \n \nSimilarly one does not eat the sacrifice of the drunk or mad \nperson, even if they carry out the slaughter, because of the \nabsence of their intellect. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"It is valid when done by the discriminating child, and \nthe woman without necessity in the soundest position.\" It is \npermitted to eat unslaughtered food by agreement if he is certain \nof its purity. If he is certain of its impurity, it is unlawful to eat it. \nIf he doubts it, he considers it impure.  \n \n29.7 Hunting  \n \n29.7a Hunting for sport is disliked  \nHunting for mere pleasure is disliked but any other kind of \nhunting is permissible.  \n \nHunting is obligatory if he can only provide for his family by it.  \n \n29.7b Prey killed by a trained dog or falcon  \n \nAny prey killed by your trained dog or falcon can be eaten \nif you sent it after it \n  \nIt is not particular these two, but applies to all animals which can \nbe trained to hunt and obey. It is not a precondition that falcons \nbe restrained unless the prey is a bird. It is enough that it obey \nwhen released. It is not a precondition that it accept confinement \nafter being released. It is a precondition for hunting animal that \nhe actually train it, even if it is an animal which does not \nnormally accept training, like a lion or tiger. It is a precondition \nthat the prey be seen or in a confined space like a cave or thicket \nwhich he knows about or which has no other exit. Otherwise it is \nnot eaten. It must be something whose flesh is eaten, even if it \ndifferent than he thinks as when he thinks it is a rabbit and \nreleases his dog and it is a gazelle. It is a precondition that the \nhunter make an intention and say the tasmiya when releasing the \nanimal. If he neglects it intentionally, the game is not eaten but \nnot if he forgot and he is Muslim. This is for land hunting. As for \nfishing, it is permitted for everyone who is sane. It is not valid \nfrom a mad person or drunk.  \n \n29.7c Prey killed out of sight \n  \nThe same applies if your hunting animal kills any prey out \nof sight before you are able to slaughter it. If you reached \nthe prey before it has been killed it can only be eaten if you \nslaughter it \n  \nIt must be slaughtered. If he does not neglect it, it is eaten, even if \nhe does not carry out its killing since there must be bloodletting, \neven on the ear when the skin is thick.  \n \n29.7d Killing game with a spear or arrow  \n \nYou can eat anything you kill with a spear or arrow but if \nyou get the chance to slaughter it you should do so \n  \nAll that has a point, even if not iron, whether it is killed outright \nor dies of its wound. You can eat it because of your intention and \nbasmala when you shot. It is desirable to slaughter it if you find it \nstill alive.  \n \n29.7e Game that runs off  \n \nYou can still eat an animal even if it runs off, provided you \nare sure that it is your arrow that has killed it as long as \nyou reach it before nightfall. Some say that this refers only \nto prey that has been killed by trained hunting animals. If \nyour arrow is found piercing a vital organ you can eat the \nanimal \n  \nIt says in the Mudawwana that if the night passes and he finds it \ndead, he does not eat it, whether that is through a dog, falcon or \narrow.  \n \n29.7f Domestic animals killed like game  \n \nYou cannot eat a domestic animal which has been killed in \nthe way game is killed \n  \nThis is clear, even if it is a stray and has joined wild animals. It is \nthe same if the wild animal becomes tame. It is only eaten by \nsacrifice.  \n \n29.8 The 'Aqiqa  \n \n29.8a The 'Aqiqa is recommended  \n \nSacrificing an animal for the birth of a child ('Aqiqa) is a \nrecommended Sunnah. It should be done on the seventh \nday after the birth of the child, using a sheep similar in age \nand characteristics to what has been previously mentioned \nconcerning sacrifices for the ‘Id. The day on which the \nchild is born is not counted as one of the seven days. The \nanimal should be sacrificed in the morning \n  \nThe word derives from the hair of the head of child because it is \nslaughtered when the hair is cut. It is also said that it is because \nits veins are cut. It is recommended, not stressed. The basis for its \nlegality is what Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) related with \nan excellent isnad: the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Every child is in pawn for his 'Aqiqa.\" It is done for a boy or a girl \nprovided the child lives to the seventh day. It should be a sheep or \na goat without any defects which would prevent its sacrifice. The \nday he is born is not counted, unless he is born at Fajr, in which \ncase it is counted. It should be done in the morning and it is \ndisliked to do it from midday to sunset, and it is not allowed to be \ndone at night or before sunrise.  \n \n29.8b The child is not smeared with blood  \n \nThe child should not be smeared with any of the animal's \nblood \n  \nTo avoid the custom of the Jahiliyya which was to rub the head \nwith the blood for luck so that he might be courageous and blood-\nshedding.  \n \n29.8c What is done with the meat  \n \nIt can be eaten and given away as sadaqa and its bones can \nbe broken \n \ni.e. it is recommended for the people of his house and neighbors to \neat from it. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"Feeding people is the same as is done in sacrifices and there is no \nspecific amount which is given to people. He eats what he wishes \nand gives as sadaqa what he wishes, although sadaqa is more \nfitting since it is said that there is no 'Aqiqa until all or some of it \nis given as sadaqa.\" The aim of the 'Aqiqa is sadaqa and sadaqa \ncan be raw or cooked. It is recommended to break its bones as \nopposed to the Jahiliyya when they did not break its bones out of \nfear that it would affect the child.  \n \n29.8d Shaving the baby's head  \n \nIf the baby's head is shaved and the weight of hair in gold \nor silver given away as sadaqa that is a good practice \n  \nMale or female. This is based on a hadith of 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) in Shaikh at-Tirmidhi where the Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did an 'Aqiqa for al-Hasan (radhi‟Allahu anhu) with a \nram and said, \"Fatima, shave his head and give sadaqa in silver \naccording to the weight of the hair.\" It was weighed and it was a \ndirham or part of one. The fact that it is \"good\" means that it is \nrecommended. It is recommended that it he be named on the \nseventh day if there is an 'Aqiqa, and if there is no 'Aqiqa, the \nchild is named before that. It is recommended that something \nsweet go first to the stomach of the child because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) did that for 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talha \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) using a date.  \n \n29.8e Rubbing the head with other than blood  \n \nIf, instead of being rubbed with blood as was the custom \nbefore Islam, the baby's head is rubbed with a lotion \nconsisting of perfume mixed with rose water, there is no \nharm in this \n  \nBased on what is related by Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nfrom Burayda (radhi‟Allahu anhu) the Companion. He said, \"In \nthe Jahiliyya when one of us had a son, he would sacrifice a sheep \nand rub the head with its blood. When Allah azza wa jall brought \nIslam, we used to sacrifice a sheep and shave his head and rub it \nwith saffron.\"  \n \n29.9 Circumcision  \n \n29.9a Male circumcision  \n \nCircumcision is a confirmed Sunnah for males  \n \nIt is mandatory. It is disliked to be circumcised on the day of birth \nor the seventh day because it is the practice of the Jews. \nCircumcision should be performed before the time when he is \ncommanded to pray – from seven years to ten. There is \ndisagreement about whether or not to circumcise an adult who \nbecomes Muslim and fears for himself. Shaikh Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that circumcision is obliged for him, \nsaying, \"If it is mandatory to cut off the hands of thieves, is it left \nfor fear of himself?\" Someone who foregoes circumcision without \nexcuse is not allowed to be Imam or to give testimony.  \n \n29.9b Female circumcision  \n \nand \nfemale \ncircumcision \n(khifad) \nis \npraiseworthy \n(makruma) \n  \nTo remove what the woman has of excess. It is recommended \naccording to Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is worthy \nbecause it brightens the complexion and makes intercourse \npleasurable. \n  \n \n \nChapter 30: On Jihad \n \n \n30.1 Its meaning  \n \n Linguistically jihad is derived from jahd, which, according to al-\nMisbah, is effort in what someone does, or juhd which is ability. It \nis a technical term for the Muslim fighting the unbelievers who \nhave no treaty with the intention of elevating the word of Allah \nazza wa jall or presenting Islam.  \n \nJihad has obligations which must be met. They are:  \n \nObeying the ruler and so when he recommends going in a \nparticular direction to fight, it is binding to go there.  \n \nGhulul (misappropriation) must be abandoned: it means to take \nfrom the booty before it is divided.  \n \nHe must honor a safe-conduct pledge, and so when an unbeliever \nis granted safe-conduct, he must abide by it and he is not \npermitted after that to deem it lawful to kill him.  \n \nOne must not flee when the odds are two to one: which means \nstanding firm in the fray.  \n \nJihad has two categories; individual obligation and general \nobligation. When it becomes a specific duty to do it and it cannot \nbe opposed, whether if the person is one of those who are \nresponsible for the obligation of jihad or not, like the slave and \nchild who cannot fight and women, as when the enemy arrives \nsuddenly in the place and only these people are available, then it \nis an individual obligation for them. \n  \n30.2 How and when it is obligatory  \n \n30.2a An obligation  \n \nJihad is an obligation which can be taken on by some of \nthe people on behalf of others \n  \nBy the words of the Almighty: \"Those believers who stay behind – \nother than those forced by necessity – are not the same as those \nwho do jihad in the way of Allah.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:95) Allah azza \nwa jall has promised both good, i.e. the best reward which is the \nGarden. There is mutawatir Sunnah that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) sent some people rather than others.  \n \n30.2b Inviting people to Islam first  \n \nAnd it is preferable, according to us, that the enemy are \nnot fought until they have been invited to the din of Allah \nazza wa jall except if they attack first \n  \nThe Malikis prefer that each group be called upon to abandon \ntheir disbelief and be called to the shahadah whose contents are \nnot prescribed. He calls to the general message of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) for three days in succession unless \nthey attack first. Then the call is not recommended. Indeed, it \nbecomes obligatory to fight them.  \n \n30.2c Offering a choice between Islam and jizya \n  \nThey can either accept Islam or pay the jizya (tax on non-\nMuslims); if not they are to be fought  \n \nHis apparent words mean that they are given a choice between \nthe two at the same time. If they accept one, they are left. \nOtherwise they are fought. Al-Jawhar describes the call as Islam \nbeing offered to them. If they answer, they are left. If they refuse, \nthen jizya is offered to them, If they refuse, they are fought. All of \nthat is when there is a delay and there is time. If they attack \nbefore the call, preventing our call, they are fought because then \nthe call is unlawful.  \n \n30.2d Where jizya is acceptable  \n \nJizya is only acceptable in places where they are subject to \nour law. If they are a long way from our jurisdiction jizya \ncan only be accepted from them if they move to our \nterritory. If they do not do this they are to be fought \n  \nAbdullah \nibn \n'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) \nsaid \nthat \nthis \nprecondition is about the people of force. As for the people of truce, \nit is not a precondition for them. Jizya is accepted from them \nwhere they are because they restrained themselves until they paid \npeace for themselves and their lands.   \n \n30.2e Fleeing from the enemy not allowed  \n \nFleeing from the enemy is a major wrong action when their \nnumber is twice that of the Muslims or less \n  \nThis is when the unbelievers are twice that of the Muslims in \nstrength or stronger, or the business is not known. It is the well-\nknown position when they are considered weak according to the \nnumber, not the force, as opposed to Shaikh ibn al-Majishun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He says that they must be established as \nmore than twice the number if they are superior to the \nunbelievers in weapons and stronger in strength and resolve. The \nprohibition against flight is when he flees and does not intend to \nreturn. If he does that as a trick or to join another group so that \nthe enemy sees the retreat and follows him and he returns or he \nrejoins the amir or the group of the Muslims to help them, then it \nis not unlawful.  \n \n30.2f When flight is allowed  \n \nIf there are more than that there is no wrong in doing so \n  \nIf there are more than twice the number of Muslims, there is no \nharm in flight. Such it would appear, even if the Muslims number \nas many as 12,000, which is in an-Nawadir from Shaikh Sahnun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated from a group of the people of knowledge and he thinks that \nwhen the Muslims reach 12,000, they are not permitted to flee, \neven if the unbelievers are more than twice their number.  \n \n30.2g Fighting under any commander  \n \nThe enemy are to be fought whether the commander of the \nMuslims is right-acting or not \n  \nIt is obligatory for those for whom jihad is obligatory to fight the \nenemy. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah azza \nwa jall will support his din by the impious man.\" Perhaps if he \ndoes not fight with him, there might be harm for the Muslims.  \n \n30.2h Killing prisoners  \n \nThere is no harm in killing an enemy prisoner but you may \nnot kill anyone after a pledge of security has been given, \nnor may you break a treaty \n  \nWhen there is benefit in killing him. After security is given by the \nImam or someone else in the well-known position, contrary to the \none who says that security given by other than the Imam is \ndependent on the view of the Imam. The basis of the well-known \nposition is the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nabout a banner being set up for the treacherous on the Day of \nRising, when it will be said, \"This is the betrayal of so-and-so.\" It \nmeans that he will be known as treacherous on the Day of Rising \nso that the people there will censure him. Nor is a treaty to be \nbroken.  \n \n30.2i Not killing women and children  \n \nNor may you kill women and children  \n \nSince that prohibition is sound from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam). Similarly jizya is not imposed on them. The Imam can \ngive them choice between three: enslavement, freedom and \nransom.  \n \n30.2j Monks and priests and women who fight  \n \nKilling monks and priests should be avoided unless they \nare involved in the fighting. Similarly, women who fight \ncan also be killed \n  \nThe prohibition against killing monks is not by virtue of their \nmonasticism, because they are further from Allah azza wa jall \nbecause of the strength of their disbelief. They are left since the \npeople of their din leave them and so they are like women. Priests \n(rabbis) are left unless they actually fight. It is said that this \nrefers to women and children as well. Women can be killed if they \nare involved in the actual fighting. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) limits this to the state of fighting. When \nfighting is over, women are not killed. The predominant opinion is \nthat when women fight with weapons, they can be killed during \nthe fighting or afterwards, even if they did not fight anyone. \nAccording to the Mukhtasar, monks and nuns retain their \nfreedom, and it is forbidden either to kill them or to reduce them \nto slavery.  \n \n30.2k pledge of security  \n \nA pledge of security given by the least of the Muslims is \nbinding on the rest of then \n  \nThis security is granted to specific people, i.e. specific unbelievers. \nThe people of a region or town are not granted security except by \nthe ruler. If someone else makes such a contract, the ruler can \nbreak it if he wishes. We read in al-Jawahir, \"The precondition of \nthe security is that there is no harm in it for the Muslims. If \nsomeone grants security to a spy or scout or one who contains \nharm, it is not binding.\"  \n \n30.2l Women and children giving security  \n \nThis also applies when women do this, and also children \nprovided they are able to understand what is involved. It is \nalso said that this is only acceptable if the man in charge \nsays it is acceptable \n  \ni.e. if the child knows that it is unlawful to violate security, then \nhe is obliged to observe it.  \n \n30.3 Booty  \n \n30.3a The fifth  \n \nWhen the Muslims gain booty by having fought and won it, \ntheir leader takes one fifth and divides the remaining four-\nfifths between those doing the fighting. It is better for this \ndividing up to take place where the battle was fought \n  \nHe divides the fifth as he thinks best. He can put it in the \ntreasury or spend it on the welfare of the Muslims by buying \nweapons or other things beneficial for the Muslims. If he likes, he \ncan give it to the family of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) or others or give part of it to them and the rest to others. \nThis is when they take booty other than land: horses, linen, \nslaves, money and grain. Land is not divided in fifths or allotted. \nIt is entailed and its land-tax is spent on the best interests of the \nMuslims. After the fifth is taken, the rest of the booty is divided in \nthat place where the fighting took place since the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) did that because it is a punishment for the \nenemy.  \n \n30.3b Which booty is divided  \n \nOnly booty that has been fought for using horses and \ncamels or taken after combat is to be divided up in this \nway \n  \nAs for what is taken without combat or force, like that which is \ntake from the one who people have left when they hear that the \nMuslim army has advanced against them, there is no fifth nor \ndivision. It is at the discretion of the Imam as he can dispose of \nthe fifth of the booty wherever he wishes.  \n \n30.3c Use of food or fodder  \n \nIf part of the spoils consist of food or fodder, there is no \nharm in any who need it taking some before the division \ntakes place \n  \nThis means it is permitted with or without the permission of the \nleader. What is meant by food is what can be eaten: meat or other \nthings. The basis for what he said is found in the Sahih in the \nwords of Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \"We used to get \nhoney and grapes in our raids and we ate them and did not \npresent them to the commander. The four-fifths of the booty is \ndivided between the army according to the preconditions in the \nShari‟ah.  \n \n30.4 Distribution of shares  \n \n30.4a Those actively involved in jihad  \n \nA share of the booty is only given to those who take part in \nthe fighting or who are prevented from doing so by being \noccupied with the jihad in some other way \n  \nAn active presence is meant, whether fighting or being present to \nface the enemy. When the rows are formed and fighting has not \nbegun, there is no share for someone who dies then, but there is a \nshare for the one who dies after the fighting stops. Also those who \nare prevented by things like scouting or bringing equipment or the \nlike receive a share. There is a share for the one who gets lost \nfrom the army in enemy territory.  \n \n30.4b If someone is ill  \n \nAnyone who falls sick is given a share as is any horse that \nfalls sick \n  \nIf he becomes ill after or during the fighting, i.e. he is present \nhealthy at the beginning of it and then becomes ill and continues \nto fight while ill. If he becomes ill before being present at the \nfighting, whether his illness began in enemy territory or Muslim \nterritory, he has no share. If the horse goes lame after fighting or \nduring it, it has a share. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nsaid, \"It has no precondition, and that is the same if it becomes ill \nby for some other reason.\"  \n \n30.4c The share of the horse \n \nA horse gets two shares  \n \nThis is the horse and not the camel, mule and ass which have no \nshare. It is limited to one since he spends more for its provision \nand has no share.  \n \n30.4d The share of the rider  \n \nand a rider gets one share \n  \nThere is allowance of what is not ridden. The rider is said to the \nrider of camels. As for the rider of horses, he is called a horseman. \nThe basis in what is mentioned is that it is sound that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) gave the horse two shares and the \nrider one share.  \n \n30.4e Slaves, women and children  \n \nSlaves do not get a share nor do women nor do children, \nunless the children are really able to fight, have been given \npermission by the Imam, and do actually participate in the \nfighting in which they are given a share \n  \nFreedom is a precondition to receive it, and so the slave, whether \nhe fights or not, does not get a share. He must be male, so the \nwoman does not get a share, whether she fights or not. He must be \nan adult, so the child does not get a share except with three \npreconditions: that child who has not reached puberty is able to \nfight, has the permission of the Imam and actual participated. \nShaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmits from the \nMudawwana that it is explicitly stated as well-known that he has \nno share, whether he fights or not. The literal meaning of the \nhadith indicates lack of shares. The hadith quoted by Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) did not give a share to slaves, women or children.  \n \n30.4f Servants  \n \nA hired servant is not given a share unless he actually \nfights \n  \nHe must go out with the intention of jihad, especially the one \nwhose uses are owned, like the hired servant, and like the general \nhireling in the lack of the share. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) makes a distinction about those who actual fight.  \n \nThree preconditions remain: sanity, Islam, and health. The \nmadman has no share by agreement. The Dhimmi has no share by \ndisagreement if he does not fight or does fight in the well-known \nposition.  \n \n30.4g When the enemy becomes Muslim and has Muslim \nproperty in his possession \n \nIf anyone from the enemy becomes a Muslim and has in his \npossession property previously belonging to the Muslims, \nthat property remains in his possession. If anyone buys \nany of it from him it becomes theirs and the original owner \ncan only get it back by paying the correct price for it \n  \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it is clear from his \nwords that if he becomes Muslim with free Muslims in his \npossession, they are taken from him, and it is the well-known \nposition. According to him he is not recompensed for this. If a \nMuslim buys something in the abode of war, be it the property of \nMuslims or that of the dhimmis, it belongs to him, and the owner \ncan only get it back by paying the price which he paid for it if it is \nlawful to own. If it is something unlawful to own like wine and \npigs, its owner takes it without buying it.  \n \n30.4h Rights of the original owner  \n \nIf property of this kind is divided up as part of the booty \nthe original owner of a particular piece of property has the \nfirst right to it provided he pays the correct price for it \n  \nThis is if he finds it with someone who bought it from the booty. If \nhe finds in the share of someone or who is ignorant of the price, he \nonly takes it for the price connected the right of the other to it.  \n \n30.4i Claiming it before division  \n \nIf the division has not yet been made he can reclaim his \nproperty without having to pay anything for it \n  \nHe means when the Muslim or the Dhimmi finds his goods in the \nbooty before the division has taken place and has clear evidence of \nownership, he takes it without paying anything, but only after \ntaking a legal oath that he did not sell it, give it away, nor was it \nremoved from his property by legal means. Thus it is still be his \nproperty.  \n \n30.4j No one receives more than his basic share  \n \nNo one is permitted to receive more than their allotted \nshare unless it is given by the leader at his discretion from \nthe fifth apportioned to him and this cannot be done \nbefore the basic division is made \n  \nThis is based on what Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated about the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) allotting \nextra from the fifth at the Battle of Hunayn. This extra is only \nallotted after the division. On this basis, allotting it before the \ndivision is only conceivable by a promise. For instance he says, \n\"Whoever has killed someone has whatever is taken from the \ncorpse.\" These words can imply prohibition or dislike, i.e. the \nImam or general of the army is prohibited from saying this before \nhaving power over the enemy because that might lead to the \ninvalidation of their intentions because some of them expose \nthemselves to death for the sake of the goods of this world, and \nthen he would fight for the reward. After the fighting, that does \nnot need to be guarded against.  \n \n30.4k Arms, clothing and personal effects of the enemy  \n \nThe arms, clothing and personal effects of enemy soldiers \nkilled in the battle is treated as part of the fifth that can be \ngiven away at the leader's discretion \n  \nThe Imam only gives them from the fifth according to his \ndiscretion. Pickings are what are found with the dead person: \nclothes, weapons and similar equipment rather the dead idolaters \nhave of bracelets and crowns. It is like that with money. These \nthings are not part of pickings in the well-known school, i.e. as \nopposed to Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) who includes \nthe bracelets, crowns and money in the pickings.  \n \n30.5 Forts (Ribat)  \n \n30.5a Their excellence  \n \nGuarding a frontier post is an action of great excellence, \nwhich increases in virtue  \n \nLinguistically ribat means to reside, and in the Shari‟ah it means \nto reside at the frontiers in order to defend them. It includes \nmoney and other things, the Dhimmi and the Muslim. Guarding \nother things is a consequence of guarding the frontiers. The \nfrontier is the place where there is a possible defensive weakness.  \n \nIt is related that ribat is better than jihad based on what is in the \nSahih where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Ribat \none day in the way of Allah azza wa jall is better than this world \nand what is in it.\" It is better because the bliss of the Next World \nremains and does not run out, and also because ribat is in order to \npreserve the blood of the Muslims, and preserving their blood is \nbetter than shedding the blood of the idolaters.  \n \n30.5b The amount of danger  \n \naccording to the amount of danger experienced by the \npeople manning that post and the amount of caution they \nhave to take \n  \nThis excellence varies. It according to the number of the enemy, \nfear and caution. Fear increases caution.  \n \n30.6 Raids  \n \n30.6a Permission of parents  \n \nYou cannot go on jihad without the permission of your \nparents  \n \nIf they are both Muslims according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and with Shaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) in general whether they are Muslims or unbelievers.  \n \n30.6b A surprise attack  \n \nunless the enemy makes a surprise attack, raining your \ntown, in which case it is obligatory for you to put up a \ndefense. In such case parents' permission is not required \n  \nIf there is a sudden attack on the people of a certain town, then \nthe people of the town have to defend it. It is obligatory for the one \nwith a father or without, slave or free. In this slaves have shares \nbecause they are called on to perform jihad because when we \ndenied them a share, it was because it was not their \nresponsibility. It is now is their responsibility as mentioned in at-\nTahqiq. He mentioned that it is obligatory for those near them to \nhelp them. The author (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he does not \nask for his parents' permission in such a case, since it has become \nan individual obligation like hajj, the prayer and individual \nseeking knowledge because he is obliged to obey them in \nabandoning permissible and supererogatory things, not specific \nobligations.  \n \n \nChapter 31: On Oaths and Vows \n \n \nThis deals with what is permitted in oaths and vows and what is \nnot permitted or binding. It means with kaffarah (expiation) of the \noath and swearing. The yamin (oath, right hand) is real in the \nlimb and metaphorical in other contexts. It is said that the yamin \nis the limb and the oath is called yamin because when they made \noaths, one of them strike the other persons right hand with his \nright hand. So it was called an oath.  \n \n31.1 The form of an oath  \n \n31.1a Oaths are by Allah azza wa jall \n \nAnyone who swears an oath should do so by Allah azza wa \njall \n \nHe should swear by the name of Allah azza wa jall, not by the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) or anything else which is \nesteemed in the Shari‟ah or one of His attributes, like Oneness, \ntimelessness and existence.  \n \n31.1b Not making an oath  \n \nor keep quiet \n  \nHe should keep quiet unless he makes a proper oath since he is \nnot swearing by Allah azza wa jall. He is forbidden to swear by \nother than Allah azza wa jall since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Allah azza wa jall forbade you to swear by your \nfathers. Whoever takes an oath, should swear by Allah azza wa \njall or be silent.\" So he commands the silence for what is other \nthan oath by Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n31.1c Oaths involving divorce or emancipation  \n \nAnyone who swears an oath to divorce a wife or free a \nslave is to be punished for doing so although he still has to \nhold to his oath \n  \nThis is when he is adult and has knowledge and deliberately \nmakes such an oath. That impairs his testimony, It is clear from \nhis words that he is punished, whether he breaks the oath or not. \nAccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) the punishment is \nnot defined but is up to what the ruler thinks best: beating, \ncursing, or the like, which can vary with different people. In \naddition to punishing someone who makes an such an oath, he is \nobliged to carry out the oath he made about divorce or freeing \nwhen he breaks the oath. If he unsure whether he broke it or \nsuspects it or thinks it probable, he has broken it in the well-\nknown position. If he doubts whether he said,  \"You are divorced\" \nor not or is unsure about whether he made an oath and broke it or \ndid not make an oath and did not break it, he does nothing.  \n \n31.1d \"If Allah wills\" is not said in the oath  \n \nNo one should make an oath containing the safety clause, if \nAllah wills \n  \nThis is not done.  \n \n31.1e No kaffarah for oaths in which Allah is not \nmentioned  \n \nThere is no kaffarah (expiation) except for an oath made \nusing the name Allah or one of His other names or \nattributes \n  \nKaffarah is pointless otherwise. It is also done if he uses a name, \nlike the Almighty or the Creator, or one of His essential \nAttributes, like knowledge, power, will, hearing, seeing, and \nspeech and life. As for actions like provision, an oath is not made \nby them. The literal meaning of his words is that \"Allah willing\" \nhas no force when connected to divorce, as when he says, \"If I \nenter the house, you are divorced, Allah willing.\" Shaikh ibn al-\nMajishun (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that if he means an action, \nlike entering the house, it has force. The position of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it does not apply, even if he \nmeans the action. When he enters the house, then the divorce \noccurs. It is that which is believed by Shaikh Khalil (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), and is the well-known position.  \n \n31.1f Saying it at the same time as the oath  \n \nIf someone does use a safety clause he does not have to do \nkaffarah as long as he intends the provision and says \n'Insha'Allah' at the same time as he makes his oath. If this \nis not the case such a provision bears no weight \n  \nWhen he swears by Allah azza wa jall or one of His attributes, he \ndoes not have to do kaffarah with three preconditions.  \n \nHe must have meant the provision, i.e. intended to dissolve the \noath without any difference in the aim is that it was before the \noath, during it or after he finishes, then it applies as Shaikh at-\nTata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) states. If he does it without intention, \nas out of forgetfulness or for blessing, it does not dissolve the oath.  \n \nHe must say \"Allah willing\"; the intention alone is not enough.  \n \nIt must be connected to the oath before it. So if he is silent more \nthan enough necessary for a breath or sneezes. If he is forced to \nstop, there is no harm.  \n \n31.2 Kinds of oaths  \n \nThere are four kinds of oaths which can be sworn by Allah \nazza wa jall \n  \n31.2a Oaths for which there is kaffarah  \n \nYou do kaffarah for two of these; namely, if you swear by \nAllah azza wa jall, \"If I do such-and-such a thing, I will do \nsuch-and-such a thing\", or if you swear by Allah azza wa \njall, \"I will do such-and-such a thing\"  \n \nOne of the two is that the oath in the promise to perform a good \ndeed. The first is when he swears that he will do something or not \ndo something, and then if he fails to do, he has broken it.  \n \n31.2b Oaths for which there is no kaffarah  \n \nThe two kinds you do not do kaffarah for are firstly when \nyou make an oath about something, thinking at the time it \nis true and later realizing that it isn't. In this case you do \nnot do kaffarah, nor is there any wrong action involved \n  \nThe first category is when you think that it is true. This does not \nmean that you think it is probable. What is meant is feeling \ncertain, not it being unequivocal according to the evidence, but \nthen later the opposite becomes clear. This is what he believes to \nbe true. Belief is strong assumption. If it is not strong, then there \nin lack of clarity or even doubt. He owes no kaffarah and there is \nno sin involved since Allah azza wa jall says, \"Allah will not take \nyou to task for inadvertent statements in your oaths, but He will \ntake you to task for oaths you make intentionally.\" (5:89) We read \nin the Mudawwana, \"There is no inadvertency except in the oath \nby Allah azza wa jall or a vow which cannot be avoided, ' i.e. the \nunclear vow, as when he says, \"If I do this, then I have a vow\" and \nthe inadvertent has no effect in divorce, setting free or an unclear \nvow.  \n \n31.2c Oaths for which there is no kaffarah  \n \nThe other kind is if you swear an oath about something \nknowing it to be untrue or having doubt about it. In this \ncase there is a wrong action involved but no kaffarah \n  \nA doubtful oath is one, for instance, where you swear that you met \nsomeone the previous day but you did not meet him or are unsure \nabout it. Doubt is weak supposition. So he swears to a lie or is \nunsure, and so he definitely sins, even if what he swears is true. \nBut there is no kaffarah if it is connected to the past. If it is \nconnected to the present or future, there is kaffarah. It is like that \nwhen the inadvertent oath is connected to the future. If it is \nconnected to the past, there is no kaffarah.  \n \n31.2d Repentance in any case  \n \nYou must, however, do tauba to Allah azza wa jall, on \naccount of it \n  \nBecause it is one of the major wrong actions and you should draw \nnear to Him with what you can do of freeing slaves, sadaqa and \nfasting.  \n \n31.3 Kaffarah  \n \nKaffarah for oaths consists of  \n \nThere are four types of expiation. There is choice between three \nforms feeding, clothing or freeing, and fourth follows the lack of \nability to do either of the three: it is fasting. The best of the them \nis feeding which is why he began with it. \n  \n31.3a Types  \n \n31.3a1 Feeding  \n \nfeeding ten needy people, who are Muslim and free, giving \none mudd to each measuring by the mudd of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam), but according to us it is \nbetter to increase that by a third or a half \n  \nFrom this is clear that feeding has five preconditions  \n \nNumber (ten) and so it is not allowed to give it to more or less, nor \nto one several times. When he gives five people two mudds each, \nhe gives to five and completes it with another five people. He can \ngive a larger amount provided that it remains in the possession of \nthe poor and he does not destroy it. The time of paying it must be \nmade clear that it is kaffarah. If he feeds twenty people half a \nmudd, that is not allowed.  \n \nThat they are poor, If he gives it to rich people knowingly, that is \nnot allowed.  \nThat they are Muslims. If he gives it to the poor of the dhimmis, it \nis not allowed, as is the case with zakat. \n  \nThat they are free. If he gives it to a slave, that is not allowed.  \nThat what is given of the mudd to each poor person is by the mudd \nof the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  and it not allowed \nwith anything else.  \n \nTwo things can take the place of the mudd: two ratls of bread with \nseasonings of oil or yogurt, or meat. As for feeding them lunch and \ndinner, or two lunches or two dinners, and to have lunch or \nsupper, that is not enough, even if it reaches a mudd. We think it \nbetter to increase give more than a mudd.  \n \nYou add a third or a half according to what the prevailing \nstandard of living is and whether the price of staples at the \ntime is high or low. However if you only give one mudd \nregardless of these considerations, you have fulfilled the \nobligation.  \n \nThis is based on the medium standard of life and the type of grain \nusually eaten, no matter what the price. Any a mudd in any land \nand in every time without adding to it satisfies it because it is the \nobligation.  \n \n31.3a2 Clothing  \n \nIf you give clothing you should give a man a robe and a \nwoman a robe and a head-covering \n  \nIf he chooses clothing, then he clothes ten poor people. There is no \ndifference between the child and the adult in giving the clothing \nand support. It is not a precondition that the clothing be from the \nmiddle of its people because Allah made that a precondition in \nfood but not clothing.  \n \n31.3a3 Freeing  \n \nKaffarah can also be done by freeing a believing slave  \n \nThey stipulate preconditions in it. One is that the slave is a \nbeliever, and so an unbeliever is not adequate. The second is that \nthe slave is free of faults which would impair him, like blindness, \nsenility. As for that which does impair, it is allowed. The third is \nthat it is someone who has firm ownership after buying, and not a \nconditional purchase. The fourth is he has full ownership, and is \nnot shared, The fifth is that there is no contract to purchase \nfreedom.  \n \n31.3a4 Fasting  \n \nbut if you cannot do this or feed people, then you should \nfast three consecutive days although if you do them \nseparately, you have still fulfilled the obligation \n  \nIf all three are impossible, then there is fourth course which he \nindicates. It is recommended to fast for three consecutive days \nbecause it is hurrying to discharge responsibility. If the three are \nseparate, then it is still correct, but there must be an intention \nmade each night.  \n \n31.3b When kaffarah is obliged  \n \nYou can do kaffarah either before or after failing to fulfill a \nvow, although doing it afterwards is preferable according \nto us \n  \nThis appears to be generally applicable, whether the oath is for an \nact of piety or on account of failing to do something, like kaffarah \nfor the fast or something else, but it is preferable to expiate it \nafterwards.  \n \n31.4 Vows  \n \n31.4a Which vows must be fulfilled  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow involving obedience to Allah \nazza wa jall must fulfill it whereas anyone who makes a \nvow involving disobedience to Allah azza wa jall must not \nfulfill it and no reparation is necessary \n  \nLinguistically Nadhr means making something binding, and in \nthe Shari‟ah it is to oblige oneself to do something which is an act \nwhich brings one near Allah azza wa jall. There are two \ncategories: a vow involving obedience which must fulfilled, and a \nvow involving disobedience which must not be fulfilled. When it is \nnot obligatory to fulfill it, according to Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) there is kaffarah for it, but that is not the \nposition of the majority, as he stated here.  \n \n31.4b Vows made respecting other people's property  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow to give sadaqa with someone \nelse's money or to free a slave belonging to someone else is \nnot under obligation to fulfill it \n  \nHe owes no sadaqa or freeing in that which has no precondition. If \nit is connected to a precondition, then he must do it when the \nprecondition exists according to the famous position, like, \"I would \nfree so-and-so if I owned him.\"  \n \n31.4c Fulfilling the vow  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow that if he does a particular thing, \nhe will do a specific good action, such as praying or fasting \nor going on hajj or 'umra, or giving away something \nspecific as sadaqa, must do what he said he was going to do \neven if he fails to fulfill his vow straight away \n  \nWhether it is obligatory or forbidden, and so he binds himself to do \nwhat he vowed what he stipulated. This is when he mentions a \nspecific thing with his tongue or in his heart and it is a pious \naction. The unlawful and permissible are excluded and so a vow \nwhich does not involve a good action would not be binding. So in \nthe case of sadaqa, he may name an amount or simply make an \nintention connected to worship and ability. That is then binding. \nHe must carry it out, even if he did not intend an amount. If it is \nprayer, then it is the least of that to which the name prayer \napplies, which is two rak'ats. In the case of fasting, when it is not \nspecified, it is the minimum which can be fasting is applied, which \nis a day. If he says, \"If I speak to so-and-so, then I must walk to \nMakka,\" then it is obliged for him to walk on hajj or 'umra. As for \nsadaqa, if he does not name anything, he must give a third of his \nproperty. If he names, then the literal meaning of his words is \nbinding, even if it is all his property. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said. \"If he mentions his house and it is all \nthat he has, then he must do that.  \n \n31.4d When the vow is not accompanied by an oath  \n \nThis is the case even if his vow is not backed up by an oath \n  \nIt is binding.  \n \n31.4e An unspecified vow  \n \nIf anyone makes a vow without specifying a particular \ngood action to be done if he fails to fulfill it, and then does \nfail to fulfill it, should atone for it by doing the kaffarah for \noaths \n  \nIf he does not name anything specific in his vow so that it can be \nachieved, as when he says, \"By Allah, I have made a vow\" without \nsaying whether it is prayer, fasting, hajj or the like, he owes \nkaffarah for an oath in the School.  \n \n31.5 Oaths and vows to do wrong  \n \n31.5a There is no reparation for a vow to do a wrong action  \n \nAnyone who makes a vow to do a wrong action such as \nkilling someone or drinking wine or something similar, or \nto do something which is neither a good action nor a \nwrong action, does not have to make any reparation for \nfailing to fulfill it, but should seek forgiveness from Allah \nazza wa jall \n  \nOr something permissible or disliked. He does not have to do \nkaffarah.  \n \n31.5b Kaffarah for such oaths  \n \nIf anyone swears by Allah azza wa jall to do a wrong action \nhe should do the kaffarah for oaths and not do the thing he \nswore to do. However, if he is so bold as to do the thing he \nswore to do he has committed the wrong action but does \nnot have to do the kaffarah for breaking his oath \n  \nIf he swears by the name of Allah azza wa jall or one of His \nattributes, then he should do kaffarah. If he does not action \nwithout concern for its consequences, then he does not have to \nperform kaffarah.  \n \n31.6 Kaffarah for various oaths and vows  \n \n31.6a When there is a double kaffarah  \n \nAnyone who says in his oath \"By the pact of Allah and His \ncovenant\" and then fails to fulfill it has to do a double \nkaffarah  \n \nBecause the covenant is an oath and the pact is an oath. If he \ncombines them, he swears two oaths. What he mentions differs \nfrom the famous position which is found in at-Tawdih that the \nkaffarah is not repeated when the oath-taker intended to stress \nthe oath or it was unintentional.  \n \n31.6b A single kaffarah  \n \nHowever, anyone who emphasizes his oath about one \nspecific thing by repeating it only would have to do a \nsingle kaffarah \n  \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said when the oath is \nrepeated on the same thing, it is not a new oath, if the aim is \nrepetition, i.e. there is not another kaffarah. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-\nSalam (rahmatullahi alaihi) said he means that when he swears \nto someone by one of the Names or Attributes of Allah and then \nrepeats the oath by that specific Name or Attribute connected to \nthat specific thing. If he intends a second oath to stress the first or \ndoes not have an intention, he does not have to do the kaffarah \nagain. If he intended multiple kaffarah, then it is agreed that it is \nmultiple. If he intends to formulate and is not alluding to a \nmultiple kaffarah, then the famous position is that it is not \nmultiple. It is understood that it as about one thing. If, for \ninstance, he repeats it about two things, he owes the kaffarah of \nan oath for each, as when he says, \"By Allah, I will not speak to \nso-and-so, and by Allah, I will not eat from this food, and by Allah, \nI will not wear this garment.\"  \n \n31.6c Oaths for which there is no kaffarah  \n \nAnyone who says, \"I am a mushrik,\" or that he is a Jew or a \nChristian if he does such-and-such, does not have to make \nany reparation and nothing is binding on him except that \nhe must seek Allah azza wa jall’s forgiveness  \n \nI seek refuge with Allah - or any similar sort of expression. He \nowes no kaffarah because it was not by any of the Names of Allah \nor His Attributes and so does not entail a binding oath. He must \nonly repent and no shahadah is demanded of him. Of course, \nasking forgiveness is an act of devotion to Allah azza wa jall, like \nemancipation, sadaqa and fasting.  \n \n31.6d No kaffarah for making something lawful unlawful  \n \nand anyone who makes something haram for himself \nwhich Allah azza wa jall has made halal does not have to \ndo kaffarah  \n \nIn the form of food or drink. He owes no kaffarah but must ask \nforgiveness for that sin because it is Allah azza wa jall who makes \nthings lawful and unlawful and he has criticized Allah by doing \nthat by the words of the Almighty, \"Say: 'What do you think about \nthe things Allah has sent down to you as provision which you have \nthen designated as lawful and unlawful?' Say: 'Has Allah given \nyou authority to do this or are you inventing lies against Allah?'\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 10:59) There are two exceptions to that.  \n \n31.6e An exception: divorce  \n \nexcept in the case of his wife who then does become haram \nfor him until after she has been through another marriage \n  \nThis is when someone says that his wife is haram for him. This is \nbecause making her haram amounts to a treble divorce and so she \nis not lawful for him until she has been through another marriage \nwhich has been consummated. If it has not been consummated, \nthen a treble divorce must have occurred in it unless he intended \nthe minimum. The second case is when he makes his slavegirl \nunlawful and intends to free her. By that she becomes unlawful to \nhim.  \n \n31.6f A vow to give away all of one's property  \n \nIf you make an oath or vow to give your wealth away as \nsadaqa or as a free gift [to the House of Allah] giving away \na third is sufficient to fulfill the oath \n  \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that if that that is \nthe case in an oath or vow and also when he does not name \nsomething specific. If he names it, it is binding on him, even if it is \nall of his property. This is also the case when he gives it to a \nspecific person like Zayd or the Banu Zayd: all of that is binding \nwhen he makes the oath unless he would be reduced and then he \nis left what a bankrupt is left.  \n \n31.6g A vow to sacrifice one's son  \n \nIf you make an oath to sacrifice your son, then if you \nremember what happened with Prophet Ibrahim (alaihi \nsalam) you should sacrifice an animal which should be \nslaughtered in Makka and the minimal sacrifice for this is \na sheep. If, however, the example of Prophet Ibrahim (alaihi \nsalam) does not enter your thoughts there is no need for \nyou to make any reparation \n  \nAs when you say, \"If I do not do such-and-such, I will sacrifice my \nson,\" and then recall the story of the Prophet Ibrahim (alaihi \nsalam) and his son, then you sacrifice an animal, a camel, cow or \nsheep, in Makka or at Mina if you stop at 'Arafat. It is said to be \nrecommended or obligatory, which is the more likely. The \nminimum is a sheep which is disliked if a larger animal is \npossible. It can be male or female. If you do not remember the \nstory at all, then there is no sacrifice or kaffarah, but you should \nask Allah azza wa jall's forgiveness.  \n \n31.7 An oath to walk to Makka  \n \n31.7a Such an oath is binding  \n \nIf you make an oath to walk to Makka and fail to do so it is \nstill binding on you to walk from the place where you made \nthe oath and it is up to you whether you go for hajj or \n'umra \n  \nAs when you say, \"If I do a certain thing, I will walk to Makka.\" If \nyou do that thing, then you must walk from the land in which you \nmade the oath, not from the place in which you resides, unless you \nspecified a place. You have a choice about whether it is in hajj or \n'umra when you did not intend either. That is the famous position: \nthere is a choice when there is no intention. The end of achieving \nthe oath in 'umra is after finishing sa'y. In the hajj it is after \nfinishing the Tawaf al-Ifada.  \n \n31.7b When riding becomes impossible  \n \nIf it becomes impossible for you to walk at any point you \nshould ride. But if you later become able to walk you \nshould walk that part of the journey where you rode. If you \nare certain you will not be able to fulfill the oath you stay \nwhere \nyou \nare \nand \nmake \na \nsacrifice. \nWhat \n'Ata' \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said about this is that you should not \ngo over any part of your journey a second time and that \nyou can sacrifice instead \n  \nThis oath is dependent on ability. If you become able to walk, then \nyou ride and later you can return and walk. If you know that he \ncannot, you make a sacrifice - preferably a camel, or a cow, or a \nsheep. If you do not know what you walked and what you rode, \nyou walk the whole way. If you know that you will not be able to \nwalk, you sacrifice and do not have to return again. 'Ata' ibn Abi \nRabah (rahmatullahi alaihi), one of the mujtahids, said that you \ndo not have to return again and the sacrifice takes care of it. This \nis part of the disagreement in the Maliki School in which there is \nchoice.  \n \n31.7c When someone who has not performed hajj makes \nthis vow  \n \nIf you have not yet gone on hajj [and it was not part of \nyour intention when you made the oath to walk to Makka \nto do so] you must do an 'umra first and when you have \nfinished your tawaf and sa'y and shorten your hair, you \nmay then go into ihram from Makka for the fard of hajj as \na mutamatti'. In any other case you should shave your \nhead but in this instance it is recommended to merely \nshorten the hair in order to retain an unkempt appearance \nduring the hajj \n  \nIf you not have not yet performed hajj when you make an oath to \nwalk to Makka, then it is mandatory that the walking be in 'umra, \nbased on what the Mukhtasar states, when there is no intention. \nWhen you have an intention, you walk as you intended. It is \nrecommended that after the tawaf, sa'y and shortening your hair, \nyou then assume ihram from the masjid according to the \nMudawwana or at its door according to Shaikh ibn Habib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Then you make the intention for the hajj of \nIslam, and you add 'umra to hajj if it is in the months of hajj. He \nshould shorten only shorten and not shave his hair in this case.  \n \n31.7d An oath to walk to Madina or Jerusalem  \n \nIf you make an oath to walk to Madina or to Jerusalem it is \nall right to ride to them if your original intention was to do \nthe prayer in either of the two masjids. If you meant \nsomething else you do not have to fulfill you oath at all \n  \nYou can walk to them in the well-known position. Shaikh ibn \nWahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that you must walk to them \nwhile Shaikh al-Lakhmi (rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh al-Maziri \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others recommended that because it is \ncan act of piety which should be fulfilled. You are obliged to go to \nthem only if you intend an obligatory prayer - although some say a \nvoluntary prayer and retreat in their masjids. If you do not intend \nto pray, you owe nothing because walking itself is not worship.  \n \n31.7e An oath to walk to any other masjid  \n \nIf you make an oath to pray in any masjid other than one \nof these three, you should not go either walking or riding, \nbut you should do that prayer in the place where you are \n  \nWhether it is near or far based on what is reported in Muslim \nwhere the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Animals are \nonly saddled for three masjids: my masjid, the Masjid al-Haram, \nand the Masjid al-Aqsa.\"  \n \n31.8 A vow to man the frontier  \n \nIf you make an oath to man a post in any place on the \nfrontiers of Islam you have to do it \n  \nEven if he is one of the people of Makka and Madina. That vow \nshould be fulfilled because manning the frontier is an act of \ndevotion to Allah azza wa jall and if you vow an act of devotion, \nyou must fulfill your vow.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 32: On marriage, divorce, remarriage, \n'Dhihar'-repudiation, vows of celibacy within \nmarriage, mutual cursing (li'an), 'Khul'-\n'divorce, and suckling \n \n \nThese are eight things. The first, marriage, is the root and rest are \nconsequences. Each has a linguistic meaning and usage which we \nwill mention in its proper place. Marriage (nikah) linguistically \nmeans intercourse and is used as a metaphor for the contract. In \ntechnical usage, it is actual for the contract and metaphorical for \nintercourse. It is used in custom to mean intercourse as the \nAlmighty says, \"Until she marries a husband other than him,\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 2:230) and so it is known from this that nakaha is \nused for intercourse between any man and woman. Marriage in \nthe sense of intercourse is only permitted in the Shari‟ah by one of \ntwo matters: the contract of marriage or ownership by the words \nof the Almighty, \"those who guard their private parts – except \nfrom their wives or those they own as slaves, in which case they \nare not blameworthy.\" (Holy Qur‟an 23:5-6)  \n \nMarriage has four pillars: the wali, the place, the form and the \nobligatory dower.   \n \n32.1 Obligatory elements for the validity of marriage  \n \n32.1a A guardian  \n \nMarriage is not valid without a guardian [wali] \n  \nThere is no marriage contract except with a guardian. As Shaikh \nibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, the guardian is either her \nowner (in the case of a slave), or her father or male relative, or an \nagent or guardian, or the authority (the ruler) or someone who is \nMuslim.  \n \nPreconditions for that are being Muslim, free, adult, sane and \nmale. Integrity is not a precondition for the validity of the contract \nin the famous position, but part of its perfection, nor is common \nsense. So the fool can make a contract for his daughter with the \npermissible of his guardian according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). This is a precondition of validity and the \ncontract is not valid without a guardian by the statement of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"A woman does not give \nherself or another woman in marriage. The woman who gives \nherself in marriage is guilty of fornication.\" [as Daraqutni \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) who said that it is sahih and hasan.] If it \noccurs without a guardian, then the marriage is null and void both \nbefore and after consummation, even if she gives birth to several \nchildren. There are two transmission about whether the \nnullification is a divorce or not.  \n \n32.1b A dowry  \n \na dowry \n  \nThe dowry is a precondition for the validity of consummation \nbecause of the words of the Almighty \"Give women their dowry as \nan outright gift.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:4)  \n \n32.1c Two witnesses  \n \nand two legally acceptable witnesses \n  \nHaving two witnesses is also a precondition for the validity of \nconsummation, not for the contract. It is a precondition that the \ntwo witnesses of the marriage be reputable, based on what Shaikh \nibn Hibban (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted in his Sahih: the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no marriage \nexcept with a wali and two legally acceptable witnesses.\" Marriage \nwithout those preconditions is invalid according to the hadith. If \nthere are no legally acceptable witnesses, then there should be a \nlot of witnesses, like 30 or 40.  \n \nOne of the preconditions of the validity of the contract is the form \nof the contract from the wali and husband or agent. The guardian \nmust use an expression which would entail permanent transfer \nlike \"I have given to you in marriage\". The husband must use an \nexpression which entails acceptance, like \"I have accepted.\" The \norder is not a precondition, but is recommended. If the husband \nspeaks first and then the guardian speaks after him, the contract \nis sound as long as the two responses are immediate; a slight \ndifference does not impair the contract as opposed to a major \ndifference. This would be, for instance, if a man who is ill were to \nsay, \"If I die from this illness, I have given my daughter in \nmarriage to so-and-so,\" and then dies a month later, and the \nhusband accepts the contract after his death. The marriage is not \nvalid.  \n \nNOTE: A marriage is contracted by the acceptance and answer, \neven if it was intended a joke on both sides because marriage is a \nserious matter.  \n \n32.1d Witnesses must be present at the contract  \n \nIf these two are not present to witness the actual making \nof the contract, it is not permissible for the couple to \nconsummate their marriage until the witnessing has taken \nplace \n  \ni.e. the guardian and husband. In one text, it has the singular, \nmeaning the husband. If it is consummated without witnessing, \nthe marriage is invalidated with a final divorce and they receive \nthe hadd-punishment if they did not make it known and do not \nhave the excuse of ignorance and admit intercourse. If they make \nit known, there is no hadd, especially they have a feast, drums \nand one witness.  \n \n32.1e Minimum amount of dowry \n  \nThe smallest acceptable amount for a dowry is a quarter of \na dinar \n  \nThat by which the contract becomes valid. The dinar is of pure \ngold and in silver it is three dirhams of pure silver. It can be an \nequivalent value in goods. There is no maximum because the \nAlmighty says \"Give one of them a qintar.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:20)  \n \n32.2 The authority of the guardian  \n \n32.2a A father arranging the marriage of a virgin daughter \n  \nA father can arrange the marriage of his virgin daughter \nwithout her permission even if she is beyond the age of \npuberty. It is up to him whether he consults her or not  \n \nTo whomever he wants for the dowry he wishes, even for less than \na suitable dowry. He can give her choice, and it states in al-\nJawahir and elsewhere that it is recommended that he ask her \npermission.  \n \n32.2b Someone other than the father arranging the \nmarriage of a virgin  \n \nHowever, if anyone other than the father is arranging the \nmarriage of a virgin, such as a guardian appointed in the \nfather's will or anyone else, he cannot give her in marriage \nunless she is beyond the age of puberty and has given her \nconsent. In this case her silence is taken as consent \n  \nIt says in the Mudawwana that an orphan is not given in \nmarriage by her guardian until she comes of age and gives \npermission. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"unless \nthere is a will from the father to marry her to a certain person and \nthen he acts in loco parentis. There is a text in the Mukhtasar \nwhich states that the guardian as the same position as the father \nin compulsion to marriage with two preconditions. One is that he \nthe husband is specified and the other is that the father \ncommands that. The Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) states after \nthis, \"The girl is not married unless her father commanded that \nshe be married.\" What he mentioned about other relatives than \nthe guardian, like the grandfather and brother, is known in the \nSchool.  \n \n32.2c A woman who has been married before  \n \nA woman who has already been married cannot be given in \nmarriage, by her father or anyone else unless she herself \nagrees to it and gives verbal consent  \n \nWhen she is adult, sane and free and has not lost her virginity \nthrough injury or fornication, be she sensible or foolish, by her \nfather or anyone else. It is limited to the adult instead of the child \nwho loses her virginity before becoming an adult. Her marriage is \nnot dependent on her consent. \"Sane\" excludes the mad woman. \nHer father can compel her, even if she has children. The judge can \nalso compel the adult mad women if she has no father.  \n \nWhat is mentioned about asking her permission is by word, as \nImam \nMalik \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nImam \nash-Shafi‟i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), and Sahih Muslim transmitted, \"The widow \nis more entitled to herself than her guardian, and the virgin is \nasked for consent for herself, and her consent is her silence.\" What \nis meant by the widow is the non-virgin. The difference between \nthe two is the shyness which is found more fully in the virgin \nrather than the non-virgin. It is reported from Shaikh ibn al-\nQassar (rahmatullahi alaihi) that modesty has ten parts: nine in \nwomen and one in men. When a woman marries, a third of it goes. \nWhen she gives birth, two-thirds is gone, and if she fornicates, it is \nall gone.  \n \n32.2d The necessity of the consent of the guardian  \n \nA woman can only be married if she has the consent of her \nguardian or someone suitably qualified from among her \npeople, such as one of her male relations, or the governor \n  \nOr her agent since a guardian is a precondition for the validity of \nthe contract - there is no disagreement about that with us - or \nwith the permission of someone qualified, which means those who \npossess the preconditions of guardianship which are: being male, \nfree, sane, adult, not in ihram, and not a unbeliever for a Muslim \nwoman. The ruler acts in default of such a person.  \n \n32.2e Lowly women  \n \nThere is a difference of opinion regarding lowly women \n(daniyya) as to whether they can have a guardian that is \nnot related to them or not \n  \nThis is the woman who has neither beauty, money nor position. \nWhen she has beauty, money or position, she is noble. Position is \nlike lineage and descent, or a noble father.  \n \nA guardian who is not related is a Muslim, i.e. he is not a \nguardian nor one qualified from her family nor a client nor a ruler \nwhen there is a particular guardian. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that she is permitted to appoint him \neven when there is a relative. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that that is not permitted unless there is no relative. \nSo the two Shaikhs agree on the validity but differ about when \nthis can be done. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says \nthat it is valid although disliked, which is the reliable position, \nwhile Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is not.  \n \n32.2f Order of precedence in matrimonial guardians \n  \nA woman's son has more right to be her marriage guardian \nthan her father and her father has more right than her \nbrother. After this the nearer the relationship the greater \nthe right \n  \nThe son is a closer relative because he is the most entitled of her \nrelatives after her father. The father is more entitled than the \nbrother (full or half) because the brother is not as close as the \nfather and the father will debar him from inheritance.  \n \n32.2g The marriage is valid when the more distant acts as \nguardian  \n \nHowever, if the more distant relative acts as guardian the \nmarriage is nevertheless still valid \n  \nEven when a nearer relative exists, like the brother. The marriage \nis valid because the order between them is only about suitability. \nDiffering from it is only disliked provided the marriage is with an \nequal. If the husband is not an equal, then it is obliged for the \ncloser relative to reject the marriage, even if the woman is pleased \nwith it. If he does not reject it, it is presented to the ruler, i.e. it is \nobligatory to reject it and she is not permitted to consent. It is \ninvalid.  \n \n32.2h A guardian appointed in a will \n  \nA guardian appointed in a will can arrange the marriage of \na male child under his guardianship  \n \ni.e. he can compel him to marry, like the father, when that has \nbenefit, like marrying him to a rich or noble woman.  \n \n32.2i The limitations of such a guardian  \n \nbut he cannot arrange the marriage of a female child \nunless the father has given him specific instructions to do \nso \n  \nAnd if he has specified the husband, when he says \"Marry her to \nso-and-so.\" According to the Mukhtasar, it is enough that he \ncommands her to compel her to marry that he can marry her to \nwhomever he wishes.  \n \n32.2j Agnate relatives  \n \nMale relatives on the maternal side are not considered \nsuitable as marriage guardians who should rather come \nfrom the paternal side  \n \nTo act in giving in marriage, whether they are heirs like the \nbrothers by the mother or not, like the maternal uncle. The \nguardians come from the paternal side, the stronger being \nadvanced first. So the full brother comes before the half brother by \nthe father. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"It is \nclear from his words that the guardian is only one of the paternal \nrelatives, and there is a contradiction when he says 'someone \nsuitably qualified from among her people, or the governor.' The \nreply is that the what is meant here about the relative being only \nfrom the paternal relatives does not preclude the one who is not a \npaternal relative being a protector or ruler, and so it is relative.  \n \n32.3 Competition between suitors  \n \nNo one should propose marriage to a woman if another \nproposal has already been accepted, nor should anyone try \nto outbid his brother, if an agreement has already been \nreached \n  \nAccording to what Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"The expression means a prohibition.\" This is to propose when \nthere is an outstanding proposal and to bid when there is an \noutstanding bid provided an agreement has been reached between \nthe couple of the parties to the bid. In respect of marriage, this \nmeans that the couple incline to one another so that only the offer \nand its acceptance remain. In the sale it is a precondition that the \nmoney be weighed, for instance, and the goods free of faults. If he \nsees a fault, he can return it.  \n \n32.4 Forbidden types of Marriage  \n \n32.4a The Shighar marriage  \n \nA 'Shighar' marriage - which is when there is a direct \nexchange of daughters without any dowry - is not \npermitted \n  \nThere are three types of forbidden marriage. Shighar is to \nexchange one woman for another. The basis for its prohibition is \nfound in the Muwatta' and two Sahih collections where the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade the Shighar. It is \nderived from lifting, as when a dog lifts its leg to urinate or when \na person lifts their leg for copulation. It is also used from a land is \ndevoid of people. It is used for exchanging women without a \ndowry. The pure Shighar is that a man gives his daughter in \nmarriage to a man provided that he marries his daughter to him \nwith no exchange of dowry. The woman whose marriage is \nconsummated \nreceives \nan \nappropriate \ndowry \nand \nthe \nunconsummated has nothing.  \n \n32.4b Marriage without a dowry  \n \nneither is marriage without a dowry \n  \nIf they stipulate that it be dropped. If that happens, then it well-\nknown that it is nullified before consummation, and she receives \nnothing. There are two positions about whether its nullification \namounts to a divorce. After consummation she receives a suitable \ndower and the child is connected to him and there is no hadd-\npunishment because of the dispute.  \n \n32.4c Temporary marriage  \n \nnor is temporary marriage - which is marriage for a \nspecified, limited period \n  \nBy consensus. This is found in Khalil, the Mudawwana and \nelsewhere, whether it is a short or long term such that the person \nwill not live that long. Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that it is marriage with a dowry, guardian and witnesses \nwhich is unsound by setting a term, and its judgment is that it is \nalways invalid without a divorce. If anyone marries a woman in a \ntemporary marriage but does not enjoy her, it is permitted for his \nfather and son to marry her. There is no hadd for them, and the \nchild is attached to the father and she observes full „Idda. She \nreceives no dowry if it was voided before consummation. If it is \nafter that, she receives the dowry appropriate to her whether or \nnot a dower was stipulated for her.  \n \n32.4d Marriage during the idda  \n \nMarriage during the ‘Idda period is also forbidden  \n \nThis means forming a contract while she is in her „Idda, whether \nthat it for the death of a spouse or divorce, irrevocable or \nrevocable, based on the words of the Almighty, \"until the book \nreaches its term.\" The consensus on that if anyone forms a \ncontract with a woman during „Idda, it is nullified without divorce \nbecause it is agreed to be unsound. If it is consummated, they are \npunished as are the witnesses if they are aware of that. She \nreceived the named dowry and children are connected but the \ncouple do inherit from one another if one dies before it is nullified \nbecause the contract was unsound and she is always forbidden to \nhim. When there is only a contract which it is nullified, she is not \nforever forbidden and he can marry her after the „Idda is he \nwishes.  \n \n32.4e Marriage contracts containing uncertainty  \n \nas is any marriage involving uncertainty (gharar) in either \nthe terms of the contract or the amount of the dowry or \nany marriage in which the dowry includes anything whose \nsale is forbidden \n  \nLike marriage by choice, or where the dowry consists of an \nrunaway slave or runaway camel, or if the dowry is unlawful, like \nwine and pigs. If anyone of that occurs, then it is invalid before \nconsummation and she has no dowry. It is established after it with \nthe dowry of a women like her.  \n \n32.4f When there is a defect in the marriage  \n \nAny marriage which is invalid because of some defect in \nthe dowry should be dissolved before the consummation \ntakes place. However, if the marriage is consummated, it is \nconsidered valid and the man should then pay the dowry \nappropriate to the circumstances of the woman he has \nmarried \n  \nLike a marriage for what cannot be lawfully owned, like wine, or \nis permitted but not valid to sell, like a runaway slave. It should \nbe dissolved by divorce with no dowry. If she has taken it, she \nreturns it. If it is consummated, and only discovered afterwards, \nshe receives a suitable dowry for someone of her deen and lineage.  \n \n32.4g Defective marriage contracts after consummation  \n \nIf it is the contract that is defective but the marriage is not \ndissolved until after it has been consummated, the \nspecified dowry must be paid and any marriage bars \n(muharim) that would have applied if the marriage had \nbeen valid, still apply \n  \nThis is like a marriage without a guardian which is invalid before \nand after consummation. If it is voided before consummation, \nthere is no dowry. But if it has been, a specified dowry is paid or a \nsuitable dowry. When an invalid marriage is nullified, the bars to \nmarriage formed by it are still binding. just as would have been \nthe case in a valid marriage. If the marriage is nullified before \nconsummation, these bars do not occur unless some of the \npreliminaries to intercourse have taken place, like kissing and \nembracing.  \n \n32.4h Fake marriage does not permit remarriage  \n \nNor does such a marriage make it possible for a man to \nremarry a woman whom he has previously divorced with a \ntriple divorce \n  \ni.e. through an unsound marriage after it is agreed that it is \nunsound, even if intercourse occurs several times. As for a \nmarriage whose validity is disputed and she is divorced after \nconfirmed intercourse, then she is lawful based on the evidence of \nwhether there is intercourse or not. It achieves imposing bars \nagainst intercourse without making marriage lawful to be careful \non either side.  \n \n32.4i It does not entail being muhsan \n  \nNor do the two parties involved attain 'muhsan' status \n  \nBecause one of the preconditions of becoming lawful and muhsan \nis the validity of the contract. The correct position is that the \ncouple do not achieve muhsan status through an invalid marriage \nas we read in at-Tahqiq.  \n \n32.5 Forbidden degrees  \n \n32.5a Unlawful through blood relationship  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has made it haram to marry seven \ncategories of women through blood relationship and seven \nthrough suckling and marriage relationship. He says, may \nHe be exalted, \"Haram for you are your mothers and your \ndaughters and your sisters and your father's sisters and \nyour mother's sisters and your brother's daughters and \nyour sister's daughters.\" These are the ones who are haram \nthrough blood relationship \n  \n32.5b Unlawful through suckling or marriage relationship  \n \nThose who are haram through suckling or marriage \nrelationship are, as Allah azza wa jall says: \"Your mothers \nwho have suckled you and your sisters through suckling \n  \nThis applies whether the nurse is a virgin or non-virgin, even if \nnot yet of puberty, and even if it is a hermaphrodite, alive or dead, \nwhen there is milk in the breasts. The suckling can be once or \nseveral times. Mothers and sisters are the only two mentioned in \nthe Holy Qur'an: one is the root and one the branch to indicate \nthat it encompasses all.  \n \n32.5c Wives' mothers  \n \nyour wives' mothers \n  \nEvery woman who has a connection by birth to the wife, however \nhigh, whether he made a contract with her when he was adult or \nyoung. The majority of the people of knowledge say that it is \ngeneral whether or not the marriage was consummated. A \nmarriage contract with the daughter makes her mother unlawful. \nOther people like 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and ibn 'Abbas \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) say that \"those you have gone into\" is a \nprecondition for this and the step-daughter. According to their \nschool, when a man marries a woman and divorces her before \nconsummation, he can marry her mother.  \n \n32.5d Step-daughters  \n \nyour step-daughters living in your households, if you have \nconsummated your marriage with their mothers - if you \nhave not consummated it there is no harm in marrying \nthem \n  \nStepdaughters are the wife's daughter. No consensus about that is \nunderstood except what is related from 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nthat she is not unlawful when she is in the household. There is \ndisagreement \nabout \nconsummation. \nImam \nash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is intercourse while Shaikh al-\nBaydawi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it means to go behind a \ncurtain with them which is a well-known allusion to intercourse. \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it means enjoyment with touching, \nkissing, even if nothing happens from that.  \n \n32.5e Son's wives  \n \nthe wives of your sons who are born from your loins \n  \nHowever lows whether the marriage was consummated or not. \nThis applies to milk sons as well by agreement, based on what the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said: \"Suckling makes \nunlawful what lineage makes unlawful.\"  \n \n32.5f Two sisters at the same time  \n \nor being married to two sisters at the same time except if it \nhas already happened  \n \nWhether by marriage or ownership of if one is by marriage and \nthe other is a slavegirl. An exception is made regarding what has \nalready happened. If it happened before, and has been removed by \nIslam, Allah azza wa jall excuses it. Islam eliminates it but there \nis no punishment for it.  \n \n32.5g Father's ex-wives \n  \nAnd Allah azza wa jall also says, \"Do not marry any of the \nwomen whom your fathers married \n  \nWhether the marriage has been consummated or not. It is by the \ncontract that she becomes unlawful to the son. It is the same with \nthe ex-wife of the grandfather.  \n \n32.5h Milk causes marriage barriers  \n \nAnd the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) made suckling \nthe same as blood regarding the categories of relationship \nwhich are haram for marriage \n  \nThis is in the two Sahih collections. What birth makes unlawful, \nsuckling makes unlawful. The ayat which indicates the \nprohibition of being married at the same time relatives other than \ntwo sisters and the Sunnah adds further categories. Here he \nindicates here a prohibition made by the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam):  \n \n32.5i Being married to a woman and her aunt  \n \nAnd he also made it haram for a woman to marry a man \nwho is married to any aunt of hers \n  \nIt is transmitted in the Muwatta' and the two Sahih collections. \nThe precise rule is that it applies to every two women between \nwhom there is kinship and suckling which prevents them being \nmarried together, and so it is unlawful to be married to them both \nat the same time. If he is married to both of them, both marriages \nare always null and void, even if he has consummated the \nmarriage, without divorce or dowry for the one whose marriage \nhas not been consummated. If the first woman knows, then the \nsecond marriage is void and the first marriage is confirmed and \nthe marriage of the one who claims she is the second is nullified, \nbut it is by divorce. If the first knows of the second and the \nhusband does not claim knowledge about which marriage was \nfirst, both marriages are void.  \n \n32.5j The contract entails marriage barriers \n  \nWhen a man has married a woman, the existence of the \ncontract \neven \nwithout \nthe \nmarriage \nhaving \nbeen \nconsummated, makes that bride haram for his father and \ngrandfathers and his sons \n  \nThis bar is not based on intercourse. \n  \nIn the same way, the bride's mother and grandmothers \nbecome haram for him \n  \nThis explains the \"mothers of your wives\". By a contract with the \ndaughter, the mother becomes unlawful, whether the marriage is \nconsummated or not.  \n \n32.5k The case of the ex-wife's daughters  \n \nHowever, her daughters are not haram unless either he \nhas had sexual intercourse with her or has experienced \nphysical pleasure from contact with her, as a result of \nhaving married her or owned her as a slavegirl or the same \nthing having happened as a result of a doubtful marriage \nor ownership \n  \nEven by looking at other than her face or hands. In the case of the \ndoubtful marriage, such a contract does not make the daughter \nunlawful. Consummation, intercourse or enjoyment of her makes \nher unlawful. Looking at her face or hands, even with pleasure, \ndoes not. Enjoyment by sound marriage is evident. A case of \ndoubt, for instance, would be when the marriage is a fifth one, or \nshe is in „Idda without him knowing and he enjoys her, or he had \nintercourse with a woman thinking that she is his wife and so all \nthe branches of each of those women mentioned are unlawful for \nhim.  \n \n32.5l The effect of fornication  \n \nZina [fornication or adultery] does not make partners \nharam who would normally be halal \n  \nEven if this is multiple, it does not create the bar either in the root \nor the branch. It is lawful for him to marry her mother or \ndaughter as long as it is not his own daughter, who is unlawful to \nhim. That is the position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) in \nthe Muwatta'. His evident words in the Mudawwana are different \nwhich says: if he fornicates with the mother of his wife or her \ndaughter he should divorce her. Most Shaikhs say that this \ndivorce is mandatory. So what is in the Mudawwana and the \nMuwatta' differ. Most Shaikhs prefer the Muwatta' and it is relied \non because all the companions of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) agree on it except Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Some prefer what is in the Mudawwana since Shaikh ibn \nHabib (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned that Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he had retracted what was in the \nMuwatta' and said that it was unlawful.  \n \n32.6 Intercourse with non-Muslim women  \n \n32.6a Women who are not People of the Book  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has made it haram to have sexual \nintercourse with a kafir woman, not from the People of the \nBook, either through marriage or ownership \n  \nThis is for the Muslim. This is based on the words of Allah azza \nwa jall, \"Do not marry idolatrous women until they believe.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 2:221) Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nthis includes the Magians and Sabaeans who are the people who \ndeviated from Judaism and Christianity and worshipped the \nangels. It includes idolaters who actually worship idols and others \nwho worship other things like the sun and the moon.  \n \n32.6b Women of the People of the Book  \n \nIt is halal to have sexual intercourse with women of the \nPeople of the Book if you own them as slaves or are \nmarried to any of their free women, but it is not halal for \neither a free man or a slave to have sexual intercourse \nwith slave girls from among the people of the Book \nthrough marriage to them \n  \nThis is based on the ayat of Allah azza wa jall, \"or what your right \nhands own.\" We read in adh-Dhakira that because the People of \nthe Book have been honored by the Book and addressed by the \nAlmighty Lord, their women and food are permitted. Others lack \nthis honor by their deprival. It is reported from 'Abdullah ibn \n'Umar ibn al-Khattab (alaihi salat wa salam) that it is not \npermitted to marry a free Kitabi woman by evidence of the ayat of \nSura al-Baqara. He says, \"There is no shirk greater than her \nstatement that her Lord is 'Isa (alaihi salam).\"  \n \n32.7 Marriage to slaves and stepmother's children  \n \nA woman cannot marry her slave, nor her son's slave and a \nman cannot marry his slavegirl nor his son's slavegirl. He \ncan, however, marry his father's slavegirl and his mother's \nslavegirl \n  \nA man is permitted to marry his stepmother's daughter from a \nprevious marriage. \n  \nThis is clear when he had the daughter before the marriage and \nwas weaned. When he married her while she was nursing or the \nfather has divorced her and then she married a man and had a \ngirl, can the daughter of the first husband marry this girl or not. \nThere are three positions in that. The most likely of them is the \nprohibition and dislike out of caution. Then he mentioned the \nreverse of this question.  \n \nAnd a woman can marry her stepmother's son from a \nprevious marriage \n  \nBy other than her father. This is when her father marries her \nafter the child is weaned. If he marries her while she is nursing, \nhe is her step-brother by nursing.  \n \n32.8 Number and condition of wives  \n \nBoth free men and slaves are permitted to marry four free \nwomen whether Muslims or from the People of the Book. \nSlaves can marry four Muslim slave girls and free men can \nalso do this but only if they are afraid of committing zina \nand do not have the means to marry free women \n  \n32.9 A man's duties towards his wives  \n \n32.9a Equal treatment  \n \nA man should treat his wives equally \n  \nA man should be equitable with his wives, whether they are free \nor Muslim slaves or Kitabis. This obligation is indicated by the \nBook, Sunnah and consensus. As for the Book, it is the words of \nthe Almighty, \"But if you are afraid of not treating them equally, \nthen only one,\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:3) i.e. choosing one is a command of \nAllah Almighty to confine oneself to one if you fear injustice. This \nindicates that justice is obligatory. As the for the Sunnah, the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"If someone has two \nwives and is not fair between them, he will come on the Day of \nRising with one side lower than the other. The four Sunan relate \nit and the Community agree that it is obligatory. Whoever is not \nfair between his wives disobeys Allah and His Messenger (alaihi \nsalat wa salam). He is not permitted to be Imam nor is his \ntestimony accepted. The preferred position that he confines \nfairness to the spending the night. As for clothing and \nmaintenance, that is according to the state of each of them: the \nnoble is suitably provided for and the lowly is suitably provided \nfor. There is no obligation in intercourse, but it is forbidden for \nhim to hold back from one in order to be keen towards the other. \nThe division is a day and night or two days if the wives agree.  \n \n32.9b Maintenance and Housing \n  \nHe is responsible for their maintenance and housing to the \nextent that his means allow \n  \nThe husband, free or slave must maintain and provide for his wife, \nfree or slave, Muslim or Kitabi. The literal sense is that it is only \naccording to his situation. The well-known position is that her \nsituation is also observed and so his like spends for her like in \nboth his hardship and ease. It is the same with clothing. He \npermitted to give the price to pay for what he owes. He does not \nhave to eat with her. There is agreement that she can divorce him \nif he is unable to support her after some delay in the well-known \nposition. An opposite position is that he can be divorced without \ndelay which was mentioned by Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). His divorce is not an irrevocable one, even if the judge \nimpose it, but it is not valid for him to take her back unless he \nfinds some wealth which will enable him to be able to support her.  \n \n32.9c Rights towards slave girls  \n \nA man's slave girls and or a slave by whom a man has had a \nchild (umm Walad) are not allotted nights in the same way \nas his wives are \n  \n32.9d When he becomes liable for support  \n \nA man is not liable for maintenance until his marriage has \nbeen \nconsummated, \nor \nhe \nhas \nbeen \ncalled \non \nto \nconsummate his marriage, given that it is with someone \nwith whom sexual intercourse is possible \n  \nWhether she is an orphan or otherwise, free or slave, simply by \nthe contract in the well-known position. Maintenance is obliged by \ntwo things. One is consummation which means they are alone \ntogether whether there is intercourse or not, and whether or not \nshe is someone with whom it is possible to have intercourse since \nshe may have a physical impediment, and the husband is adult \nand they are not supervised. The second thing is when he is \ninvited to consummate it and the husband is adult and they are \nnot ill.  \n \n32.10 Marriage by proxy (tafwid)  \n \n32.10a Definition  \n \nMarriage by proxy is acceptable. This is when the husband \nand the guardian make a contract without mentioning a \ndowry  \n \nWithout dispute. It is related in the singular, i.e. the husband can \nmake it. The words of the author are true in two forms because \nwhen they do not mention the dowry, either they are explicit in \nthat by proxy as when he says, \"I marry you to my ward by proxy \" \nor like \"I have married you to my ward\" without mentioning the \ndowry. In both cases the marriage is valid. If they make an \nexplicit precondition that there is no dowry, then it is not \npermitted and it is invalid before consummation. \n  \n32.10b A dowry must be fixed  \n \nin which case the marriage cannot be consummated until \nthe amount of the dowry has been fixed \n  \nAppropriate to her status on the day of the contract because it \nobliges inheritance and other fixed rights of marriage and entitles \nhim to consummation, not by the contract nor by death. If one of \nthem dies, they inherit from one another. There is no dowry except \nby stipulation. Some of them say it is affirmed by death, but that \nit is weak.  \n \n32.10c Acceptance of the dowry  \n \nIf the stipulated dowry is appropriate to the status of the \nwoman in question she must accept it. However if it is less \nthan her due the choice is hers. If she does not want to \naccept it, the couple are separated \n  \nWhen the dowry is appropriate to her in the School, she must \naccept it. If it is less than the suitable dowry, as when he \nstipulates 50 dinars when a suitable dowry is 100, then she can \nchoose. If she is satisfied and is sane and a non-virgin, she can \nmake it binding as long as it is not less than a quarter of a dinar. \nIf she is not pleased with it, then they are separated with a final \ndivorce because it is before consummation.  \n \n32.10d When the dowry is suitable  \n \nIf she is satisfied with it, or if the husband makes the \namount to what is appropriate, then the marriage is \nbinding on her \n  \nBy adding more to what was stipulated when it did not reach a \nsuitable dowry, and he allots her a proper amount after allotting \nless, then it is binding.  \n \n32.11 Effects of Change of Religion  \n \n32.11a If one of them leaves Islam  \n \nIf either one of a married couple leaves Islam, their \nmarriage is invalidated and they automatically become \ndivorced \n  \nThis is by a statement of disbelief or entering another religion. It \nbecomes immediately invalid and there is a final divorce in the \nfamous position, i.e. it is invalid by divorce. If the apostate \nbecomes Muslim, then the marriage remains and there is no need \nfor a contract nor taking back because the tie still exists. If he is \nkilled while an apostate, the spouse does not inherit. If someone \nwho is not an adult apostasies, they agree that he is only killed \nafter becoming adult and being asked to repent. Because one takes \nnote of his apostasy, his slaughtered animal is not eaten and the \nprayer is not said over him.  \n \n32.11b Another opinion  \n \nalthough \nanother \nopinion \nis \nthat \nthe \nmarriage \nis \ninvalidated but no actual divorce takes place \n  \nAnother position is that the marriage is invalid without divorce, \nwhich is transmitted from ibn Abi Uways (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and \nIbn al-Majishun (radhi‟Allahu anhu). They are compelled to \nabrogate it by the words of the Almighty,\" Do not hold to the bond \nof the unbelievers,\" (Holy Qur‟an 60:10) i.e. there should be not \nbond or marital connection between them.  \n \n32.11c When a couple become Muslim  \n \nIf a non-Muslim couple both become Muslim their marriage \nremains valid \n  \nThis is whether they are Kitabis or others if they become Muslim \nbefore or after consummation, whether the marriage was with a \nguardian and dowry or not. The marriage is valid as long as there \nis no impediment, like lineage or milk. If there is such an \nimpediment then the marriage is invalid.  \n \n32.11d When only one person in a couple become Muslim \n  \nIf one of the couple becomes a Muslim, the marriage is \nautomatically invalidated, but no actual divorce takes \nplace \n  \nThis invalidation is without divorce in the famous position. They \ndescribe this question in its various forms. One of them is that the \nhusband is married to a Magian or the like who is not one of the \nPeople of the Book and he becomes Muslim and she does not soon \nafter, i.e. within a month. If the time is not long between the two \nof them becoming Muslim, like a month, the marriage is confirmed \nwhether it has been consummated or not.  \n \n32.11e When the wife becomes Muslim  \n \nIf the woman becomes a Muslim, her previous husband has \nthe first claim on her if he becomes a Muslim during her \n‘Idda period \n  \nIf she is a Kitabi or otherwise when the marriage has been \nconsummated. This is true even if he divorces her in the „Idda, as \nthe divorce of the unbeliever is not considered. If he becomes \nMuslim after the end of the „Idda, the marriage is not confirmed \nfor her because his Islam is like the revocable divorce and there is \nnot taking back after the end of the „Idda. If she becomes Muslim \nbefore her husband and the marriage has not been consummated, \nthen their situation is clear.  \n \n32.11f When the man becomes Muslim  \n \nIf the man becomes a Muslim and the woman is one of the \nPeople of the Book, their marriage remains valid \n  \nIf he becomes Muslim before her and she is one of the People of \nthe Book, the marriage is confirmed as long as there is no \nimpediment to its continuance like lineage or suckling or if he \nmarried her in „Idda, whether his Islam was before consummation \nor not.  \n \n32.11g If the woman is a Magian  \n \nIf the woman is a fire-worshipper (Magian) and becomes a \nMuslim straight after her husband, they remain married. If \nthere is a delay in her accepting Islam, separation takes \nplace \n  \nIf he becomes Muslim immediately as long as there is no \nimpediment. If she delays, they are separated. What the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) says differs to what is in the Mukhtasar, \nwhich is that if she becomes Muslims after her husband without it \nbeing a long time between their becoming Muslim, the marriage is \nconfirmed. \"Near\" is defined as a month and the like.  \n \n32.11h Someone with more than four wives  \n \nIf an idolater who has more than four wives becomes a \nMuslim he must select four of them and separate from the \nrest  \n \nFour of those he is permitted to marry in Islam before or after \nconsummation, whether he had a multiple contract or several \ncontracts with them, whether they are first or last, whether they \nbecome Muslim with him or he becomes Muslim and they are \nKitabis. Choice is explicit. After the choice he is separated from \nthe others without divorce. The point of the dispute is that if he \nbecomes Muslim with ten wives he chooses four and separates \nfrom the rest.  \n \n32.12 Various impediments  \n \n32.12a Divorce by Li'an  \n \nIf someone divorces his wife by a curse (li'an) he can never \nmarry her again \n  \nHe adds in the Muwatta', \"If he denies himself, he is flogged with \nthe hadd and the child connected to him, but he cannot take her \nback.\"  \n \n32.12b Marriage during ‘Idda  \n \nThe same applies to a man who marries a woman during \nher ‘Idda period and consummates the marriage during it \n  \nNo matter what kind of „Idda it is. We limit the „Idda to being for a \nrevocable divorce because if he marries a finally divorced woman, \nand she is unlawful to the husband, it is abrogated and there is a \nhadd but she is not forever unlawful to him.  \n \n32.12c Marriage of slaves  \n \nIt is not permitted for a slave or a slavegirl to marry unless \ntheir master gives permission \n  \n32.12d Women not making a marriage contract  \n \nIt is not permitted for a woman, or a slave, or a non-Muslim \nto draw up a woman's marriage contract \n  \nBeing male, free and Muslim are preconditions for the validity of \nthe contract since the women is not permitted to undertake the \ncontract for herself let alone another woman. The unbeliever has \nno authority over a Muslim woman although he does over an \nunbelieving woman and can marry her to a Muslim or unbeliever.  \n \n32.12e Marriage to make re-marriage possible  \n \nIt is not permitted for a man to marry a woman in order to \nmake it halal for her to remarry a man who has previously \ndivorced her by a triple divorce \n  \nThis is when the motive for marriage to make re-marriage lawful, \nor he has that intention along with the intention of keeping her if \nhe likes her. What is considered is the intention at the time of the \ncontract. If that intention occurs at the time of consummation \nhere is no harm. This is based on the words of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam), \"Shall I tell you about the borrowed Billy-\ngoat'?\" They said, \"Yes, Rasulullah.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"That is one who makes a woman lawful.\" Then he (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Allah has cursed the one who makes a \nwoman lawful and the one for whom he makes her lawful.\" (ad-\nDaraqutni) He likens him to an animal and then he (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said that Allah cursed the two men for what they did in \nmaking her lawful for her ex-husband. \n  \nand if such a marriage did take place it would not make a \nremarriage of this kind valid  \n \nThat is because this type of marriage is void before and after \nconsummation Some of them make a distinction between a final \ndivorce with consummation and a suitable dowry. If the first \nmarries her with this marriage, it is invalid without divorce and \nthe husband, guardian, witnesses and wife are punished for \ncarrying a marriage designed to make re-marriage lawful.  \n \n32.12f Ihram precludes marriage  \n \nA man in a state of ihram can neither get married himself \nnor draw up a marriage contract for someone else \n  \nWhether it is hajj or 'umra. This is because it is valid that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The person in ihram \ndoes not marry or give in marriage nor propose.\" If there is \nmarriage or giving in marriage, it is always invalid before \nconsummation and so she receives nothing. If it is abrogated after \nit, she has the dowry because every woman with a consummated \nmarriage receives dowry.  \n \n32.13 Sickness  \n \n32.13a Serious illness precludes marriage, but the dowry is \npaid from the third  \n \nIt is not permitted for a man with a very serious illness to \nget married but if he does get married and consummates \nthe marriage, then his bride's dowry is the first thing to be \npaid from the third of his wealth he is permitted to leave \nas he wills \n  \nOr for a sick woman which may prove fatal. That is because he is \nrestricted in respect of his property and it is connected to all who \nhas a lien on it absolutely. It is clear that the marriage of a \nseriously ill person is not allowed, even if he needs a woman to \nlook after him. It is like that in one of the two famous positions. \nThe other position is that it is permissible on account of need. The \nmarriage is void before and after consummation.  \n \nThe preferred position is that it is nullified by divorce because \nthere is disagreement on it. If it is not consummated, she has \nnothing. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that the \nwoman whose marriage is consummated receives a suitable \ndowry. It is the position of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is clear \nthat she has the stipulated dowry, even if it is more than the \ndowry of a woman like her, from the capital, little or great.  \n \n32.13b Such a wife does not receive a fixed share  \n \nShe does not receive the fixed share of his estate which \nwould normally go to a wife \n  \nThis comes from the prohibition by the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) against bringing in a new heir or removing one, and to \nact other contrary to its aim.  \n \n32.13c Divorce when ill  \n \nIf such a man divorces a wife, that divorce is binding on \nhim, but, if he dies from his illness, his wife still inherits \nfrom him \n  \nIt is divorce because he is sane and responsible, whether the \ndivorce is final or revocable. She does not inherit from him if the \ndivorce is treble. She inherits from him if its revocable as long as \nthe „Idda is not over. If he recovers from his illness and falls ill \nagain, she does not inherit from him because the restriction was \nremoved by health.  \n \nThis chapter is continued in the next page which deals with \ndivorce, 'Dhihar'-repudiation, (ila') vows of celibacy within \nmarriage, mutual cursing (li'an), 'Khul'-'divorce, and suckling.  \n \n(Continuation of Chapter 32)  \n \nDivorce, 'Dhihar'-repudiation, vows of celibacy within \nmarriage (ila'), mutual cursing (li'an), 'Khul'-'divorce, and \nsuckling  \n \n \nThe discussion on divorce begins. Linguistically it means \nreleasing, from your words, \"I released the camel,\" and it is a \ntechnical term for undoing the bond of marriage. It has four \npillars:  \n \nHusband  \n \nWife  \n \nIntention. If someone speaks of divorce without intention it does \nnot occur, i.e. if someone wants to speak about something else and \nhis tongue becomes tied and he utters divorce, that has no effect. \nIt is the same when someone is forced to divorce: unless he uses a \ndouble-entendre with full knowledge.  \n \nThe form, which is divided into the explicit, which has the \nexpression \"divorce\" and it does not require an intention, and into \nallusion, which can be explicit or probable. If it is probable, then \nhis claim about his intention and number is accepted. When, for \ninstance, he says, \"Go\" or \"Leave,\" and says that he did not intend \ndivorce by that. He swears to that and owes nothing. If he says, \"I \nintended divorce by that,\" it is binding. If he intended one or more \ndivorce, he acts by that. If he did not intend a number, three is \nobliged.  \n \nThe Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) divided divorce into two \ncategories: innovated and Sunnah.  \n \n32.14 Divorce  \n \n32.14a Result of divorce  \n \nIf anyone divorces his wife by a triple divorce she is no \nlonger halal for him either by right of ownership or \nmarriage until she has married another husband \n  \nFree or slave, Muslim or Kitabi, consummated or not. This is \nbased on the Qur'anic ayat. What is meant by marriage by the \nShaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) and in the ayat is intercourse which \nis indicated by the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) in the hadith about the wife of Rifa'a (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \n\"Not until you taste his sweetness and he tastes yours.\"  \n \nA precondition for the husband is that he is a Muslim. If he had \nbeen a Muslim married to a Jew or Christian and he divorces his \nwife three times and then she then marries a Jew or a Christian \nwho then divorces her, she is not lawful for the Muslim to marry.  \n \nHe must be an adult and maturity in intercourse is considered. If \nthe contract is made before maturity and there is no \nconsummation until he is an adult, then it is lawful. Intercourse \nduring menstruation or „Idda is not considered, nor is the \nintercourse of the one who makes lawful without mutual aversion \nin it and that there be a customary being alone together which is \nconfirmed by two women.  \n \nThe seclusion must be confirmed, Otherwise, she is not lawful. \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"even if the second \nconfirms the intercourse because they are suspected of doing this \nto allow re-marriage to the one who divorced her. \" Intercourse \nwith an unconscious woman or madwoman is not considered.  \n \n32.14b Triple divorce is an innovation  \n \nIt is an innovation (bid'a) to divorce a wife by a triple \ndivorce said on one occasion but if it happens it is \nnevertheless binding \n  \nThe command is contrary to that even though it did occur in the \ntime of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Part of that is \nthat he (alaihi salat wa salam) heard that a man had divorced his \nwife with three divorces together. He (alaihi salat wa salam) got \nup in anger and then said, \"Do you play with the Book of Allah \nazza wa jall while I am among you?\" However it is binding when it \nis done all at once.  \n \n32.14c Sunnah divorce  \n \nA Sunnah divorce is acceptable, which is when a man \ndivorces his wife by one pronouncement made while she is \npure, having not had sexual intercourse with her since she \nbecame pure and does not make a second pronouncement \nuntil her ‘Idda period is over \n  \nA divorce allowed by the Sunnah which is permitted is described. \nThis has four rules.  \n \nIf one of them is missing it is not Sunnah.  \n \n32.14d When he can take her back  \n \nHe can go back to her provided that she has not begun her \nthird menstrual period since the pronouncement of \ndivorce (assuming she has menstrual periods and is a free \nwoman). If the wife is a slavegirl who has menstrual \nperiods, he can go back to her provided she has not yet \nbegun her second period \n  \nHe can take her back because the marital ties continue between \nthem except for intercourse. Taking her back is with the intention \nand the statement, like \"I take her back,\" \"I keep her,\" or things \nwhich take the place of word like intercourse and foreplay, but \nthere must be an intention with the intercourse. Intercourse \nwithout the intention is not taking back.  \n \n32.14e If the wife does not menstruate \n  \nIf the wife has not yet begun to have menstrual periods or \nhas ceased to have them, he can divorce her at any time he \nwants and the same applies to a woman who is pregnant \n  \nVarious ages are given for the menopause. About \"any time,\" \nShaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It can even be after \nintercourse with her because such a divorce is in months which \nwould not entail lengthening the „Idda. It is the same with the \nwife with whom the marriage has not been consummated, even \nduring the time of her menstruation, since the reason for the \nprohibition is to avoid prolonging „Idda.  \n \n32.14f If the wife is pregnant  \n \nA man can go back to his pregnant wife up until the time \nshe gives birth, in the same way that he can go back to a \nwife who is having periods before the end of her ‘Idda \n  \nHe can take her back when the child is partially born. If it is \ncompletely born, then the „Idda is over and he cannot take her \nback. The „Idda ends by the miscarriage of a piece of flesh or a clot. \nIf the matter is unclear, and it is not known whether it was the \nfetus or congealed blood, one considers the hot liquid. The „Idda of \na woman with constant bleeding is a year: nine months are \nconsidered as freeing her and three are the „Idda. So the „Idda is \nactually three months. The „Idda of the post-menopausal woman is \nthree months. There is no difference in the „Idda of months \nbetween the free woman and slave.  \n \nThey disagree about whether \"period\" in the ayat means purity, as \nwith \nus \nand \nImam \nash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nor \nmenstruation with Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n32.14g Divorce during menstruation  \n \nIt is forbidden for a man to divorce his wife while she is \nmenstruating but if he does do so it is valid, but he is \ncompelled to take her back if her ‘Idda period has not \nfinished \n  \ni.e. she is not pregnant. If he does, it is binding because Abdullah \nibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) divorced his wife while she was \nmenstruating and as 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) about that and he (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Tell him to take her back and then keep her until \nshe is pure and then menstruates and then is pure. Then if he \nwishes he can keep her, or if he wishes he can divorce her before \ntouching her. That is the „Idda which Allah azza wa jall has \ncommanded for the divorce of women.\" The ruler commands him \nto take her back. If he refuses, he threatens him with prison. If he \nrefuses, he is imprisoned. If he refuses he is beaten.  \n \nMukhtasar: The same applies if he divorces her during lochia.  \n \n32.14h An unconsummated marriage  \n \nIf a man has not yet consummated his marriage he can \ndivorce his wife at any time  \n \nHe is permitted to do this in the famous position since she has no \n„Idda, but Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) forbids it in \nmenstruation because he considers the reason behind the ruling to \nbe an act of worship.  \n \n32.14i Results of pronouncing divorce  \n \nOne pronouncement of divorce ends the marriage and \nthree makes her haram for him until she has been married \nto someone else \n  \nWithout consummation because she has no „Idda. It is final. Three \nin one statement or what is like it is like the final or by repeating \nthe expression one after another.  \n \n32.14j The statement, \"You are divorced\"  \n \nIf a man says, \"You are divorced,\" to his wife that is \nconsidered one pronouncement unless he intended more \nthan that \n  \nIt is a clear explicit statement, and counts, even if it is a joke. If he \nuses an indirect term (\"You are free\"), divorce is only obliged by \nintention because it is an allusion. If he intends more, it is \nbinding.   \n \n32.15 Khul' Divorce  \n \nKhul' is a type of divorce which precludes any possibility \nof remarriage, even though it is not technically called a \ndivorce, and it takes place when the husband accepts \nsomething from his wife in return for her release \n  \n\"It is a divorce\" refutes the one who says that it is invalidation. \nAccordingly to the first, if he divorced her before, the khul' is two \ndivorces and is she is only lawful after another marriage. \nAccording to the second, he can take her back before she married. \nThe words \"no possibility of remarriage\" indicates the position of \nsomeone who thinks it is revocable and not final. He said, \"not \ntechnically a divorce\" indicates the one who says the khul' is not \ndivorce even though it is called divorce.  \n \n32.16 Formulas of divorce  \n \nIf anyone says to his wife, \"You are divorced once and for \nall,\" it is as if he had pronounced the triple divorce, \nregardless of whether the marriage has been consummated \nor not \n  \nSimilarly, if anyone says, \"You are no longer my \nresponsibility,\" or \"You are on your own,\" or \"You are \nharam for me,\" or \"Your rein is on your hump\" (i.e. you can \ngo wherever you like) that is also considered as a triple \ndivorce if the marriage has been consummated. If the \nmarriage has not been consummated the husband is asked \nto specify what he intended \n  \nOne takes note of custom in all this.  \n \n32.17 Rights of divorced women  \n \n32.17a Dowry in unconsummated marriages  \n \nWhen a woman who has been previously married is \ndivorced before the marriage has been consummated she \nreceives half her dowry unless she chooses of her own free \nwill to forgo it. If she is a virgin the decision is left to her \nfather and in the case of a slavegirl it is left to her master \n  \nWhich has been named for her by the words of the Almighty \"If \nyou divorce them before you have touched them but have already \nallotted them a dowry, they should have half the amount you \nallotted, unless they forgo it,\" meaning non-virgin sane women, \"or \nthe one in charge of the marriage contract forgoes it.,\"(Holy \nQur‟an 2:237) which is the father in his virgin daughter and the \nmaster in his slavegirl. This applies when the divorce is final or \nrevocable, and she is free or a Kitabi or a Muslim slave, \nconsummated or not.  \n \n32.17b A gift from the husband to the divorced wife  \n \nWhen a man divorces his wife it is recommended for him to \ngive her something by way of consolation although this is \nnot obligatory \n  \nA gift according to his situation, wealthy or not. He is not \ncompelled to do it, but it is recommended.  \n \n31.17c When the gift is not needed  \n \nIf the marriage has not been consummated but the dowry \nhas been paid, nothing need be given by way of consolation  \n \nShe has no gift because she takes half of the dowry while her \ngoods remain. It is understood that this is when she has no \nallotment, she has a gift, as we said.  \n \n31.17d In a khul' divorce  \n \nThe same thing applies when a woman asks or a khul' \ndivorce \n  \nBecause she paid some of her property to separate from her \nhusband, disliked or not. \n  \n32.18 Right of widows in a tafwid marriage  \n \n32.18a In an unconsummated tafwid marriage \n \nIf a man dies without having either paid over the dowry or \nconsummated his marriage, his wife receives her share of \nhis estate but does not receive any dowry \n  \nThis is agreed because us the contract of marriage if sound, it \nmakes inheritance between them sound. But she has no dowry in \nthe famous position. What is understood is that it is the same if he \nhas allotted her a dowry.  \n \n32.18b In a consummated tafwid marriage  \n \nIf the marriage has been consummated she should receive \na dowry appropriate for someone of her status if no \nparticular amount has been agreed beforehand \n  \nWhen he has not allotted her any dowry. She also inherits. This is \nbecause her goods are sold and so she has a suitable dowry. This is \nwhen she is sane and it permitted to agree to less than a suitable \ndowry.  \n \n32.19 Physical grounds for annulment  \n \n32.19a Physical grounds in respect of the bride  \n \nThe marriage contract can be annulled if a bride is found \nto be mad or suffering from leprosy or a disease of the \nvagina. If the man consummates his marriage to such a \nwoman in ignorance he must pay her dowry and then \nclaim it back from her father. The same applies if it was \nthe bride's brother who acted as her marriage guardian \n  \nThese are faults. A disease of the vagina is a blockage which \nprevents intercourse. There are various forms of this. It includes \nconstant vaginal bleeds which prevent full intercourse. A bad \nsmell from the vagina is another cause. If the marriage is \nconsummated, then he pays her dowry and seeks it from the \nfather.  \n \n32.19b A consequence of this  \n \nIf the marriage guardian is not one of her close relatives, \nthe man does not have to pay any previously agreed dowry, \nbut instead the bride receives only a quarter of a dinar (i.e. \nthe minimum possible dowry) \n  \nIf he is a cousin, and does not know about the fault and the \nmarriage is consummated, he owes nothing. If he knows about the \nfault, then he is liable for it like the relative. He does not have any \ncomeback against the distant relative, but the woman only has a \nquarter of a dinar.  \n \n32.19c Impotence  \n \nAn impotent man is allowed one year and if he is still not \ncapable of having intercourse the marriage can be \ndissolved if the wife so wishes \n  \nIf he has not had intercourse because the impediment preceded \nand followed the contract. If he has had intercourse, and then that \nimpediment occurs and he manages intercourse there is no \ndivorce. If he claims intercourse and she denies it, his statement is \ntaken when he swears to it. If he refuses, she swears and her word \nis taken. This is if she wishes a final divorce because every divorce \nmade by the qadi is final except in the case of someone who is \nunable to provide for his wife.  \n \n32.20 A missing husband  \n \n32.20a Period of Waiting  \n \nIf a man disappears his wife should wait four years from \nthe day she brings the matter to the notice of the \nappropriate authority \n  \nThis is when he is missing in the land of Islam, and has no known \nplace in a place of famine or wildness when he has a wife and she \nrefers her business to the ruler to investigate his news for him. If \nhe is free, then the period is four years. If he is a slave, it is two \nyears. The time begins from when the case is presented to the \nauthorities.  \n \n32.20b The ‘Idda after the waiting period  \n \nWhen this period of time has elapsed she should observe \nthe same ‘Idda period as a woman whose husband has died. \nThen she may remarry if she wishes to  \n \nAnd she must observe mourning according to the famous position. \nAfter that she can marry and does not require the permission of \nthe ruler to marry.  \n \n32.20c His inheritance  \n \nThe wealth of such a man is not distributed as inheritance \nuntil such a time has passed that he could no longer be \nreasonably supposed to be alive \n  \nGenerally this is the age of eighty. The author (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh al-Qabisi (rahmatullahi alaihi) choose it. \nShaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) chose seventy.  \n \n32.21 During the ‘Idda period  \n \nA woman may not be asked for in marriage during her \n‘Idda period although there is no harm in an indirect \nsuggestion being made provided it is done in an acceptable \nway \n  \nNo matter the reason for the „Idda. This means it is haram. When \nshe is in „Idda not from divorce, it is not haram since it is not \nthree. It is also unlawful to promise marriage from one of two \nsides so that she is certain of it. It is permissible to allude it so \nthat an intention is known.  \n \n32.22 Newly-wed  \n \nA man who marries a virgin can spend seven consecutive \nnights with her, overriding the rights of any other wives \nfor that period. If the woman has previously been married \nthe period is three nights \n  \nYoung or old, Muslim, Kitabi or slave. After this period the \ndivision begins.  \n \n32.23 Forbidden degrees among slave girls  \n \nIf a man has two slave girls who are sisters he may not \nhave sexual intercourse with both of them. If, having had \nsexual intercourse with one of them, he desires to have \nsexual intercourse with the other, he must separate \nhimself from the first, making her haram for himself, by \neither selling her or making an arrangement with her to \nbuy her freedom [kitaba] or by setting her free or by any \nother means by which she would become haram for him \n  \nOr any other forms of sexual pleasure. If he owns both, he has \nintercourse with one but refrains from other. If he wants to have \nintercourse with the other, he must made the first unlawful for \nhimself, either after the istibra' by selling her. If the sale is not \nfinal, like the sell with an option, the first woman is not unlawful \nto him until the end of the days of the option. Other possibilities \nare kitaba.  \n \n32.23a Consequences of intercourse  \n \nIf a man has had sexual intercourse with one of his slave \ngirls, her mother and daughters become haram for him and \nshe also becomes haram for his father and sons as is the \ncase in marriage \n  \nThis is based on analogy.  \n \n32.24 Divorce by a slave, minor or wife  \n \nA \nslave \ncan \ndivorce \nwithout \ngetting \nhis \nmaster's \npermission. A child, however, cannot divorce \n  \n \n32.24a Divorce by a wife \n \nA woman whose husband has given her the authority to \ndivorce or the option to do so as long as the two are in the \nsame meeting \n  \nIn the meeting she must clearly state her choice. The woman with \nauthority may have authority for one or more divorce. \n  \n32.24b Sort of right of divorce  \n \nThe husband may deny the right of other than a single \ndivorce. If she has the option, it can only be a triple \ndivorce and he does not have the night to deny it \n  \nExcept for the option. This cannot be denied whether the marriage \nis consummated or not.  \n \n32.25 Ila': The Oath of Abstinence  \n \n32.25a Definition of the ila'  \n \nA man who swears not to have intercourse for more than \nfour months is considered to have pronounced an ila' \n  \nThis is whether the woman is Muslim, Kitabi or slave, intending \nharm by that. The period begins from the date of the oath, if it is \nexplicit, or from the day of stopping, and the judgment is that it is \nan oath which applies to less than the term, like the \"I will not \nhave intercourse with you until Zayd comes,\" and if it four months \nor less, it is not an ila'.  \n \n32.25b When the ila' becomes effective  \n \nThe divorce is only implemented after the end of the ila': \nwhich is four months if the man is free and two months if \nhe is a slave. Then the ruler gives him an ultimatum. If he \nresumes marital relations, then the ila' is canceled \n  \nThis is the famous position that there is no divorce until the end of \nthe term of ila'. It is the famous position that the ruler gives him \nan ultimatum to resume relations or divorce. If he resumes, then \nthe judgment of the 'ila' is removed by the words of the Almighty, \n\"If they resume Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Merciful,\" (Holy Qur‟an \n2:226) and resumption is achieved by the glans disappearing into \nthe vagina. If he does not resume, then the ruler commands him to \ndivorce. If he refuses, then the divorce is forced on him by the \nruler.  \n \n32.26 The Dhihar Divorce  \n \n32.26a Expiation of the Dhihar  \n \nIf someone pronounces a dhihar (a statement that sex with \nher is tantamount to incest) then he may not have \nintercourse with her until he expiates that by freeing a \nbelieving slave free of faults who is not partially owned by \nothers or in the process of obtaining freedom. If he cannot \ndo that, then he must fast two consecutive months. If he is \nunable to do that, he should feed sixty poor people two \nmudds each \n  \nFree or slave Muslim. He cannot have intercourse with her or kiss \nor touch her or look at her hair until he expiates for it. The \nmonths are lunar months which are counted by the moon. If he \nbreaks it, he starts anew because it must be continuous. If he \ncannot do that, then he feeds free Muslims. The slave is not fed for \nexpiation unless his master gives permission.  \n \n32.26b No intercourse until he done expiation  \n \nHe may not have intercourse with her night or day until \nthe end of the expiation. If does so, he must repent to Allah \nazza wa jall \n  \nHowever he does not have any other expiation. \n  \nIf he has intercourse after doing part of the expiation by \nfeeding or fasting, he starts it over again  \n \n32.26c Slaves freed in expiation  \n \nThere is no harm in freeing a one-eyed slave in the dhihar \nor a bastard. A child is sufficient, but we think it better to \nfree someone who fasts and prays \n  \nOr any other slave. The Malikis think it better, as opposed to a \nnursing child. He should support the freed child until he is able to \nearn.  \n \n32.27 The Li'an divorce  \n \n32.27a Definition of li'an  \n \nThe li'an divorce between a couple is when the man denies \npaternity provided that he claims that he has been apart \nfrom her since her last menstrual period or by actually \nwitnessing adultery, like a kohl stick in its case \n  \nThe li'an is an allowance made by the Book and Sunnah. There is \nno disagreement about it among the Imams. It takes place \nbetween a couple, even if their marriage is void, consummated or \nnot, or rather they are iniquitous as Shaikh ibn al-Mawwaz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) states. If someone marries a relative or his \nsister unknowingly and she becomes pregnant and he denies the \nchild, they curse each other because it appeared to be a marriage. \nIf she refuses, she receives the hadd. If he refuses, he receives the \nhadd for slander and the child is connected to him. It is a \nprecondition that the husband be a legally responsible Muslim \nwho can have intercourse. For the wife, there is a precondition \nthat she be one who can become pregnant. Neither Islam nor \nfreedom are preconditions. There can be a li'an from a Kitabi or \nslavegirl.  \n \nShe must have menstruated, even once. A similar case is when he \nclaims that he has not had intercourse with her after she had \ngiven birth previously this denied pregnancy. There must be a \nperiod between the two pregnancies which would make them \nseparate: that is six months or more. Or it is actually witnessing \nadultery. A precondition for the li'an in denying paternity is \nimmediacy. If he sees it and is silent and then takes a stand after \nthat, there is no li'an. A precondition for the li'an is actual and not \nhaving intercourse with her afterwards. If there is a delay there is \nno li'an for adultery.  \n \n32.27b Li'an in slander  \n \nThere is disagreement about whether li'an in the case of \nslander is allowed \n  \nWithout the claim of seeing intercourse or denying paternity in \ntwo famous positions, One is that he enacts the li'an and the other \nis that he receives the hadd and cannot enact the li'an.  \n \nFour rulings are connected to the li'an. He indicates one of them:  \n \n32.27c Li'an precludes pre-marriage  \n \nIf they divorce by li'an, they can never remarry \n  \nThe other three judgments is that there is no hadd punishment, \npaternity is denied and the marriage is ended. The separation \nbetween them occurs when the li'an is finished. It does not require \nthe judgment of a judge. It is abrogation, not divorce in the famous \nposition.  \n \n32.27d How the husband carries out the li'an  \n \nThe husband begins the li'an by testifying four times by \nAllah azza wa jall and then the fifth time he curses himself  \n \nIn the li'an. To deny paternity, he says, \"I testify by Allah that this \nchild is not mine\" four times. Shaikh al-Mawwaz (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that it is what is in the Mudawwana. It is the well-\nknown position that he says, \"I testify by Allah that she has \ncommitted adultery.\" If saw her, he says, \"I testify by Allah that I \nsaw her commit adultery.\" The fifth time he says that the curse of \nAllah is on him if he is one of the liars.  \n \n32.27e How the woman carries it out  \n \nThen she does the same four times, and the fifth invokes \nAllah's anger, as Allah azza wa jall has mentioned [in the \nHoly Qur'an 24:6-9] \n  \nShe denies the husband's oath, and when he states that he denies \npaternity and testifies by Allah azza wa jall that she committed \nadultery, she rejects that and says four times, \"I testify by Allah \nthat I have not committed fornication.\" When he says that he saw \nher and swears by Allah that he saw her fornicate, she refutes \nthat and say four times, \"He did not see me fornicate.\" The fifth \ntime she invokes the anger of Allah azza wa jall on her if he is \ntelling the truth.  \n \nThe li'an must take place in the presence of a group of people, with \na minimum of four and be in the highest place in the land. It only \ntakes place in the masjid. It is recommended that it be after the \n'Asr prayer and it is recommended to alarm them both, \nparticularly at the fifth oath and ]to tell them. \"This fifth oath will \noblige the punishment for you.\"  \n \n32.27f If the wife refuses to testify \n  \nIf the wife refuses to testify, she is stoned if she is free and \nmuhsana by intercourse with her husband or another \nhusband. Otherwise, she receives a hundred lashes \n  \nThis is after the husband's curse. There is half the punishment for \na Dhimmî.  \n \n32.27g If the husband refuses to testify  \n \nIf the husband refuses to testify, he is flogged eighty lashes \nfor slander and the child is considered to be his \n  \n \n32.28 Khul'  \n \nA woman may ransom herself from her husband by her \ndower or a sum more or less unless it is due to some injury \nto her. If there was an injury to her, she may reclaim what \nshe gave him and the khul' is still binding. The khul' is a \ndivorce which cannot be retracted except by a new \nmarriage contracted of her own accord \n  \nShe can do this if she is adult and sane and he is adult and sane. \nIf he is a child or mad, she cannot do that. If it is due to an injury, \nlike not paying maintenance nor making her do inappropriate \nwork and the harm is established by evidence, and the woman has \nalready obtained a khul' and then says it was only due to harm \nand presents the evidence for that, then the husband must return \nthe payment to her and the khul' is a final divorce. They cannot \nmarry again unless she has married again.  \n \n32.39 Divorce of Slaves  \n \nA woman freed from slavery who married to a slave can \nchoose between remaining married to him or separating \nfrom him. If someone buys his wife, then his marriage is \nvoid \n  \nA slave is allowed only two divorces and the ‘Idda of a \nslavegirl consists of two menstrual periods. The expiation’s \nof the slave are the same as the free man except for the \ndifferences in the hudud punishments and divorce \n  \n32.30 Kinship established by wet-nursing  \n \n32.30a This applies up to the age of two  \n \nAny milk which reaches the stomach of a nursing child in \nthe first two years, even one suck, makes marriage \nunlawful \n  \nThis is in accordance with the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"and \nyour mothers who nursed you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:23) It is applies, \neven if only on one occasion.\"  \n \nThere are certain preconditions necessary to cause the legal \nconsequences of suckling.  \n \n32.30b After the age of two  \n \nNursing after the age of two years does not cause these \nprohibitions, unless it is close to it, like a month or so, or \nsome say two months \n  \nAfter the age of two years, even if a lot of milk reaches his \nstomach, it does not create marriage barriers. This is based on the \nwords of Allah azza wa jall, \"Mothers shall suckle their children \nfor two full years,\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:233) and His words, \"his \ncarrying and weaning is 30 months.\" (Holy Qur‟an 46:15) So He \ninforms us about the minimum period of pregnancy and full period \nof nursing. A little over two years does not matter. Shaikh ibn \n'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi alaihi) says a month and Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) two months.  \n \n32.30c When the child is weaned before the age of two  \n \nIf the child is weaned before the age of two so that it eats \nfood without milk, any nursing which happens after that \ndoes not create these prohibitions \n  \nThis is according to what is in Shaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh an-Nasa'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) report that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Nursing does not \ncreate prohibitions except what splits the intestines,\" and that is \nbefore weaning. If a child eats food rather than milk, his \nintestines are opened.  \n \n32.30d Milk being poured into the mouth or nose  \n \nNursing by pouring milk into the mouth or nose creates \nthe same prohibitions \n  \nEven if it is not definite that it reached the stomach. That is what \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) reports from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays that if it reaches the stomach, it creates prohibition but \notherwise not.  \n \n32.30e Milk sisters  \n \nIf a woman nurses a boy, her daughters and her husband's \ndaughters, whether born before or after the boy, are his \nsisters. However the boy's brother may marry them.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 33: ‘Idda, Istibra' and Maintenance \n \n \n„Idda designates a woman waiting for a specific time determined \nby the Shari‟ah to see if she is pregnant. It is also a form of \nworship in itself. It is obligatory by the words of the Almighty, \n\"until the book reaches its term\" and because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said to Shaikh al-Furay'a (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \"Wait in your house until the book reaches its term.\" There \nare three types: menstrual periods, lunar months and pregnancy. \nPeriods apply to the divorced woman who menstruates, free or \nslave.  \n \n33.1 ‘Idda for divorced women  \n \n33.1a Its length  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a free woman is three periods, whether she is \nMuslim or kitabi. For a slave or partial slave, it is two \nperiods. It does not matter whether the husband is free or \na slave. A 'period' means the periods of purity between two \nmenstruation’s \n  \nThe ayat is general and this is not disputed. „Idda has to do with \nthe woman, not the husband. Divorce has to do with the men. A \nperiod is the period of purity. Imam Abu Hanifa (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says it is menstrual periods.  \n \n33.1b If the woman is not menstruating  \n \nIf the woman is not menstruating or has ceased \nmenstruation, then it is three months for a free woman, \nfree or slave \n  \nSo she cannot be pregnant. It is three months. This is agreed. It is \nthe same for the slavegirl in the famous position. This is \ncalculated by the moon. When she is divorced during the month, \nthe month in which is which is divorced is completed from the \nfourth month. The day of divorce is not counted.  \n \n33.1c A woman with constant bleeding  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a divorced woman with constant bleeding is \none year, slave or free  \n \nThat is nine months and third months.  \n \n33.1d ‘Idda for pregnant women  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a pregnant woman who is widowed or \ndivorced is when she gives birth, whether free or slave or \nkitabi \n  \nThis is in the famous position in divorce and is agreed, even if it is \na minute after the divorce or death. This applies to all by the \nwords of the Almighty, \"The term of those who are pregnant is \nwhen they lay down their burdens.\" (Holy Qur‟an 65:5) It is makes \nthe general particular in \"those of you who die and leave wives, \nthey should wait by themselves for fourth months and ten days.\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 2:234) The limitation of it is clarification. If she gives \nbirth to twins, she is not lawful until she gives birth to the second.  \n \n33.1e No ‘Idda if the marriage has not been consummated \n  \nA \ndivorced \nwoman \nwhose \nmarriage \nhas \nnot \nbeen \nconsummated has no ‘Idda  \n \n33.2 ‘Idda for widows  \n \nThe ‘Idda for a free woman who is widowed is four months \nand ten nights, whether a child or adult, consummated or \nnot, Muslim or kitabi. For a slave girl who is partially free \nit is two months and five days, except in the case of an \nolder woman whose period is delayed. Then she waits until \nthe doubt is removed. As for the one who does not \nmenstruate because of youth or old age and her marriage \nwas consummated, she cannot marry until three months \nafter the death of the husband \n  \nThis is a woman who is not pregnant, whether with false \nmenstruation or not. It is the same whatever the age of the \nhusband. Removal of doubt is by menstruation or the completion \nof nine months.  \n \n33.3 Mourning  \n \nMourning for the woman in ‘Idda because of being \nwidowed is that she not use any adornment in the form of \njewelry, kohl or other things, and she avoids all dyed \ncolors except black. She avoids all perfume. She does not \nuse henna or perfumed oil nor comb perfumed substances \ninto her hair. Mourning should be observed by the slave \nand free woman, child and adult. There is disagreement \nabout a Kitabi. A divorced woman does not have to observe \nmourning  \n \nIhdad is mourning. She avoids bracelets and similar things, and \nkohl, which would appear to be even if it was out of necessity, \nwhich it the position of Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Hakam (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). In the Mudawwana, \"She does not use kohl except for \nnecessity.\" She removes dishevelment from her self. She does not \nenter the bath-house except by necessity and does not rub her \nbody with depilatories. Black can be worn as the garment of \nsorrow. If it is an adornment among some people, she should avoid \nit. She avoids perfume and adornment because that invites \nmarriage. Henna is adornment. Mourning is observed by all ages \nbecause in Abu Dawud the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"The woman whose husband dies does not wear saffron or \nred garments, or jewelry or use henna.\" There is disagreement \nabout a Kitabi with two famous positions about whether it is \nobligatory.  \n \n33.4 The ‘Idda for a Jewish or Christian woman and umm \nWalad  \n \nA free Kitabi woman should be compelled to observe the \n‘Idda for a Muslim husband who has died or divorced her. \nThe ‘Idda of a umm Walad after the death of her master is \none menstrual period. It is the same when he frees her. If \nshe does not menstruate, it is three months  \n \nWhether it is a single or final divorce because mourning is \nprescribed to protect lineage. The man has died and has no one to \nprotect his lineage and so mourning becomes a barrier to defend \nthe dead. The Kitabi is compelled whether the marriage has been \nconsummated or not, even if she is a child or he is one.  \n \n33.5 Istibra'  \n \nIstibra' is observed in the case of a slavegirl who changes \nownership. It is one menstruation. Ownership changes by \nselling, giving away, capture, or any other way. If the \nwoman menstruates after being in the possession of the \nnew master before he has bought her, then she does not \nhave to observe an istibra' if she has not gone out. The \nistibra' for a child when she is sold is three months as it is \nfor a woman who no longer menstruates. There is no \nistibra' for a woman who has never had intercourse \n  \nIf someone buys a pregnant woman from another person or \ngains possession of her without a sale, should not go near \nher or enjoy her in any manner until she gives birth \n  \nOmitted explanation!  \n \n33.7 Lodging and maintenance of divorced wives  \n \n33.7a Right to lodging and maintenance  \n \nA divorced woman whose marriage has been consummated \nhas the right to lodging, but not maintenance unless she \nwas divorced by less than three divorces or is pregnant. If \npregnant, she has a right to maintenance whether it is one \nor three divorces \n  \nThis is distinct from khul'. Any woman whose marriage has been \nconsummated has the right to maintenance.  \n \n33.7b The position of a woman separated by a khul'  \n \nA woman with a khul' divorce has not right to maintenance \nunless she is pregnant \n  \nAny woman divorced by a final divorce is not entitled to \nmaintenance unless she is pregnant.  \n \n33.7c A woman divorced by li'an  \n \nThe woman divorce by a li'an has no maintenance, even if \nshe is pregnant \n  \nBecause the husband has denied paternity.  \n \n33.7d Widows  \n \nIn the ‘Idda period on account of being widowed, she has \nno right to maintenance but to lodging if the house \nbelonged to the decreased or he rented it \n  \nIf the marriage was consummated.  \n \n33.8 Confinement in ‘Idda  \n \nWhen she is divorced or widowed, she should not leave her \nhouse until her ‘Idda is over unless the owner of the house \nevicts her and will not accept a normal rent. Then she \nleaves and stays in the place to which she moves until the \nend of the ‘Idda \n  \nShe is not moved from her house unless it is a case of necessity. \nShe is permitted to go out to see to her needs: what this refers to \nis moving house. She must spend the night in her house. She does \nnot leave for hajj during this time.  \n \n33.9 Nursing and custody of children  \n \n33.9a Nursing the child  \n \nThe woman should nurse her child in the marriage unless \nsomeone of her status should not do so. A divorced woman \ncan nurse the child for the father and she can take a fee for \nnursing if she wishes \n  \nIf she is married or has been divorced by a revocable divorce. In \nsuch a case she receives no fee. \"A divorced woman\" refers to a \nwoman who is finally divorced or who has finished her „Idda. The \nright of nursing is a right in her favor, not one against her based \non what is reported by Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said to a woman whose \nhusband had divorced her and wanted to take her child from her, \n\"You are more entitled to the child than he is as long as you do not \nre-marry.\"  \n \n33.9b Custody  \n \nAfter a divorce, the woman has custody of a boy until he \nreaches puberty and a girl until she marries and the \nmarriage consummated \n  \nThis is the right of the mother, be she free or slave, Muslim, or \nKitabi, sensible or foolish according to Shaikh ibn 'Arafa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). This right also pertains if she is widowed. \nThe girl's maintenance is owed by the father until her marriage is \nconsummated.  \n \n33.9c Order of custody  \n \nAfter that if the mother dies or remarries, custody goes to \nthe grandmother and then the maternal aunt. If there are \nno female relatives of the mother, then it goes to one of the \nsisters and paternal uncles. If there are none, then the \nagnate relatives \n  \nCustody goes first to the mother's mother and then the father's \nmother.  \n \n33.10 Recipients of Maintenance  \n \n33.10a The wife  \n \nA man is only responsible for the maintenance of his wife, \nwhether she is rich or poor \n  \nA wealthy man is obliged to provide food, condiments, clothes and \na dwelling once he has consummated the marriage or has been \ninvited to do so while the woman is capable of intercourse. It does \nnot matter whether she is wealthy or poor, Muslim or Kitabi, free \nor slave. A divorce can be imposed on him if he is unable to \nprovide for him unless she knew of his inability in advance.  \n \n33.10b His poor parents  \n \nand his poor parents  \n \nWho are free, whether they are Muslims or unbelievers and he \nacknowledges their poverty. If he denies that they are poor, they \nmust prove but are not required to make an oath. Making them \ntake an oath would involve disrespect.  \n \n33.10c His children: sons  \n \nand to his young children who have no wealth. He is \nresponsible for sons until they reach puberty if they have \nno crippling disability \n  \nThis is free children, even if they are unbelievers. This means a \ndisability which would prevent them from earning, as when they \nare insane or blind. Then the father is required to continue to \nsupport them.  \n \n33.10d His daughters  \n \nand for girls until they marry and their marriages are \nconsummated \n  \nOr the husband, who is adult, has been invited to consummate the \nmarriage. When her husband divorces her or dies, her father is \nnot responsible for her maintenance if she is adult. If she is not \nadult, it reverts to him.  \n \n33.10e He is not responsible for other relatives  \n \nThese are the only relatives whose maintenance he is \nresponsible for \n  \nHe is not responsible for grandparents or grandchildren.  \n \n33.10f Providing the wife with servants  \n \nIf he is wealthy enough, he should provide his wife with \nservants \n  \nThis is an obligation when his wife is not someone who usually \nserves herself.  \n \n33.11 Burial  \n \n33.11a Burying slaves  \n \nHe must also maintain his slaves and shroud them if they \ndie \n  \nThe obligation is from the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) in the Sahih, \"The best sadaqa is that given by the \nwealthy. The upper hand is better than the lower hand. Begin \nwith your immediate dependents. The woman says, 'Either you \nfeed me or release me, the slave says, 'Feed me and use me,' and \nthe child says, 'Feed me until you let me go.'\"  \n \n33.11b Shrouding the wife  \n \nHere is disagreement about shrouding the wife, Shaikh ibn \nal-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is done using \nher own money, and Shaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that it comes from the husband's money. \nShaikh Sahnun (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if she is \nwealthy her money is used, and if she is poor, it is done \nfrom her husband's money \n  \nIf she is wealthy her money is used and the husband is not obliged \nto pay it because shrouding is part of maintenance which ends \nwith death. Otherwise the tie of marriage obliges that he do it \nsince he can wash her and she her private parts and they inherit \nfrom one another.  \n \n \n \nChapter 34: Sales \n \n \nThis includes hire, partnership and all sale transactions, like cash \nsales and selling a debt, sound and invalid sales, the definition of \nthe sale and transfer of goods.  \n \nThere are three essential elements of the sale:  \n \n1.  The seller and the buyer, both of whom must possess \ndiscrimination and so a sale of a child or mad person is not \nvalid, \nand \npossess \nlegal \nresponsibility, \nwhich \nis \na \nprecondition for the sale being binding. Islam is a \nprecondition for buying a Holy Qur'an or a Muslim slave.  \n \n2.  The second is the price, which must be pure, consist of \nsomething which has a use, be something which can be \nhanded over, known by both parties and something whose \nsale is not forbidden.  \n \n3.  The third element is the form of the transaction which is the \noffer and acceptance, or that which indicates acceptance like \ncustomary behavior in such matters.  \n \nThe author (rahmatullahi alaihi) begins the chapter with the \nwords of Allah azza wa jall:  \n \n34.1 Exchange of money  \n \n\"Allah has allowed trade and made usury unlawful.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 2:274)  \n \n34.1a. Legal status of usury  \n \nThe Sunnah and consensus make it unlawful. If someone states \nthat usury is lawful, there is no disagreement that he is an \nunbeliever.  \n \n34.1b. Usury in extending the terms of a debt  \n \nThe usury practiced in the Jahiliyya in debts was that \nwhen they were due, they were either paid or delayed in \nexchange for a payment of usury.  \n \nIn exchange for a delay, an increase was paid.  \n \n34.1c. Usury in exchange  \n \nBesides usury in exchange for delay, usury also consists of \nselling silver for silver, hand to hand, in unequal amounts. \nThe same applies in the case of gold for gold. Silver for \nsilver and gold for gold are not permitted except like for \nlike, hand to hand. Gold for silver is usury except hand to \nhand.  \n \nThe basis for the prohibition is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Do not sell gold for gold, except like for like.\" The \nsame applies to silver. \"Hand to hand\" means that the transaction \nis immediate.  \n \n34.2 Exchanges involving foodstuffs  \n \n34.2a. Immediacy in the exchange of stored foodstuffs  \n \nThe same applies to food grains, beans and similar foods or \ncondiments which can be stored. It is not permitted to \nexchange one category of them for the same category \nexcept hand to hand like for like. It is not permitted for \nthere to be a delay in this.  \n \nThis includes barley, millet, rice and all such grains. This would \nalso apply to such condiments as vinegar and honey. The fact that \na delay is not permissible is stressed when he says, \"hand to hand\" \nwhich means it must be immediate and direct. One considers \nlikeness in terms of legal weighing or measurement. If no criterion \nhas been transmitted from the Lawgiver about something, then \none uses whatever the customary criterion is.  \n \n34.2b. Delay not allowed in foodstuffs  \n \nIt is not permitted to exchange food for food with a delay, \nwhether in the same category or different categories, and \nwhether that can be stored or not.  \n \nThis includes fruits like pomegranates and melons because a \ndelay would entail usury.  \n \n34.2c. Exchange of perishables  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with exchanging fruits and \nvegetables which cannot stored in unequal amounts, even \nif they are of the same kind, provided it is hand to hand.  \n \nFruits which cannot be stored are like apricots and apples. \nDisparity is permitted in them, even if they are stored in rare \ncases in certain climates. This is like the case with pears, in which \nthere can be disparity in the well-known position.  \n \nIt is not permitted to have a disparity in the same category \nof dried fruits and other condiments, food and drink which \ncan be stored, except for water. There is nothing strong in \nexchanging different categories of other grains and fruit \nand foods in equal amounts from hand to hand. It is not \npermitted to have a disparity in the same category except \nin the case of fresh fruits and vegetables.  \n \nIf the items are usually storable, like walnuts and almonds, then \ndisparity is not permitted. This is a weak position in the School. \nThe well-known position is that disparity is permitted in them. \n \nDisparity is forbidden in food drink and condiments, food like \nhoney and vinegar. Disparity is permitted in water, but it is not \npermitted to sell it for food on credit according to the well-known \nposition.  \n \nThe allowance for disparity in fruit and vegetables is based on the \nsound hadith in which the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid \"When the categories are different, then sell however you \nwish.\"  \n \nHis final statement includes storable and unstorable, and this \ncontradicts what he said before about storable fruits, but we \nalready stated that the well-known position is that disparity is \nallowed in them. The difference between the permission for fresh \nfruit and vegetables and its prohibition in the case of foodstuffs is \nthat foodstuffs include that which can be stored and which is a \nmajor source of nourishment. Even if fruits and vegetables are \nstored at times, they are not a major food source.  \n \nThen he goes on to discuss those categories in which major \ndisparity is not permitted.  \n \n34.2d. Categories of foods in which there can be no \ndisparity  \n \nWheat, barley and sult-barley comprise one category in \nrespect of lawfulness and or unlawfulness. All sorts of \nraisins comprise one category. All sorts of dates comprise \none category. Beans have different categories in regard to \nsales. The position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nvaries regarding this, but his position about them being \none category for zakat purposes does not vary.  \n \nSult is huskless barley. There can be no disparity in the exchange \nof raisins or dates although they have different varieties. Shaikh \nibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that they have different \ncategories while Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) states \nthat they are the same category. For zakat purposes, the \nMudawwana states that they are a single category.  \n \n34.2e. Meat  \n \nThe meat of the quadrupeds and wild animals is \nconsidered to one category, the meat of all types of fowl is \none category, and the flesh of all water creatures is one \ncategory. Fat falls into the category of the flesh from which \nit is extracted.  \n \nQuadrupeds are: camels, cattle, sheep and goats. Wild animals \ninclude gazelles and wildebeests. The category of fowls includes \nboth wild birds and domestic ones. The flesh of an animal cannot \nbe sold for its fat except like for like, hand to hand. The same \napplies to fish oil for fish: it can only be like for like, hand to hand.  \n \n34.2f. Animal products  \n \nYogurt, cheese and butter are classified according to the \ncategory of the animals from which they are taken.  \n \nThis is one of the unclear areas of the Risala as to whether they \ncan be sold one for the other. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand his people do not permit that. Shaikh al-Jazuli (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that what is meant is that the types of milk are one \ncategory, cheese is one category and butter is one category, and \nthey are to sold like for like without disparity.  \n \n34.3 Selling goods not yet in one's possession  \n \n34.3a. Foods which cannot be sold before possession  \n \nSomeone who buys food is not permitted to sell it before he \ntakes possession of it, provided that the purchase was by \nweight, volume or number rather than unmeasured. That \nis the case for every food, condiment or drink except \nwater.  \n \nIt is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade that. This general prohibition is then restricted to the \ncategories mentioned. \"Unmeasured\" [juzaf] refers a sale without \nmeasure, weight or number. In such an (unmeasured) sale it is \npermitted to re-sell the goods before taking possession of them \naccording to the well-known position because ownership is \nachieved by the contract. Therefore if it is destroyed before he \ntakes possession of it, it is the buyer's liability. Water is excepted \nbecause it is not a food.  \n \n34.3b. Medicines and non-oil crops  \n \nMedicines and crops which are not pressed for oil are not \namong the foods which it is forbidden to sell before taking \npossession of them or which cannot be exchanged for \nunequal amounts of the same category.  \n \nLike honey which is compounded with other drugs and made into \na medicine. Crops which are not pressed normally are like onion \nseeds, chard and white radish seeds, but not seeds like sesame \nand olives which are pressed for oil. It also includes things like \nonions, garlic, coriander, cumin, fennel and pepper. It is permitted \nto sell them before receiving them and disparity in amounts is also \npermitted.  \n \n34.3c. Selling borrowed food before taking possession of it „ \n \nThere is nothing wrong with selling borrowed food before \ntaking possession of it.  \n \nIt is permitted for the one who borrows to sell it before he has full \npossession of the loan, provided it is a cash sale. That is not \npermitted in a credit sale because if the borrower were to sell it on \ncredit, that would invalid since it would be selling a debt for a \ndebt.  \n \n34.3d. Partnership, cost resale and revocation of sales are \npermitted  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with partnership in buying, in cost \nresale, or in revocation of a sale before taking possession, \nin the case of food which is measured.  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with partnership in measured food stuffs \nbefore taking possession. That is when someone has a partner in \nsome of it. There is nothing wrong in cost resale [tawliya], which \nis when he sells the commodity to someone for the same price he \npaid for it. There is nothing wrong in revocation, which is when \nthe buyer withdraws from the seller or vice versa.  \n \n34.4 Transactions which entail risk  \n \n34.4a. Contracts which entail risk are not permitted  \n \nEvery sales contract, hire or lease which contains danger \nor risk in respect of the price, the item purchased or the \nterm at which payment is due is not permitted. It is not \npermitted to sell something uncertain or to sell something \nunknown or to sell to an unknown term.  \n \n \nDanger is when it is not certain that the commodity exists, as \nwhen someone says, \"Sell me your horse in exchange for my \nprofits tomorrow.\" Risk is when one is certain something exists \nbut there are doubts about its soundness, as in selling fruits \nbefore they are ripe.  \n \nAn example of what is forbidden when there is risk in the price is \nwhen someone buys goods in exchange for his stray camel. In \nregard to the purchased item it is like when someone buys a \nrunaway slave. Risk in the term is when someone buys goods \nagainst the arrival of Zayd when he does not know when he will \nactually come.  \n \n34.5 Selling goods with hidden defects  \n \n34.5a. Deceit is not permitted  \n \nIn selling, it is not permitted to conceal faults or to \nadulterate things, nor to overrate or mislead, nor to \nconceal defects. It is not permitted to mix the bad with the \ngood, nor to conceal something about the goods which, if \nknown, would make the buyer dislike it or which would \nreduce the price if were known.  \n \nConcealment [tadlis] is to know that there is a fault in the goods, \nbut to conceal that from the buyer. Adulteration is to add \nsomething which is not part of the thing, like adding water to \nhoney. Overrating is deceit by lying about the price as when \nsomeone says, \"I bought it for twenty dinars and I will give you it \nto you for less!\" Misleading is to gull with words as when the seller \ntells him, \"Buy it from me and I will give you a reduction! “Nor is \nit permitted to mix poor wheat with good wheat.  \n \nIt is not permitted to conceal defects which would put off the \nbuyer, such as selling cloth which has been previously used as a \nshroud or by a leper. Something which would reduce the price is, \nfor instance, if a new garment is impure or has been washed.  \n \n34.5b. Defects in slaves  \n \nIf someone buys a slave and finds a defect in him, he can \nkeep him without any compensation, or return him and get \nhis money back, unless the slave has acquired a new \ncorrupting defect while in his possession. If this is the \ncase, the new owner may claim back the amount of the \noriginal defect from the price he paid, or he can return the \nslave and pay the depreciation caused by the new defect.  \n \nIf he returns a slave because of a defect and has put him to \nwork to earn revenue while he was with him, he keeps the \nrevenue.  \n \nThe same principle applies to buying slaves. The buyer has a \nchoice between keeping the slave and returning him. If he keeps \nthe slave, he receives nothing for the fault. He is allowed to return \nthe slave because there might have been concealment [tadlis] in \nthe sale. This principle applies to faults which can be concealed, \nnot a fault it is impossible to conceal since it is evident, like \nblindness, or something which is necessarily hidden, like a nut \nwhich is found to be empty when opened. In such a case, there is \nnothing the buyer can say.  \n \nIf the slave has acquired a new defect while in the possession of \nthe buyer, it must be one which would seriously decrease his \nvalue.  \n \nIf the buyer had the slave to work for him, he keeps the revenue \nfrom that work up until the time the deal is nullified, and he is not \nobliged to hand over any of that, since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Income is with responsibility.\" One of them \nsaid that the meaning of that is the as long as the goods are the \nresponsibility of the buyer, he is entitled to the revenue. When the \nsale is nullified, then the seller is entitled to the revenue.  \n \n34.6 Selling merchandise on trial, a slave with a guarantee \nor a slave girl in seclusion  \n \n34.6a. Selling on trial [khiyar]  \n \nA sale with an option to cancel is permitted when the two \nparties stipulate a short period in which the buyer can test \nthe goods or in which to seek advice. Immediate payment \nis not permitted in such a sale.  \n \nOne or both parties can make this stipulation. It is permitted \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The buyer \nand seller have the option to withdraw as long as they have not \nparted.\" Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted that in the \nMuwatta' and stated that it was permitted. They can stipulate a \nshort period which ends when the goods have been tested or until \nadvice sought has been sought. The advice can be about the \ncheapness or dearness of the price, or about undertaking the \npurchase or sale. Testing can be about ascertaining the condition \nof the goods. That varies according to different goods. The option \nin the case of a riding animal is about three days, For slaves, it is \nabout five days or a week in which to test his condition and work. \nThere is about a month for a house.  \n \n34.6c. Slave with indemnification ('uhda)  \n \nNor is immediate payment permitted in the case of a slave \nwith a three day guarantee. [Holy Qur’an 34:14]  \n \nThis is selling a slave provided that the seller has responsibility \nfor any faults that come to light in the course of three days after \nthe contract.  \n \n34.6d. A slavegirl in seclusion [muwada'a]  \n \nNor is there immediate payment in the case of a slavegirl \nplaced in seclusion to ascertain whether she is pregnant. \nThe responsibility and maintenance in that period are that \nof the seller.  \n \nPayment is also not made immediately when a slavegirl in \nseclusion is sold. It is when a valuable slavegirl or one with whom \nthe seller has had intercourse is put in the keeping of a \ntrustworthy man or woman until it is clear whether or not she is \npregnant.  \n \nPayment in these three cases is suspended when cash is \nstipulated because sometimes it will become a sale and sometimes \nit is a loan, and so it is unclear whether the payment is an \nadvance or a price.  \n \nThe seller is responsible for the goods in these cases, and for \nmaintenance of the slavegirl, as long as it is not evident that the \nbuyer is lying. In such a case, he must take an oath, even he is not \nsuspected.  \n \n34.6e. When slavegirls are secluded  \n \nA slave girl is usually only secluded to see whether she is \npregnant is when she is purchased to take to bed or when \nthe seller states that he has had intercourse with her, even \nif she is ugly. The buyer cannot absolve the seller from the \nresponsibility for the pregnancy unless it is clear and \nobvious. Absolving the seller of responsibility in things \nabout the slave about which the seller has no knowledge is \nallowed.  \n \nThis seclusion is an obligation for two types of slavegirl to \nascertain if the woman is pregnant. One is when the buyer wants \nher to sleep with, even if the seller does not admit to intercourse \nwith her since the most likely case is that intercourse might have \noccurred, and so the most likely is given the standing of the \ndefinite out of caution in sexual matters. The second case is a \nslavegirl with whom he had has intercourse in case she might be \npregnant.  \n \nIf the slavegirl is valuable and the buyer has not had intercourse \nwith her, and he says that he is not responsible for any pregnancy, \nthe sale is invalid. If she is clearly pregnant, then he may \nstipulate that he is not responsible for her pregnancy. He limits it \nto \"valuable\" rather than ugly. It is absolutely permitted to \nstipulate that he is not responsible for the pregnancy of an ugly \nslavegirl, whether that is clear or not.  \n \nOne may absolve himself in the case of slaves, but not other \nthings. That is the well-known position. The permissibility of that \nis limited to two things. One is that the seller does not know about \nit. If he knows that there is a fault and disclaims responsibility for \nit, that does not help him. The second is that he has remained a \nlong time with it. If, for instance, he buys a slave and then sells \nhim soon afterwards, stipulating his lack of liability, that is of no \nuse.  \n \n34.6f. A mother may not be separated from her child  \n \nA mother and her child are not separated in a sale until the \nchild has grown his second set of teeth.  \n \nIt is not permitted to separate them. This applies to children by \nlineage and applies whether they, the mother and child, are \nMuslims or unbelievers, or one is Muslim and the other an \nunbeliever since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) made a \ngeneral statement about that: \"If someone separates a mother \nfrom her child, Allah azza wa jall will separate him from those he \nloves on the Day of Rising.\" [Shaikh at-Tirmidhi, hasan]. It is \nlimited to the mother by lineage, not the mother by suckling. It is \npermitted to separate them if the relationship is only one of \nsuckling. It does not include other relatives besides the mother, \nlike the father. It is permitted to sell them separately.  \n \nThe prohibition against separation has a point at which it ends. \nThe second teeth refers to when the milk teeth fall out. Then it is \npermitted to sell them separately because the child is independent \nfrom his mother in eating, drinking, and sleeping.  \n \n34.7 Responsibility in an invalid sale  \n \n34.7a. Basic rule of responsibility for the goods  \n \nIn an invalid sale, the seller remains responsible for the \ngoods. But if the buyer has taken possession of them, he is \nresponsible for them from the time he has them in his \npossession.  \n \nAn invalid sale would be like one conducted during the adhan for \nJumu'a. The seller remains responsible because it is still his \nproperty and ownership has not been transferred to the buyer. If \nthe buyer has taken possession of them, he is responsible because \nhe has not taken them as a trust, but as a sort of quasi-ownership. \nThat is the reason given by Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) stated there is \nsome confusion in his reasoning, since it is obvious, as stated \nbefore, that there is no transfer in an invalid sale while there \nmust be a transfer according to his argument. It is possible that \nhe means that his taking possession is quasi-ownership is based \non his claim. When he takes possession, thinking that he is taking \nownership and then causes damage, he is responsible, even if \nownership has not been transferred to him in reality. That is why \nhe is liable. That applies from the moment he takes possession of \nthe goods, not from the moment he makes the contract. If the \ncontract had been sound, he would have been responsible from the \nmoment the contract was concluded.  \n \n34.7b. Consequences of buyer responsibility  \n \nSo if the market price changes or the commodity is altered, \nthen the buyer must pay its price on the day he bought it \nand does not return it. If, however, it is something sold by \nmeasure or weight, he must return its equivalent. Real \nestate is unaffected by market changes.  \n \nThe market price can rise or fall. If the commodity is altered and \nit is possible to assess its value, the buyer must pay that amount, \nwhatever it is, even it is more than the original price, not the price \non day of the judgment, and then he does not have to return the \ngoods if they still exist. If it is something replaceable, which can \nbe weighed, measured or counted, then he returns the equivalent. \nIf it is impossible to return the like, then he must pay the price. \nAn example of this is fresh dates when their time has passed. \nThen the price is assessed on the day he is unable to pay.  \n \nReal estate is not affected because usually land is bought for \nprivate use, and so a change in the price is not investigated, which \nis not the case with other things.  \n \n34.8 Free loans [salaf] \n \ni.e. not a loan meant as an investment  \n \n34.8a Illegal transactions in loans  \n \nIt is not permitted to make a loan in exchange for some \nbenefit [for the lender]. It is not permitted to combine a \nsale and a loan in a single transaction. The same applies if \nthe loan is combined with hire or rental.  \n \nThat is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nthat. That is like when someone has some poor quality wheat and \nlends it to someone who takes it from him in exchange for \nrepaying it with good wheat.  \n \nAn example of the form of combining a sale and a loan is when two \ngoods are sold for two dinars with a month's credit and then one of \nthem is bought for a dinar in cash. So it is as if the seller has \ntaken one item and a dinar in cash and at the end of the term, he \ntakes two dinars: one in exchange for the goods, which is a sale, \nand the second in exchange for the dinar in cash, which is a loan.  \n \nNor is permitted to couple a loan with hire or rent as a \nprecondition for making the loan, because hire or rent are a form \nof sale and not a special quality in themselves. It is not permitted \nto make a loan a precondition of marriage, partnership, the qirad \nloan, musaqa or money changing.  \n \nTo sum up, no contract entailing compensation can be combined \nwith a loan.  \n \n34.8b. What can be lent  \n \nA loan is permitted in everything except slave girls or \nsilver ore.  \n \nA loan [salaf] means giving something with the intention of \npleasing Allah azza wa jall so that the borrower can use it and \nthen return its equivalent. It is permitted, i.e. recommended, in \nitems which will be useful for the borrower and relieve his \ndifficulties. It can also become obligatory or forbidden in certain \ncases. It is allowed in everything which it is lawful to own, even if \nit is not valid to sell it, and thus includes the tanned skin of \ncarrion and the meat of sacrifices.  \n \nSlavegirls are an exception to this because that would lead to \nlending sexual favors, although a loan of a slavegirl can be made \nto a woman or to a child who is of an age where he cannot have \nintercourse. That is permitted as stated by Shaikh al-Lakhmi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and others.  \n \n34.9 Surrendering borrowed or sold property  \n \n34.9a. No reductions or increases allowed for a change in \nthe collection date  \n \nA reduction in the debt is not permitted in order to hasten \nits collection nor can it be delayed in exchange for an \nincrease in the amount due.  \n \nThis is according to the well-known position. The fuqaha' call this \ncase \"putting down and expediting\". Its form is that one man owes \na debt to another which is due at a certain time, like a hundred \ndirhams with a month's credit. The one owed the debt tells him, \n\"Give me the fifty now and I will reduce it by fifty for you.\" This is \nforbidden because whoever moves up a thing before it is obliged \nbecomes a borrower. So it is as if the payer is lending the one owed \nthe money fifty dirhams in exchange for his responsibility when \nthe 100 are due. So it is a loan in exchange for an increase. If that \noccurs, what he took from him is returned to him. When the term \ncomes, the lender takes all that he was first due, which is 100.  \n \nThe same applies to delaying the debt in exchange for an increase, \nas happened in the Jahiliyya because that is borrowing for an \nincrease. When the time for repayment comes, the person who \nowes the debt says, \"Give me a delay and I will give you more than \nyou are owed.\"  \n \n34.9b. Not granting an increase in return for earlier \npossession  \n \nGoods are not collected sooner in exchange for increase in \nthem when there is a sale involved.  \n \nThat is part of getting rid of responsibility for the goods. An \nexample of a case in which you are given an increase is when you \nbuying a hundred garments of known description from a man and \nhe tells you, \"Take your garments,\" and you reply, \"I will leave \nthem with you. I have no need of them now.\" He says, \"Take them \naway and I will give you five more.\" That five is in return for \ncanceling his responsibility for them.  \n \n34.9c. Returning borrowed goods before they are due  \n \nThere is no harm in returning a loan early with an \nincrease which is only in the quality.  \n \nThere are two preconditions here. One is that the goods are part of \na loan and the second is that the increase is only in the quality. \nFor instance, if the borrowed garment is one of poor quality, he \nsays, \"I will give you better than it if I return it early.  \n \n34.9d. Returning a loan with an increase  \n \nThere is disagreement about when someone repays a trade \nloan [qard] with an additional amount at the time of \nrepayment when there was no stipulation, promise or \ncustom to do so. Ashhab allowed that, but Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) disliked it and did not allow it.  \n \n\"At the time of repayment due (lit. meeting of settlement)\" is the \nmoment in which it is paid, whether that is before or after the \nagreed term. A stipulation about this would be, for example, when \nthe lender says, \"I will not lend to you unless you give me more \nthan I lent you.\" A custom refers to the borrower who normally \ngives more when he repays. The reason for allowing it is that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The best of people is \nthe one who is the best in payment, and the best of you is the one \nwho is the best repayment,\" as Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) said. The literal words of the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwould mean that Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) allowed it \nabsolutely, whether a little or a lot of increase. What Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) actually allowed is a small increase \nlike a dinar in a hundred and one ardib in a hundred. It is possible \nthat Shaikh Ashhab's (rahmatullahi alaihi) position applies both \nto a little and a lot. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ndisliked doing that with a prohibitive dislike in the well-known \nposition.  \n \n34.9e. Payment before the loan is due  \n \nIf someone owes dinars or dirhams as the result of a sale or \na loan which has a set term, he can pay them before they \nare due. He can also hand over goods or food from a loan \nearly, but not when it is because of a sale.  \n \nThat is because the term is his right. If he forgoes his right, then \nthe lender must accept it and is compelled to do so. This is the \nsame for a loan or a debt. He cannot be compelled to accept it in \nthe case of in a sale or an advance because they both have a right \nin that case. A seller is not compelled to accept early payment, \neven if it is only a day or two.  \n \n34.10. Risky things which may not be sold  \n \n34.10a. Not selling fruits or grain before they are ripe  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell fruits or grain whose ripeness \nhas not appeared, but it is permitted to sell them when the \nripeness of some of them has appeared, even if that is on \none palm tree among many.  \n \nThis refers to fruit on trees, like dates and grapes while they are \nstill green, or grain which has not developed, like wheat and broad \nbeans. It is not permitted because there is no legal use in the sale \nbefore ripeness appears. The appearance of the ripeness of dates is \nwhen they turn red or yellow. Its appearance in crops like grapes \nis when sweetness appears. The appearance in grain is that it is \ndry. Any contract formed before that is void.  \n \nIt is permitted to sell fruits when some of them are ripe, even one \npalm tree as long it is not a bakura, which is a tree which ripens \nwell before the others so that the goodness of the others does not \nimmediately follow it. It is not permitted to sell a garden on the \nbasis of the soundness of the fruit of such a tree, but the fruits of \nthat tree on its own can be sold.  \n \n34.10b. Not selling things which one does not have  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell fish which are still in rivers or \npools, nor can one sell a fetus still in its mother's womb, \nnor the fetus of what is in the wombs of other animals. It is \nnot permitted to sell the offspring of unborn camels nor to \nsell the sperm of male camels nor to sell a runaway slave or \nstray camel.  \n \nThe prohibition about fish is based on what Imam Ahmad \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted about the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) forbidding buying fish still in water, i.e. due to \nuncertainty, and the uncertainty in it has two aspects. One is the \nlack of the ability to hand the fish over, and the fish might be little \nor large.  \n \nIt is also not permitted to sell a fetus, human or animal, because \nof the uncertainty since one does not know whether it will be born \nalive or dead, fully formed or not fully formed, male or female.  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell the offspring of unborn camels, and that \nis because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade such a \nsale, which is called habal al-habala. Ibn Wahb explained it as the \noffspring of a camel's offspring. It cannot be concealed that this \nentails great uncertainty. If it is forbidden to sell what is in the \nwomb, how can one sell the future offspring of what is in the \nwomb!  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell the sperm of camels since it is confirmed \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade selling the \nstud uses of a camel. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \n\"If that is limited to a number of times or a period of time, then it \nis permitted. Shaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) related that \nit is disliked because of its prohibition.  \n \nA runaway slave is not to be sold while he is on the run because of \nthe forbidden uncertainty. If he is resident or it is clear that he is \nno longer on the run, then it is permitted, i.e. when a time is \nstipulated as, for example, when he says, \"The end of his being on \nthe run is four days.\" Or it can be limited by place, as he says, \n\"His being on the run will end at Alexandria.\" The same ruling \napplies to stray camels because of the uncertainly about the \nability to get hold of them.  \n \n34.11 Dogs  \n \n34.11a It is not permitted to sell dogs  \n \nSelling dogs is forbidden. There is disagreement about \nwhether one can sell those dogs which are permitted to be \nkept.  \n \nThe prohibition derives from what is reported in Muslim where \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade the proceeds \nfrom the sale of dogs, money earned through prostitution and the \nearnings of a soothsayer. The disagreement is about dogs which \nare used as guard dogs and for hunting. There are two well-\npositions about whether that is permitted or prohibited.  \n \n34.11b. Liability for killing dogs  \n \nIf someone kills such a dog, he is liable for its price.  \n \nIf someone kills a dog it is permitted to keep, he must pay the \nprice according to the position that it is permitted to sell it. As for \ndogs not permitted to be kept, there is no price for such a dog.  \n \n34.12 Muzabana exchange  \n \nA sale of something which entails dealing with something whose \nweight, measure or number is unknown.  \n \n34.12a. It is not permitted to sell meat for a live animal  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell meat for a live animal of the same \nspecies.  \n \nThat is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nthat and because it is selling something known for something \nunknown, which is one meaning of muzabana. Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) considers the prohibition to be specific to \nmeat in exchange for a live animal of the same type, as the Shaikh \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) indicates here. The species in this case \nmeans the linguistic category for the type and the class, like \nselling beef, for instance, for sheep. In the Mukhtasar, the \nprohibition is limited to meat which has not been cooked. \nOtherwise it is permitted, as it is permitted to sell it for other \nthan its species, like selling mutton for birds.  \n \n34.12b. Combining  two sales in the same contract not \npermitted  \n \nIt is not permitted to have two sales in the same contract. \nThat is when someone can buys goods for either five in \ncash or ten on credit, and the sale becomes binding after \none of the two prices is paid.  \n \nIt is confirmed the that Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade that. There are two forms of that. One is when someone \nbuys the same goods for two prices. The Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) indicated that here, which is either paying five in cash or \nten on credit and the sale becomes binding once one price is paid. \nHe used the price to designate the sale as the price is one of the \nessential elements of the sale. The second form is to sell two \ndifferent commodities for one price, like a garment and a sheep, as \na requirement of the sale. The precondition for its being forbidden \nis because that becomes binding for one or both parties and \nbecause of the uncertainty entailed since the seller does not know \nthe price he was paid nor the seller what he paid. If it is not \nbinding, then it is permitted.  \n \n34.12c. Not selling dried fruits for fresh ones  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell dried dates for fresh ones, nor \nraisins for grapes, whether for disparate amounts or equal \namounts, nor any type of fresh fruit for the dried fruit of \nthe same type. This is muzabana which is forbidden.  \n \nThis cannot be done, either in similar or disparate amounts, since \nit is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was \nasked about selling dried dates for fresh ones and he asked, \"Do \ndried dates reduce in size when they are dried?\" \"Yes,\" they \nreplied. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Then no.\" Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"They are not sold.\" Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that there is no harm in that.  \n \nIt is also not permitted to sell raisins for grapes in disparate or \nequal amounts because there can be no equivalence in them, \nbecause when dried, the fresh may be more than the dried, or less \nor the same. This is uncertainty and lack of knowledge of actual \nequivalence, and is tantamount to actual disparity. Disparity is \nnot permitted because they are the same category. This applies to \nany sort of fresh fruit in exchange for dried. This would include \ngrains and any fruits which differ when they fresh from how they \nare when dried. He excludes different types because disparity is \npermitted when the two are different types.  \n \nMuzabana is forbidden, which here is selling something known for \nsomething unknown of the same type. We consider muzabana to \nbe confined to things susceptible to usury, even if the hadith \nwhich explains it uses something which is susceptible to usury.  \n \n34.12d. Not selling undetermined quantity for a determined \nquantity  \n \nOne does not sell an undetermined amount for a measured \namount of the same commodity, nor an undetermined \namount for an undetermined amount of the same category \nunless the difference between the two is clear and it is \nsomething in which disparity in the same category is \npermitted.  \n \nThis is like selling a heap of wheat whose measure is unknown for \na heap of wheat whose measure is unknown since it is muzabana \nwhen it is the same category. When the two categories are \ndifferent, that is permitted provided it is obvious, i.e. the two \ncategories are clearly different, be it selling an unknown for a \nknown or vice versa, whether or not the difference is evident. \nWhen it is clear that there is difference between the measured \nquantity and the unmeasured, or the unmeasured and the \nunmeasured, it is permitted to sell them if they are a category in \nwhich disparity is permitted. This cannot be done with something \nwhich is storable and a stable food, nor with gold or silver.  \n \n34.13 Selling Absent Goods  \n \n34.13a. Absent goods can be sold based on their description  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with selling an absent article \nbased on its description. Pre-payment is not to be \nstipulated unless its location is close or it is something safe \nfrom change, like a house, land or a tree. Pre-payment can \nbe made for these.  \n \nThis is according to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and his \npeople, with certain preconditions. One is that the item is \ndescribed. Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \napparent meaning of his words is that if it is sold without a \ndescription and it not been seen, then it is not allowed. If it is, he \nhas an option to cancel when he sees it. That is what is stated in \nthe chapter on uncertainty in the Mudawwana.  \n \nThe second precondition is that someone other than the seller \ndescribes it because the seller is not reliable in his description \nsince he intends to augment its description so that the goods will \nsell. The precondition for its being described by other than the \nseller is when there is prepayment, even voluntarily. Otherwise, \nthe description of the seller is accepted as probable.  \n \nThe third precondition is that the goods are not very far away. \nThis is a precondition if the sale is definite. If there is an option to \ncancel, it is permitted because there is no harm to the buyer.  \n \nThe fourth is that pre-payment is not stipulated. It is forbidden \nbecause it is not possible to hand over the goods so that he pays \nthe price but does not receive the goods and thus it becomes a \nloan.  \n \n34.13b. Exceptions to forbidding prepayment  \n \nHe makes two exceptions to forbidding obliging pre-payment. One \nis when the absent goods are near to the place, whether it is \nanimals, commodities or immovable property, like a day or two. \nThe second exception is when the sale concerns one of the \ncategories mentioned. It is something which is safe from sudden \nchange, unlike the situation with animals. It is not permitted to \nmake a precondition for prepayment of categories subject to \nchange when they are located far away.  \n \n34.14 Slaves sold with an indemnification  \n \n34.14a. Indemnification ['uhda] is permitted in slaves  \n \nA guarantee is permitted in selling a slave when that is \nstipulated or it is the local custom. In the three day \nguarantee the seller is completely responsible for defects \nin that slave, and in a year's guarantee, he is only \nresponsible for insanity or either type of leprosy.  \n \nAn 'uhda is a contract in which responsibility for the goods \nremains that of the seller after the contract for a certain period. It \nis permitted in the case of slaves but not animals because a slave \nhas the ability to conceal his defects, which is not the case with \nother commodities, and he may be concealing a defect which the \nbuyer will dislike, and its concealment may be due to harm or \ndislike in the seller. The period of indemnification is set when it is \nstipulated in the contract or when the ruler obliges people to do \nthat. If none of this exists, then it is not set.  \n \nFor three days the seller is responsible for everything, even death, \ndrowning, burning or suicide. If the buyer finds an illness within \nthe three days, he can return the slave without evidence. If that \noccurs after three days, he must produce evidence that the slave \nhad that illness when he purchased him. The buyer is responsible \nfor the feeding and clothing of the slave in this period and any \nrevenue he earns in that period belongs to the buyer.  \n \nIn the year's guarantee, the seller is only liable for three things. \nOne is insanity, which is by jinn possession or nature, not due to a \nblow or rapture. He is not returned since it is possible to cure that \nby treatment which differs from the first two cases. The other two \nthings are the two forms of leprosy [whitening and that which \ninvolves mutilation]. The contract is specific to these diseases. \nThat is because their causes can exist while they only manifest \nthemselves at certain times of the year, as is the custom of Allah \nazza wa jall in the effect of that cause in that season. So the four \nseasons must be passed through, which is a full year, to show that \nhe is clear of these defects.  \n \n34.15 Sale with advance payment [salam]  \n \n34.15a Advance payment is permitted  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in advance payment [salam] for \ngoods, slaves, animals, food and condiments, provided the \ngoods have a known description and there is a set term of \ndelivery. The price is to be paid immediately, or with a \nshort delay of something like two or three days, if that is \nstipulated in the contract.  \n \nThis is also called salaf, and it is a term used to designate a type \nof sale in which what is purchased is not collected immediately. \nIts reality is that the price is advanced and delivery of the goods \npurchased delayed. The Book, Sunnah and consensus indicate \nthat it is allowed. The evidence in the Book is the words of Allah \nazza wa jall, \"Allah has permitted trade.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:274) As \nfor the Sunnah, it is reported in the two Sahih Collections that \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, 'When anyone pays in \nadvance for something, it must be for a specified measure and \nspecified weight for a specified term.\" The Community agree that \nit is permitted.  \n \nIt is allowed in the commodities he mentioned provided the goods \nfor which the advance is paid have a known category, amount and \nquality as he indicated. If the purchase is food, then its type must \nbe specified, either wheat, barley, or millet, or if it is fruit, it is \nspecified, whether raisins or dates. The amount is specified by \nwhatever is the custom in measure, weight, number or length or \nwhatever. The description must be specific. If it is food, he \nmentions what describes it. If is an animal, then the species is \nmentioned, its color, and whether it is male or female.  \n \nTwo things are considered about the term. It is must be known \nand it is a length of time in which market prices can change. Its \nminimum is half a month. It is not valid to give an advance for \nimmediately delivery according to what is common in the school.  \n \n34.15b. Preconditions of the payment  \n \nHe indicates preconditions of the payment, and that he must pay \nthe entire price because when he pays some and delays some, it is \ninvalid because it is a debt for a debt. There can be a short delay \nof a day or two if it is not stipulated that he pay cash when the \ncontract is made. It is permitted for the advance to be paid after \ntwo or three days. That is still considered immediate payment, \nand he mentions this specifically. His words would mean that if it \nis longer than that, such a precondition is not allowed.  \n \n34.15c. Delivery of the goods paid for in advance  \n \nWe prefer for the delivery of the goods paid for by advance \nto be fifteen days, or for it to be collected from another \ntown, even if that is two or three days distant. According to \nmore than one scholar, it is permitted to pay three days in \nadvance and collect it in the same town in which the \nadvance was paid. Others dislike that.  \n \nThat is because the market generally changes in such a period. It \nis clear that it is about that. That is like when he says, \"We prefer \nfor the length of the advance to be up to fifteen days.\" The school \nof Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is the term of the advance is \nthat in which something like it will change its price in markets \nwithout that being specifically defined. The subject of the \ndisagreement is when the price of the advance is paid when the \ngoods for which the advance is paid are in the same town. If each \nof them are in different towns, the term mentioned is not a \nprecondition, as he indicated.  \n \nIf the goods are in another town other than where the advance is \npaid, the distance between the two is the term for the advance, \nbecause usually there is a difference of prices in different places. It \ndoes not matter if it is only half a day.  \n \nSome scholars, including Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), allow \nthe advance in the same town, while others, like Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi), dislike it.  \n \n34.15d. An advance cannot be with the same type of goods  \n \nIt is not permitted for the payment to consist of the same \ntype of goods as that for which the advance payment is \nmade. No advance is made of the same type or similar type \nof goods unless he lends him something to be repaid with \nsomething of the same quality and quantity, and the \nborrower enjoys the benefit.  \n \nThis is when the goods for which the advance is made are more \nthan the payment, like one qintar of iron for two qintars because \nthe object of an advance is to bring about a benefit. The same \nholds when it is less, like two garments for one garment of the \nsame type because it is a liability in exchange for a wage. When \nthe payment for the advance is similar to the goods in description \nand amount, it is permitted, as he states here, like donkeys for \nasses, or linen slaves for cotton slave because their uses are close.  \n \nAn exception to the prohibition against advancing a thing of the \nsame type is a loan which is repaid with its like. The borrower \nenjoys the use, but it is not permitted for the lender to be the one \nwho benefits.  \n \n34.16. Exchange of debts  \n \n34.16a. It is not permitted to sell a debt for a debt.  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell a debt for a debt.  \n \nIt is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nselling an outstanding debt for an outstanding debt. The people of \nlanguage say that that means a delayed payment for a delayed \npayment, meaning a debt in exchange for a debt. According to the \nfuqaha', it denotes three things: selling a debt for a debt, \ncontracting a debt in exchange for a debt, and abrogating one debt \nby another debt. So the expression, \"selling a debt for a debt\" has \ntwo applications which includes three forms.  \n \n34.16b. A forbidden aspect  \n \nOne form of that is to stipulate delay of payment for the \nsalam sale until the goods are delivered, or to delay \npayment more than three days after the contract.  \n \nPayment of the salam cannot be set for more than three days after \nthe contract. It is part of \"a debt for a debt\" because it prolongs the \nresponsibilities of both.  \n \n34.16c. Not canceling one debt by another debt  \n \nNor is it permitted to cancel one debt by another debt. \nThat is when someone owes you something and you cancel \nit by allowing him to pay you something else at a latter \ndate.  \n \nAn example of this is that he owes you ten dinars on a year's \ncredit. Then cancel it for ten garments, for instance. If the \ncancellation is at the term or shorter than it, there are two \npositions. One is that is permitted, which appears to be most \nlogical. It is also said that it is forbidden, and that is the better \nknown position.  \n \n34.17 Sale of goods one does not have  \n \nIt is not permitted to sell something which you do not have \nif it is stipulated that you must deliver it immediately.  \n \nIf it is clear that if he wants immediate delivery. This is when he \nsells something for which he is responsible and does not have and \nso he must go to the market and buy it and then hand it over to \nthe buyer. This entails risk and uncertainty, because he may or \nmay not find it, and if he does find it, he will buy it for more than \nthe price for which he sold and must make up the price himself, \nand is forbidden foolishness, or he buys it for less and consumes \nthe rest falsely, which is not permitted.  \n \n34.18 Reversal of sale on time  \n \nWhen you sell some goods to be paid for later, you may not \nbuy them back by paying in cash less than you sold it for or \nby taking a shorter term to pay for it than the term given \nto the original buyer, nor can you pay more for it or take a \nlonger term to pay for it than the original term. It is \npermitted to buy it at the original date, and that is fair \nexchange [muqassa].  \n \nThe sale in the first example is when he sells a garment for ten \ndirhams for a month and then buys it for five in cash. The \nexample of the second is that he sells it to him for one hundred for \na month and then buys it for fifty for fifteen days. Both cases are \nforbidden because they entail a loan in exchange for an increase \nbecause he pays a little in order to take more than it.  \n \nAnother case is when you sell goods for a price on credit. You \ncannot then buy them back for more than the price, as when a \nman sells goods for one hundred for a month and then buys them \nfor one hundred fifty for two months because that entails a debt \nfor a debt. If you sell goods for a price on credit and then buy them \nfor a price on credit for the same term, that is permitted whether \nthe price is more or less or the same, because there is no reason to \nbe on guard. Fair exchange is when you see goods for one hundred \nfor a month and then buy it for one hundred on credit. This is \nresponsibility for one hundred. So at the end there is one hundred \nfor one hundred.  \n \n34.19 Buying in undetermined amounts [juzaf]  \n \n34.19a It is permitted to buy in unmeasured amounts  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in buying undetermined amounts \nof things which can be measured or weighed, except for \ndinars and dirhams which are minted. It is, however, \npermitted in the case of pieces of gold and silver.  \n \n\"Undetermined\" means not weighed, measured or counted. \n\"Nothing wrong\" means it is permitted. In the Sahih we read that \nthe Companions, may Allah azza wa jall be pleased with all them, \nsold fruits in undetermined amounts. It is, however, forbidden to \nsell minted dinars and dirhams in undetermined amounts because \nthat is part of what contains risk and gambling. It is permitted \nwith pieces of gold and silver unless they are used for currency. \nWhen they are used as currency, then it is not permitted to do \nthat.  \n \n34.19b. Things which can be easily counted are not sold \nuncounted  \n \nIt is not permitted to buy slaves and garments in \nundetermined amounts, nor other things which can be \ncounted without difficulty.  \n \nThis would also be like two gardens. It is easy to count small \nnumbers.  \n \n34.20. Right to the accessories of items sold  \n \n34.20a. Pollinated palms and crops  \n \nIf someone sells date palms after they have been \npollinated, the fruit belongs to the seller unless the buyer \nstipulates that is part of the sale. It is the same with other \ntypes of fruit. Pollinating [ibar] is using the male blossoms \nto pollinate the female, but in respect of crops, it means \nwhen they spout from the soil.  \n \nThis is when all or most trees have been pollinated. The fruit still \nbelongs to the seller unless it is part of the contract. This is a \ngeneral principle which applies to all sorts of fruit, like grapes and \nolives. Pollination of palms means to put pollen on the fruit from \nthe male palm tree. In other than palms, like peaches and figs, it \nis when the fruits begin to grow so that they can be seen. The \nwell-known position about crops is that it is when they start to \nemerge. So if someone buys sowed land in which has not yet \nappeared, he obtains the seeds in it.  \n \n34.20b. A slave's possessions  \n \nIf someone sells a slave who owns some property, that \nproperty belongs to the seller, unless the buyer stipulates \notherwise.  \n \nHe stipulates it for the slave, not for himself. If he stipulates it for \nhimself, that it is forbidden if the price was gold or silver, and the \nproperty is gold or silver.  \n \n34.21 Examining items  \n \n34.21a Buying items unseen but described  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in buying what is bags with a \nknown description on rosters.  \n \nThis is permitted. Even though the basis is forbidden, it is \npermitted because of the difficulty and hardship entailed for the \nseller in untying the bags which may sully what is in itself and be \na great burden if the buyer is not satisfied. So the description \ntakes the place of actual seeing. What is meant by rosters is a \nwritten description. If he finds the contents to be what is on the \nroster, then the sale is binding and the buyer has no option to \ncancel. If he finds that the contents are different, he has an option \nto make the sale binding or cancel it.  \n \n34.21b. What one cannot buy without seeing it  \n \nIt is not permitted, however, to buy cloth which is not \nunfolded nor described nor to buy if it is a dark night \nwhen the buyer and seller cannot see it or know what is in \nit. The same holds for buying an animal on a dark night.  \n \nLiterally it would mean that if it is described, it is permitted. The \nwell-known position is that it is not permitted because there is no \nhardship involved in bringing it out and unfolding it. His words \nmight also give rise to the impression that if it is a moonlit night, \nit permitted. According to the Mudawwana it is absolutely not \npermitted, whether it is a dark or moonlit night.  \n \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) also says that about \nselling flock animals. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) makes \na distinction about that whose meat is eaten, which can be sold \nsince it possible to test it at night by touching it with the hand to \nclarify the aim of it being fat or lean.  \n \n34.22 Bidding  \n \n34.22a. No bidding when a sale is about to be concluded  \n \nNo one should bid against his brother's bid when the two \nparties are satisfied and near to closing a deal, but he can \ndo so at the beginning of the bidding.  \n \nA sale is finalized verbally, even if the two parties have not \nphysically separated.  \n \nIt is forbidden when the buyer and seller are close to agreement \nand only the finalization remains. Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that bidding in sales to seeking to increase the price.  \n \nWe believe that sales are concluded by a verbal agreement, or \nwhat indicates it, like a gesture or handing over, even if they have \nnot separated. The hadith says that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"The buyer and seller have the option as long as \nthey have not separated.\" Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes \nthe separation to be by words. \n  \nThen he begins to discuss transactions which resemble sales.  \n \n34.23. Hiring services by time, piece-work and renting  \n \n34.23a. Hiring services is permitted  \n \nHiring services [ijara] is permitted when the two parties \nset the length of time and the payment.  \n \nIn a hadith, we read that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"I will be the antagonist of three people on the Day of Rising: \na man who makes a covenant in My name and then betrays it, a \nman who sells a free man and then consumes the money he gets \nfor him, and a man who hires an employee and gets full work from \nhim and then does not pay him his wages.\" This hadith is in the \ntwo Sahih Collections. The apparent meaning of the words is that \nthere must be a term set for every employment, but that is not the \ncase when the types of employment do not need a term. It is work \nwhose end is when it is finished, like sewing and weaving. Naming \nthe payment is necessary, as Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said. When it is not named, that is not allowed unless it is \nsomething common which does not vary, and then it is permitted.  \n \n34.23b. Piece-work jobs  \n \nNo term is fixed in a contract to recover a runaway slave \nor a lost camel, or to dig a well, to sell a garment or similar \nthings. He receives nothing until the work is complete.  \n \nIt is not set because that would increase the uncertainty about \nwage since the term pay pass before the work is complete and so \nhis work will be for nothing, or he make take what he is not \nentitled to if the work is complete before the end of the term. A \npiece-work job can consist of many things, like the cases \nmentioned here.  \n \nSomething similar is stated in the Mukhtasar. Shaikh Bahram \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It may be something in which the \ncontractor only obtains a useful benefit when the work is \ncomplete. How will he obtain that benefit if the work is not \ncomplete? He must receive an amount which he benefits by. An \nexample of that if when he looks for a runaway slave in one area \nand does not find him there, there is some benefit for the \ncontractor because he knows that he is not that area.\" It is \nunderstood from the words of the Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand the Mukhtasar that when the work is not complete, he gets \nnothing, and that is the case. That is the case since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is a camel load for the \none who brings it.\"  \n \n34.23c Someone hired to sell something by the end of a \nterm  \n \nIf someone is hired to sell something by the end of a term \nand he still has not sold it at the end of the time, he is \nentitled to his full wage. If he sells it after half the term, he \nonly receives half the wage.  \n \nThis is when he is hired to sell a specific item. The reason for this \nis that when the hire is connected to uses, each of part of it is in \nreturn for a part of the uses. If it is said that it was already stated \nthat no term can be put on a job whereas here he mentions the \nend of the term and so this is a contradiction, the answer is that it \nis not a contradiction because before he was speaking about piece-\nwork and here it is hire, which is not allowed without a term as \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated. \n \n34.23d Renting [kira']  \n \nRenting is like selling as far what is lawful or unlawful is \nconcerned. If someone rents a particular riding animal to \ngo to a certain place and the animal dies, the rest of the \nhire is canceled. It is the same when an employee dies, or \nwhen a house is rented but collapses before the end of the \nterm.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that renting [kira'] \nis used for that which is without intelligence and hiring (ijara) is \nfor that with intelligence. It resembles sales in respect of having a \nknown term and known rent, and in being forbidden without a \nknown term and the like. The difference between hire and rent \nbegins with his description of renting a riding animal. It indicates \nthat renting is used for selling the use of an animal which has no \nunderstanding. He calls an employee ajir, because he has \nintelligence.  \n \nRenting the use of an animal is like when he says, \"Rent me this \nanimal,\" which he points at it, \"so that I can use it for travel to a \ncertain place.\" If the animal then dies, or is confiscated or claimed, \nthe rent is canceled and he pays for the distance he has traveled, \nwithout consideration for the first rent because it might be cheap \nor expensive.  \n \nIf an employee is hired for a particular job for a known period to \nwork in a house or tend sheep, the same ruling as that of the \nanimal applies. The rest of the hire is canceled. The same applies \nwhen all or part of a house collapses or there is great harm in it or \nits burns or is claimed before the end of the rent, whether the rent \nis monthly or yearly. It is canceled and he pays for the time he \nlived there.  \n \n34.23e Teachers and doctors  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in a teacher teaching the Holy \nQur'an being paid when the student has mastered it and \nfor a doctor to be to be employed provides he cures the \npatient.  \n \n It is permitted to employ someone to teach the Holy Qur'an to \nchildren until they master it, i.e. memorize it, all or part. There is \nalso no harm in hiring a doctor who is paid when he cures the \npatient.  \n \n34.23f The death of a renter does not end the rental  \n \nThe rental of an animal or house does not end with the \ndeath of the renter nor does not the hire of a shepherd end \nby the death of the sheep. The sheep should be replaced \nwith a similar flock.  \n \nThat is because the item rented remains and the heirs can rent it \nfor its like or less. In the case a shepherd, if he is not given a new \nflock, he is paid the full wage.  \n \n34.23g. When a rented animal dies  \n \nIf someone rents out an animal with a guarantee and then \nthe animal dies, he should provide another. If the rider \ndies, the rental is not canceled and his heirs must hire \nanother rider.  \n \nAn example is when he says, \"Rent me an animal I can use to get \nto such-and-such a place.\" If the animal dies, the one who rented it \nto him must replace it because the uses are his responsibility and \nnot connected to this particular animal. If the rider dies, i.e. when \nsomeone rents an animal and pays for it and then dies, the rent is \nnot canceled. His heirs rent the animal for someone who is like \nhim in ability and condition.  \n \n34.23h Destruction of implements  \n \nIf someone rents a household implement or something else, \nhe is not liable for it if it is destroyed or lost while in his \npossession. His word is believed about that until it can be \nproven that he is lying.  \n \n\"Implement\" [ma'un] is a general term for utensils in the house, \nlike pots, platters, axes, and sieves. \"Something else\" would be like \na garment or riding animal. If he says it is destroyed, the one who \nrented is believed unless there is evidence to the contrary and \nthen he is liable. This is like when he says, \"It was destroyed at \nthe beginning of the month,\" and then it is seen with him after \nthat. It is understood by \"in his possession\" that if he removes it \nfrom his possession and it was destroyed by someone else, he is \nliable since he rented it to someone not trustworthy or someone \nheavier or more injurious than him.  \n \n34.23i Artisans' responsibility  \n \nArtisans are responsible for things they lose, whether they \nare working for a wage or not.  \n \nArtisans are those who set themselves up to work for their \nlivelihood, like tailors. They are responsible for the value of things \nthey lose, assessed on the day they took possession of those things, \nand receive no wage for the work they did on them, i.e. because \nthey are responsible for the value of the item before any work \ndone on it. It states in the Mawwaziyya, \"The owner cannot say, 'I \nwill pay the wage and take its value after the work.'\" Shaikh ibn \nRushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Unless the artisan confirms \nthat he lost it after the work was done.\"  \n \n34.23j Bath house owners  \n \nThe owner of a public bath house is not liable [for \nbelongings lost by clients].  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that his words mean \nthat he is renting out and is not a guard for the clothing. Abdullah \nibn Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated the opposite of this. He \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that the owner of a bath house is a guard \nof the belongings, whether he guards them for a fee or without a \nfee. This is where they are stolen or destroyed by the command of \nAllah azza wa jall. As for when he says, \"A man came and asked \nfor them and I thought that he was their owner and so I gave \nthem to him,\" then he is liable. The same applies when he says, \"I \nsaw the one who took them and I thought that he was their \nowner.\" Shaikh ibn al-Musayyab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The \nowner of the bath house is responsible, and that is what Imam \nAbu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) said.  \n \n34.23k Ship owners  \n \nThe owner of a ship is not liable [for lost cargo or damage]. \nA ship owner is not paid his hire until he delivers his \ncargo.  \n \nHe is not liable for the ship floundering because of wind or waves. \nHe does not receive his hire until he delivers the cargo because the \nfee for the ship is one that of hire. If the aim is not achieved, the \nfare is not deserved. It is said that he is paid a fare according to \nhow far the ship traveled. That seems likely because it is more \nappropriate to connect the rent of the ship to hire than to connect \nit to piece-work because the end is known and the wage is known \nand so he is paid according to the distance traveled.  \n \n34.24 Partnership of labor and capital  \n \n34.24a. Partnership of labor  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in a having partnership in physical \nlabor when the partners work in the same place with the \nsame work, or do work that is similar.  \n \nIt is the permission of each of the two partners to work together. \nThe evidence for that is in the Sahih from Zuhra ibn Ma'bad \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu). He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) used to go out to the \nmarket with his grandfather to buy food. Abdullah ibn Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and ibn az-Zubayr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) would \nmeet him and say to him, \"Be our partner. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) prayed for you to have blessing,\" so he \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) would be their partner. Often he would get a \ncamel's load as profit and sent it home.  \n \nThey work in the same place with the same work. This is the \nposition of the Mudawwana. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) explains it as being well-known. The 'Utbiyya allows it to be \nin several places when the work they do is the same. The author of \nthe Mukhtasar says that it well-known. The same sort of work is \nlike two tailors. \"Close\" means that the work of one of them \ndepends on the work of the other, as when one prepares the \nspinning to be woven and the other does the weaving. When the \nwork is different and not similar, like a tailor and blacksmith, \npartnership is not permitted because of the uncertainty since the \nwork of this one rather than that one may be sold and he will take \nwhat he is not entitled to from his companion.  \n \n34.24b. Partnership of capital  \n \nA partnership in pooled capital is permitted provided the \nprofit is shared between according to the size of the \ninvestment of each of them. The work of each is also in \nproportion to percentage of the profit stipulated for him. It \nis not permitted to share the profit equally if their \ninvestments differ.  \n \nCapital partnership is in dinars and dirhams invested by both \nsides by consensus, and by food with the same description and \ncategory according to Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nwhile Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) forbade that, i.e. forbade \nthat with the same description, category and amount, let alone \ndifferent ones.  \n \nWhen it is said that it is permitted, the profit shared between \nthem and the work is in proportion to the size of the investment. \nFor instance, if one of them pays 100 and the other 200, the profit \nand loss is divided into thirds between them.  \n \n34.25 Investment loans [qard]  \n \n34.25a. Investment loans [qirad] are made with money  \n \nAn investment loan [qirad] is permitted with dirhams and \ndinars, and it is also allowed with unminted gold and \nsilver.  \n \nThere are certain preconditions for a qirad. One is that it be in \ngold or silver, whether that is done by number or weight.   \n \n34.25b. Investment loans are not made in merchandise  \n \nA qirad made in goods is not permitted. In such a case, the \nborrower is like an employee who sells them. If he then \ntrades with the price, this then becomes an investment \nloan.  \n \nAn investment loan cannot be in any weighed or measured things \nbecause the basic root of the qirad is uncertainty because the \nwage is unknown since the agent does not know whether or not he \nwill have a profit. Its amount is according to the profit. The \ninvestor does not know whether there is a profit or not and \nwhether or not he will get his capital back. That is uncertainty \nbecause of these aspects. However the Lawgiver allowed it out of \nnecessity since the people needed to transact trade with it. That \namount of it which the Lawgiver permitted is what is permitted. It \nconsists of minted cash or what has the same ruling in the form of \npieces of gold and silver.  \n \nIf this actually happens, then the agent becomes an employee. \nWhen he trades with the price, that is a qirad. It says in the \nMukhtasar that his wage is the like of what he would get for \nselling the goods. As for his work in the qirad after that, he has \nthe profit from such a qirad, if there is a profit. Otherwise he has \nnothing.  \n \nThen he explained the matters over which the agent has control \nrather than the investor.  \n \n34.25c Expenses  \n \nThe agent has a right to clothing and food if he travels \nwith a considerable amount of capital. He is only entitled \nto clothing for a long trip.  \n \nThis is mandatory. What is meant are his expenses for a return \njourney, with two conditions. One is the journey, and it must be \none by which he intends to make the investment grow. If he \ntravels with it to visit his family or to go on hajj, he is not entitled \nto any expenses. The other is that the capital is considerable. The \njourney can be short or long in respect of food. There is no clothing \nentitlement for a short journey when the money is a lot and not \njust a little. A short journey is the distance of up to ten days and \nthe definition of a lot of property is fifty dinars or more.  \n \n34.25d Division of profits  \n \nThe profit is not divided until the capital is in cash.  \n \nIt means that it converted to gold or silver. A example of that is \nwhen he sells some goods and still has some which is the capital. \nIf he is told to then divide that which is cash, that is not permitted \nbecause the remaining goods may be destroyed.  \n \n34.26 Leasing an orchard or plantation [musaqa]  \n \n34.26a. A musaqa is permitted  \n \nLeasing an orchard or plantation of trees is permitted, \nprovided that the two parties agree on the shares.  \n \nIt means that someone hands over his grapevines or date palms, \nfor instance, to someone who attends to whatever they require of \nirrigation and work on the basis that the crop which Allah azza \nwa jall grants is divided in half between them or for a known \nportion of the fruit, like a third or a fourth. Its ruling is that it is \npermitted according to what is in the two Sahih Collections which \nstates that Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) employed the \npeople of Khaybar for half of what it produced of fruits or crops. It \nis an exception to arable sharecropping, which is renting out land \nfor what is produces, selling fruits and hiring them before they are \ngood and before they exist, which is part of hire for something \nunknown.  \n \nIt has certain preconditions. There must be two parties, and they \nmust be capable of hire. The expression saqa [whose root is \nirrigation] is used, and it is not contracted for mutual trade and \nthe like. It made on immovable property [i.e. the trees] and it \nwould appear that it is not permitted in anything else. This is not \nthe case. It is valid for in the case of crops like sugar cane, onions \nand cucumbers with certain conditions. One is that the owner of \nthe crops is unable to attend to them. The second is that he fears \nthe crop will die due to lack of irrigation. The third is that it has \nappeared from the ground. The fourth is that its ripeness has not \nyet appeared because then it would be permitted to sell it and so \nthere is no need for musaqa. Part it is that he does it for known \nportion, whether a lot like two-thirds, or a little, like a fourth.  \n \nThey must agree on the division of the shares. If he does it for \ncertain number of sa's or wasqs, that is not permitted.  \n \n34.26b The labor is done by the lessee  \n \nAll the work is done by the lessee. No other work can be \nstipulated for him other than that entailed by the musaqa \n[irrigation] and nor is he required to start any work in the \norchard unless it is of no consequence, like mending a \nfence and repairing a reservoir, without that involving \nactually initiating the work.  \n \nThe work consists of tending to what the fruits require in the form \nof irrigation, pollination, fertilization, pruning, and repairing tools \nin the form of buckets, spades, and so forth. The owner cannot \nstipulate other work, like buying a garment for him and similar \njobs which have nothing to do with the fruit. He cannot stipulate \ninitiating any new work unless it is inconsequential, like mending \nan existing fence of the garden or mending the reservoir. It is not \npermitted to stipulate that he build it from scratch because that \nwill remain after the fruit.  \n \n34.26c Tasks which can be stipulated  \n \nPollination of the trees is done by the lessee as well as \ncleaning the places where the water settles among the \ntrees, mending the place where the water falls from the \nbucket, cleaning the water source and similar tasks.  \n \nPollination is buying what is used for fertilization and attaching it \nto the trees. That is the school. Cleaning the water source is to \nremove dirt or leaves from it. Similar tasks include pruning and \ndrying.  \n \n34.26d Work animals may not be removed  \n \nThe musaqa does not permit the expulsion of animals in \nthe orchard. If some of them die, then the owner must \nreplace them. The lessee must maintain the animals and \nthe employees.  \n \nThe Mudawwana states that the owner of the garden cannot grant \nthe musaqa contract and then stipulate the removal of any of the \nslaves or animals from the garden. Shaikh Bahram (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"This is a prohibition, not simple dislike.\" If animals \nin the garden die, the owner must replace them, even if the \nworker has not stipulated that because the contract is based on \nwork on that which is the responsibility of the owner of the garden \nin respect to those animals on which the contract occurred when \nthey are in the garden. If the owner stipulates that the agent has \nto replace them, that is not allowed. The agent must fodder the \nanimals and clothe and feed the employees according to the well-\nknown position because he owes the work and all the burdens \nconnected to it.  \n \n34.26e Cultivating un-planted parts of the orchard  \n \nThe lessee should cultivate the unplanted area if it is \nslight, but there is no harm in leaving that up to the lessee, \nand this is the most lawful course. If there is a lot of \nunplanted land, it is not permitted to include it in the \nmusaqa contract of the orchard. It can only be included if \nis it is a third or less of the orchard.  \n \nUn-planted land is land which is free of trees. A third or less is a \nslight amount. The owner can cancel that. If it is a lot, he is not \npart of the musaqa of the palm trees.  \n \nSo a small area of unplanted land can be part of the musaqa with \nthe above preconditions. If it is not mentioned or stipulated in the \ncontract, it is the responsibility of the agent. The contract is void if \nthe owner stipulates that it is his if the agent irrigates it, as the \ncontract is void is it includes a lot of unplanted land or it is \nstipulated that it belongs to the agent [in the case of palm trees]. \nIt belongs to the owner. As far as a lot or a little is concerned, it is \nin respect of all the fruits, not in respect to the share of the agent \nalone.  \n \n34.27 A farming partnership  \n \n34.27a Sharecropping is permitted  \n \nIt is permitted to have a sharecropping partnership if both \nparties share in the cultivation and the profit is shared \nbetween them, whether one owns the land and the other \ndoes the work, or the work and rent are shared between \nthem, or they both own the land.  \n \nSome call it muzara'a. The Shaikh (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nmentioned eight cases in this topic: four are permitted, three are \nmentioned in order and the fourth delayed, and four are forbidden, \none of which is understood and three are stated.  \n \nAs for the three which are permitted, he mentioned the first here, \nwhich is when one owns the land and the other does the work. \nThat is when there is equality with the rent of the land in value, \nor close to it, as when the value of the land is 19 and the work 20 \nor the reverse. If they are far apart, it is not permitted.  \n \nThe second is when the work and rent are shared between them.  \n \nThe third is when they both own the land.  \n \nThen he moves to the forbidden three cases which are mentioned:  \n \n34.27b Forbidden forms of sharecropping  \n \nIf one provides the seeds and the other owns the land, with \nthe profit to be shared between them, that is not permitted, \nwhether one or both do the work.  \n \nOne case is when one of them provides the seed and the other the \nland and the work. Another case is when one of them provides the \nseed and the work and the other the land. The third case is when \none provides the land and the seed and they both do the work.  \n \nThen he indicates the fourth of the permitted cases and says:  \n \n34.27c Another permitted form  \n \nIf they both rent the land and the seed comes from one and \nthe work from the other, it is permitted if the values of the \ntwo undertakings are close.  \n \nOr it is jointly owned, or it belongs to one and the other pays him \nthe rent for half. This is when the cost of the seeds and the work \nare close. If they are not close then it is not permitted. That is the \nfourth forbidden case.  \n \n34.27d. Rental of land with uncertain irrigation  \n \nNo payment is made on renting land whose irrigation is \nuncertain until it is watered.  \n \nThis is like land watered by rain and land with a small spring. If \nirrigation is secure, like land watered by a river near a large sea, \nand like land watered by rain in the east, then when the contract \nof rental is made, it can be paid, even if it is for a long time, like \n30 years.  \n \n34.28 Liability for damage to crops sold and not yet \nclaimed  \n \n34.28a The effect of damage to crops  \n \nIf anyone buys fruit still on the trees, and then a third or \nmore of it is destroyed by cold, locusts, frost or something \nelse, the cost of that is deducted from the price the buyer \npays. If it is less than a third, then the buyer bears the loss.  \n \nHe buys the fruit after it appears but before it is fully ripe. Other \nthings which can damage the crop are like wind, snow, armies and \nthieves. It is related by Shaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"When a man \nbuys fruits and then blight befalls it and a third of the fruit is lost, \nthe liability is obliged for the owner.\" This is when the cause is \nother than lack of water. When it is due to lack of water, then \nthere is no limit. It is reduced, be it a little or a lot, whether they \nare watered from spring or by rain because irrigation is the \nresponsibility of the seller, and is part of the discharge of his \nresponsibility.  \n \n \n34.28b When there is no reduction  \n \nThere is no crop damage in a crop or what is bought after \nthe fruit has been dried.  \n \nThat is because it is only sold after it is dry. The delay until after \nit has been dried is neglect on the part of the buyer.  \n \n34.28c Damage to vegetables  \n \nThere is a reduction in crop damage to vegetables, even if \nit is little. It is also said that there is only a reduction if a \nthird is damaged.  \n \nThis is like onions and chard because the damage is usually due to \nlack of water.  \n \n34.29 Gift of fruit which can be dried ['ariyya]  \n \n34.29a The 'ariyya  \n \nIf someone gives a man an 'ariyya [a grant] of the fruit of \npalm trees from his garden, there is no harm in him buying \nthem when they are ripe in exchange for dry dates, based \non estimation of their measure.  \n \nThis is when he gives someone – whether a man, woman or child – \nthe fruits as an 'ariyya, which is granting him the crop which is \nstill on those trees. It is not valid if it is a simple gift. When they \nare ripe, the giver can buy then by estimating their measure. The \nform of that is that it is said, \"How much is on this palm tree of \nwasqs?\" It is said, \"It is five or more.\" Then it is asked, \"How much \nwill that be reduced when they are dried?\" and the reply is a wasq \nor more. If something like five wasqs or less remain after that, it \nis allowed, and if it is than that, it is not permitted in exchange for \ndried dates of the same type.  \n \n34.29b When they are cut  \n \nHe given that when they are cut, if it is five wasqs or less. \nIt is not permitted to buy more than five wasqs except with \nmoney or merchandise.  \n \nThis is not meant that it is not a precondition that it is immediate. \nThey either agree to full payment when they are cut or are silent \non it. A precondition of immediate payment might entail harm. As \nfor immediate payment without it is being stipulated, there is no \nharm. The limitation of five or less only applies to one who \ngranted the 'ariyya. He can buy them with cash or goods. \n \n  \n \nChapter 35. Bequests and Freeing Slaves \n \n[Tadbir, Kitaba, Emancipation, the umm walad and wala']  \n \n \nThere are six topics in this chapter, each of which has a reality, a \nruling and other matters.  \n \nThe first concerns bequests [wasaya]. In the usage of the fuqaha' \nit is a contract which creates entitlements to the third of his estate \nwhich a person can dispose of and which become binding when he \ndies. They disagree about whether that is obligatory or \nrecommended. Most scholars think that it is mandatory, as is \nexpressed here.  \n \n35.1 Bequests  \n \n35.1a The right to make a bequest  \n \nIt is imperative for someone who has property to prepare a \nwill.  \n \nIt should be witnessed. If it is not witnessed, it is invalid, even if it \nis found in his writing unless he says, \"Carry out the document \nyou find in my handwriting.\" Then it is carried out.  \n \n35.1b No bequest to a heir  \n \nThere can be no bequest in favor of an heir.  \n \nHe either means the fact that it is not sound or that it is simply \nprohibited, The position of the School is that it is not valid, even if \nit is less than a third. If the other heirs do allow, it is made a gift \nfrom him.  \n \n35.1c Bequests are from the disposable third  \n \nBequests are made from the disposable third. Anything \nwhich exceeds that is rejected unless the heirs allow it.  \n \nThat which the person who makes a will can dispose of is a third, \nor it means that the one making the will cannot dispose of more \nthan a third. If it is more than a third, even a small amount, it is \nonly allowed by the permission of the heirs when they are sane \nand adult.  \n \nThe third is calculated on the day of death, not the day when the \nwill is read, according to what Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) states. Shaikh ibn 'Abdu's-Salam (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ncounters him by saying that it is contrary to the school. \"What the \nSchool considers in the bequest is that it is taken from the third \non the day the bequests are carried out, not the day of death, so \nthat if the third covers all the bequests on the day he dies and \nthen a blight befalls the property and destroys some of it so that \nthe third does not cover them, then the ruling on the day of the \ndivision is that of someone who has willed away more than a \nthird. I do not know of any disagreement about that in the school.\"  \n \n35.1d Emancipation takes priority  \n \nIn the disposable third, one begins with freeing a \nparticular slave.  \n \nHe deals with the order with which one deals with bequests. The \nfirst is the emancipation of a particular slave, whether he owns \nthat slave or someone else owns him, as when he says, \"Buy the \nslave of so-and-so and free him.\" We mentioned that this is first in \nthe bequests, but when there is a bequest about unpaid zakat or \nkaffarah, that takes precedence over emancipation.  \n \n35.1e The order of precedence  \n \nNext is priority freeing a mudabbar when the tadbir \ndeclaration was made when the master was healthy. This \nprecedes emancipation or any other bequests made when \nhe was ill, including unpaid zakat.  \n \nA bequest to pay zakat is taken from the third before other \nbequests, but a tadbir made when the master was healthy \ntakes precedence over it.  \n \nIf he did not mention unpaid zakat in the will, it is not paid from \nthe third.  \n \n35.1f When there is not enough in the third to cover all \nbequests  \n \nIt the third is not enough for then the people of shares who \nhave no precedence receive proportional shares of the rest.  \n \nThis is the same principle as 'awl [adjustment] in shares of \ninheritance. For instance, take the case when the deceased willed \none man half of his property and another a quarter. You compare \nthe position of the half and the fourth and see what is between \nthem and you find that the common factor is a quarter. You take \nthe half and fourth and combine them and so they are three and \nyou know the third is divided into three shares between them, one \nshare for the one with a fourth and two for the one with a half. \nThis is when the heirs do not allow the bequests. If they allow \nthem, then the one with the bequest takes the half and the other a \nfourth, and the rest is taken by the heirs.  \n \n35.1g Revoking a bequest  \n \nA man may revoke his bequest of emancipation or other \nthings.  \n \nEven if he is a fool and whether he is healthy or ill. The same \napplies to women and children, He can retract a bequest whether \nhe is healthy or ill, as it states in Tahqiq al-Mabani from Shaikh \nal-Fakhani \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nShaikh \nBahram \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). He can retract it, even if he testified in his \nwill that he would not retract it. That is the 'amal in this.  \n \n35.2 Tadbir: an undertaking to free a slave at the master's \ndeath or a certain date  \n \n35.2a. Definition of tadbir  \n \nA tadbir is contracted when a man says to his slave, \"You \nare mudabbar\" or \"You are free afterwards,\" [i.e. after my \ndeath]  \n \nTaken the departure (idbar or dabr) of life. The root means what \nis behind something. Tadbir is recommended. One of its \npreconditions is the form with which it is made, like saying, \"You \nare free after my death\" or \"You are free on the day I die.\" The \nslave must be of age to be considered responsible and sane. It is \nnot sound to grant it to a mad person or a child even if he has \ndiscrimination.  \n \n35.2b Status of a mudabbar slave  \n \nThen he is not permitted to sell such slave, but he is still \nentitled to his work and, as long as the master is not ill, he \ncan confiscate the slave's possessions. If it is a slavegirl, he \ncan have intercourse with her.  \n \nIf he sells such a slave, the sale is invalid and the slave remains a \nmudabbar as long as the sale is not connected to emancipation. If \nit is connected to emancipation and the buyer emancipates him, \nhe is free and he has his wala', i.e. if he sets him free while the \nmaster is alive. If the sale is carried out with emancipation, the \none who set free has the wala'. If he is freed after the death of the \none of the one gave him the tadbir, it is not carried out because \nthe wala' is connected to the one who granted the tadbir.  \n \nThe master is entitled to his work until he dies because he is his \nmaster. If the master is ill and may die, he cannot confiscate the \nslave's property because that is removing his property for someone \nelse.  \n \nHe can have intercourse with a slavegirl because the basic \nprinciple is that she is allowed. If she becomes pregnant, she \nbecomes a umm walad who is freed from his main estate [rather \nthan from the disposable third] after his death.  \n \n35.2c A slavegirl due to be freed at a certain time  \n \nHe cannot have intercourse with a slavegirl who will be set \nfree a certain date nor can he sell her. He can demand her \nwork and can confiscate her possessions as long as the \nterm for her emancipation is not near.  \n \nThis is like when he says, \"Serve me for a year and then you are \nfree\" because the term may come before his death and so she will \nbe free. If he has intercourse with her she may become pregnant \nand then would only be free after his death [as a umm walad]. \nSuch a relationship in this case resembles a mu'ta marriage [a \ntemporary marriage because it has a term at which it ends]. If a \nslavegirl has a term fixed for her, he must not have intercourse \nwith her, or give her away or give her as charity because she has \none of the contracts of emancipation.  \n \nThe Hashiyat al-'Adawi notes that if he does have intercourse \nwith her, he is disciplined for that, but is not subject to a hadd \npunishment.  \n \nShe can work for him since she is still his property until the end of \nthe term. He can confiscate her possessions which she has, for \ninstance as a gift from him, but this is restricted to when the term \nof emancipation is not near. There is no definition of near.  \n \nThe Hashiyat al-'Adawi notes that there is a second position \nabout \"near\" and that it is about a month.  \n \n35.2d The freeing of a mudabbar is from the disposable \nthird  \n \nWhen the master dies, the emancipation of the mudabbar \ncomes out of the disposable third, while a slave promised \nfreedom at a certain date comes from the total estate.  \n \nPriority in the disposable third of the estate is given to a slave \ngiven a tadbir when the deceased was healthy. Then comes the \nslave given a tadbir when he was ill. If someone has been set a \ndate at which he will be free, he is different to the mudabbar and \nis set free from the capital of the estate.  \n \n35.3 Kitaba: the agreement to free a slave on payment by \nagreed installments  \n \n35.3a. The kitaba agreement  \n \nA slave with a kitaba [mukatib] remains a slave as long as \nhe still owes anything. The kitaba agreement is permitted \nwhen made with the agreement of the slave and master for \nan amount to be paid in installments, however many or few \nthey are.  \n \nNo matter how little is outstanding of the payments, the mukatib \nis still a slave since it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"The mukatib remains a slave as long as a \nsingle dirham of his kitaba is outstanding.\"  \n \nKitaba is the emancipation of a slave in return for money paid in \ninstallments. There is no disagreement that it is permitted. The \nBook indicates its legality: \"If any slaves you own desire to make a \ncontract to free themselves, write it for them if you know of good in \nthem.\" (Holy Qur‟an 24:33) The precondition is that the payment \nbe done in installments. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nreported from the Mudawanna, \"It is not immediate and the \ninstallments are stipulated, like x amount every month or every \nyear based on their mutual agreement.\"  \n \nIn al-Jawahir Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Our scholars \nsay that an immediately paid kitaba is permitted. It is analogous \nto a sale in which both immediacy and deferral are accepted.\"  \n \n35.3b When the slave defaults  \n \nIf he is unable to pay, he reverts to a full slave and the \nmaster can keep what he has already received. The slave \ncan only be deemed insolvent by the sultan after failing to \npay if he refuses to acknowledge his insolvency.  \n \nNone of him is free. The master keeps what he paid because he is \nhis slave. If the slave acknowledges his inability to pay, he \nautomatically reverts to full slave status.  \n \n35.4 Children and the property of slaves  \n \n35.4a Status of the children of women slaves  \n \nIf a woman has a kitaba or tadbir agreement, or a date is \nset for her emancipation, or she is pledged as security, any \nchild she bears shares her status.  \n \nHer children have her status whether the child is conceived in \nmarriage or by fornication. If the father is the master, the child is \nfree without dispute if the master is free. If the father is a slave, it \nis slave like her in all her rulings of emancipation, work, sales and \nthe like.  \n \n35.4b Status of children of a umm walad by other than the \nmaster  \n \nThe children of an umm walad fathered by other than her \nmaster have the same status as her.  \n \nThis about any children she has after she becomes a umm walad. \nThere is no disagreement about that in the School. As for children \nshe had before she became umm walad, they remain slaves.  \n \n35.4c The possessions of slaves  \n \nA slave's property belongs to him his unless the master \nconfiscates it. If the master frees him or grants him a \nkitaba and does not exclude the slave's property, then he \ncannot confiscate it.  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it appears from \nwhat he says that he actually owns it, and so there are two \nsecondary rulings from his words. One is that he is permitted to \nhave intercourse with his slavegirl since he owns her. The second \nis that a slave is obliged to pay zakat on the property in his \npossession. The well-known position, however, is that a slave does \nnot pay zakat.  \n \nThe Hashiyya of al-'Adawi points that his ownership of \nproperty is not, in fact, complete.  \n \nIt is agreed about anything he earns property after the contract of \nkitaba. According to the School, it applies to what he earned \nbefore the contract.  \n \n35.4d A slavegirl with a kitaba  \n \nThe master cannot have intercourse with a slavegirl who \nhas a kitaba contract.  \n \nThat is because her person and property are protected. If he does \nhave intercourse with her, the hadd is not imposed on him in the \nwell-known position, He is punished unless he is excused due to \nignorance or error and he does not owe any bride-price. If she is a \nvirgin or he forces her, he owes the amount of her depreciation. It \nstates in al-Jawahir, \"If she becomes pregnant, she can choose \nbetween insolvency and become an umm walad or continue with \nthe rest of her kitaba. If she chooses insolvency, she becomes a \numm walad. If she chooses to pay the rest of her kitaba, she is the \nmother of a child and a mukatiba [which means that the master is \nresponsible for her maintenance while she is pregnant]. When she \npays the installments, she is free. Otherwise she is free when the \nmaster dies.  \n \n35.4e Children of a slave with a kitaba  \n \nAny children born to a man or woman slave with a kitaba \ncontract after they have concluded a kitaba have the \nstatus and they are free when the parents are free.  \n \n35.5 Freeing a group by kitaba  \n \nIt is permitted for a group to have a kitaba but they only \nfree when the entire sum is paid.  \n \nThis is a single contract when they belong to the same master. \nThey pay according to their ability to pay on the day of the \ncontract of the kitaba was made.  \n \n35.6 Restrictions on a mukatib  \n \nA slave with a kitaba cannot free his own slaves or waste \nhis property until he is free. He cannot marry nor \nundertake a long journey without his master's permission.  \n \nHe can not get rid of his property without recompense for it, as \nthrough gifts and sadaqa, if that considerable. The reason for that \nis that it would be injurious to his master and it might lead to his \ninability to pay. He cannot undertake a long journey in which his \ninstallments will become due before he returns. Shaikh al-Aqfashi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the permission of his master refers \nto both marriage and travel. He can do it with his master's \npermission.  \n \n35.7 Children of a deceased mukatib  \n \n35.7a The status of the children of a mukatib when he dies  \n \nIf the slave with a kitaba dies leaving a child, he takes his \nplace and pays from his estate whatever is still unpaid \nwhich becomes immediately due. His children inherit any \nremaining property.  \n \nHis children who are part of the contract take his place, but that \nis not paid in installments. It is due immediately and is paid from \nhis estate if he left enough to cover the installments or more, \nbecause his responsibility ends at death, like all deferred debts.  \n \n35.7b If there is not enough to cover it  \n \nIf there is not enough to settle the amount, the children \nshould trade with what there is and pay it off in \ninstallments if they are adults. If they are children, and the \nestate is not enough to cover the installments until they \ncome of age and can trade, they revert to being full slaves.  \n \nAdult children continue to pay the installments if they have the \nability to work and can be trusted with the money. Otherwise the \nmoney is put with a trustee who pays on their behalf. If they are \nminors and there is enough to cover the installments until they \ncome of age, they are not made full slaves, but the money is lodged \nwith a trustee who pays the master his installments.  \n \n35.7c If the mukatib has no children  \n \nIf he does not have any children in his kitaba, his master \ninherits from him.  \n \nAnd there is not enough to cover the debt, the master is the heir \nby virtue of him being a slave, not by the wala', since he dies a \nslave.  \n \n35.8 Umm Walads  \n \nA umm walad is a slavegirl who has borne her master a child.  \n \n35.8a When a man has a child by his slavegirl  \n \nIf a man has child by a slavegirl, he can enjoy her while he \nis alive and then she is set free from the main estate when \nhe dies.  \n \nHe is permitted to enjoy her by the words of Allah, \"Or those they \nown as slaves, in which case they are not blameworthy.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 23:6) The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) had such a \nrelationship with Maria the Copt. When the man dies, his umm \nwalad is set free first, without any requiring any legal ruling and \ncannot be enslaved on account of his debts, whether they existed \nbefore or after her pregnancy.  \n \n35.8b Her status  \n \nHe is not permitted to sell her or demand her work or \ndemand revenue from her. He may, however, demand that \nfrom her child by another man.  \n \nIf he does sell her, the sale is void, even if the buyer frees her or \ntakes her as a umm walad or she dies. The buyer is given the price \nback. The same applies to gifts, pledges and the like. He can not \noblige a lot of work from her, but can oblige minor work like \ngrinding flour and fetching water. He cannot make her work for \nsomeone else, but he can do that with her other children.  \n \n35.8c Her children's status  \n \nSuch a child has the same status as his mother regarding \nemancipation and is free when she is free.  \n \nThis refers to her children by other than the master. This is when \nthe master dies when she is alive. If she dies before him, her \nchildren are not free until the master dies.  \n \n35.8d Miscarriages  \n \nAny miscarriage known to be a child makes her an umm \nwalad.  \n \n No matter whether it is a lump or clot, and even clotted blood, \naccording to the well-known position.  \n \nThis has two preconditions. The first is that the master admits to \nhaving had intercourse with her, and the second is that, in the \nabsence of the child, two women testify to the birth or miscarriage.  \n \n35.8e Denial of paternity  \n \nHe cannot claim coitus interruptus in order to deny \npaternity of the child if he admits to having had \nintercourse with her. If he claims that he has observed \nistibra' and not had intercourse with her afterwards, the \npaternity of her child born after that is not attributed to \nhim.  \n \nCoitus interruptus is withdrawal before ejaculation. It does not \nremove the paternity because even a small amount of semen can \nresult in conception.  \nIf he has observed istibra', which is remaining apart from her for \nat least one menstrual period or more, then in the famous position \nthe child is not attributed to him. He is not obliged to take an oath \nin that [about having observed istibra'.]  \n \n35.9 Obstacle of a slave's debts  \n \nIt is not permitted for someone whose property is covered \nby debts to set a slave free.  \n \nFreeing slaves is one of the greatest devotional acts one can do to \ndraw near to Allah. It is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"If someone frees a believing slave, Allah \nazza wa jall will save a limb of his from the Fire for every limb of \nhis.\" In one version, \"a limb of his from the fire for every limb of \nhis, even his genitals for his genitals.\" Freeing a man is better.  \n \nEmancipation has three pillars.  \n \n1. The first is the person frees, who must be adult and sane \nwith no legal restrictions on his dealings and not having \ndebts that take up all his property, An emancipation done \nby a child, madman or one legal restricted from financial \ndealings is not permitted. Nor is it permitted if his debts \ncover all his property, whether those debts are immediate \nor deferred because then he would be disposing of \nsomeone else's property.  \n \n2. The second is the slave, who can be a full slave or one \nwith some degree of freedom, like a mudabbar.  \n \n \n3. The third is the form which indicates removal of ownership \nas, \"You are free.\"  \n \n35.10 Freeing part of a slave  \n \n35.10a Someone who frees part of a slave frees all of him  \n \nIf someone frees part of his slave, he is made to free all of \nhim.  \n \nAs when he frees a fourth, third or half. He is judged to have freed \nall of him not just part of him, when the slave set free is Muslim \nsane, sensible with no debts and when the slave has one master.   \n \n35.10b If there is more than one master  \n \nIf someone else has a share in the slave, the share of his \npartner is estimated on the day the emancipation is \nsettled, and the slave is free. If he does not have the money \nto pay the partner, the portion of the partner in the slave \nremains.  \n \nThe one who set free his part must pay the partner the price \nwhich is assessed on the day of the judgment of emancipation if \nthere is judgment in it. Then the emancipation depends on the \nruling issued for it, not by the simple freeing of part of the slave. If \nthe person is wealthy, he pays the share of the partner on the day \nof the judgment. If he is not wealthy on the day of the judgment, \nthen the slave remains a slave unless his remaining master frees \nhim. If he has enough to pay for part of the share of the partner, it \nis estimated according to what he has.  \n \n35.11 Freeing because of mutilation  \n \nIf someone mutilates his slave clearly, such as cutting off a \nlimb and the like, the slave is set free.  \n \nLike a foot, hand or like a testicle. Then the master is obliged to \nfree him, even if that was intended to increase the price since he \ntortured him by doing that. Similar to cutting off a limb is gouging \nout an eye or the branding his face or elsewhere with fire. He is \nfreed from his estate. It appears from his words that he is freed \nautomatically on account of the mutilation, and Ashhab says that. \nIbn al-Qasim says that he is only freed by a ruling.  \n \nShaikh al-'Adawi (rahmatullahi alaihi): There is disagreement \nabout whether the master is punished by beating and \nimprisonment or whether the punishment is the enforced \nemancipation of the slave.  \n \n35.12 Freeing because of kinship  \n \nIf someone obtains ownership of his parents, his children \nor grandchildren, grandfather or grandmother, or uterine, \npaternal or full brother, that slave is freed automatically.  \n \nThis applies to relationship by blood or by suckling. All he \nmentioned is automatic and does not require a ruling in the well-\nknown position provided that he does not have debts which would \ntake up the price. If he has debts which would take up the price, \nhe cannot free him by that and nor sell nor can remain the owner \nof such a relative. Rather he is sold for him to cover the debt.  \n \n35.13 Freeing which is a consequence  \n \nIf someone frees a pregnant woman, her unborn child is \nfree with her.  \n \nWhether the child is by marriage or fornication. The child is free \nbecause every child who comes by marriage or fornication without \nownership follows the mother in freedom or slavedom.  \n \n35.14 Freeing because of a legal obligation  \n \nIn freeing slave to discharge an obligation, one may not \nfree a slave who is the process of being freed, like one with \na tadbir or a kitaba or something similar, nor one who is \nblind, or has had a hand or the like amputated, or a non-\nMuslim, a child, or someone who is subject to enforced \nguardianship.  \n \nThis is on account of obligations like the kaffarah for killing [and \nthat for dhihar divorce or for breaking the fast of Ramadan].  \n \nCategories who cannot be freed for this also include an umm \nwalad, someone with a date at which they will be free or someone \nwho is partially free, because it is muddled with the contract of \nliberation. [Only full slaves fulfill the obligation.]  \n \nFurthermore in satisfying the obligation, one cannot free \namputees since that decreases the value of the slave by the defect. \nIt cannot be a non-Muslim because Allah azza wa jall says, \"a \nbelieving slave\". It cannot be a child because he is not one of the \npeople of responsibility. Nor can someone debarred from dealing \nwith his own finances, who is a fool who spends his money \nimproperly.  \n \n35.16 Wala' [Clientage] \n \nThis gives the one who has this has what is tantamount to an \nagnate relationship to the former slave, i.e. as if he were related to \nhim via the father.  \n \n35.16a The one who receives the wala'  \n \nThe wala' belongs to the one who sets a slave free. It is not \npermitted to sell it or give it away.  \n \nThe person who removes ownership by liberating a slave becomes \nhis mawla if the one who is freed the slave is a Muslim. If the one \nwho freed is an unbeliever and he frees a Muslim, he has no wala' \nrelationship to his freed Muslim. The wala' then goes to the \ncommunity of Muslims. If the person then becomes Muslim, the \nwala' does not revert to him. The basis for this principle is found \nin the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The \nwala' belongs to one who sets free.\" It cannot be disposed of \nbecause of what Shaikh ibn Hibban (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nothers related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"The wala' is flesh like the flesh of lineage. It is not sold or given \naway.\"  \n \n35.16b Freeing on behalf of someone  \n \nIf someone frees a slave on behalf of another man, that \nman still has the wala'.  \n \nIf the man who ordered the emancipation is free. If he is slave, \nthen his master has the wala'.  \n \n35.16c The one who receives a shahadah  \n \nIf someone becomes Muslim at someone's hand, the wala' \ndoes not go to him, but to the Muslims as a whole.  \n \nWhen an unbeliever says the shahadah with someone, that person \ndoes not receive the wala' of that person [because the wala' only \nbelongs to the person who emancipates.  \n \n35.16d Women receiving the wala'  \n \nWhen a woman sets a slave free, she has the wala' of that \nperson as well as the wala' of the person's children and \nany slaves that person frees. In the case of someone she \nhas not set free, she does not inherit the wala' from her \nfather, son, husband or anyone else.  \n \nShe has the wala' of their children and freed slaves because she is \nthe initial emancipator and that is attributed ultimately to her. \nThe wala' is inherited via the agnatic male line and not the \nfemale.  \n \n35.16e Inheritance of a slave with no wala'  \n \nThe estate left by a slave without a wali [sa'iba] goes to the \nMuslim community.  \n \nThis is the sa'iba. Such a status comes about when someone tells \nhis slave, \"You are free as a musib\" or \"sa'iba\", by which he means \nemancipated. This expression is disliked because it was used in \nthe Jahiliyya for livestock as Allah azza wa jall says about them, \n\"Allah did not institute any such thing as bahira or sa’iba\" (Holy \nQur‟an 5:105)  \n \n35.16f Inheritance of wala'  \n \nThe wala' is inherited by the closest agnatic heir of the \ndead person. If he has two sons, they share the wala' \nbetween them. If one of them dies, leaving sons, the wala' \ngoes to his brother rather than his sons. If one of them dies \nleaving one son, and the other dies leaving two sons, the \nwala' is shared between all three.  \n \nAlthough the term \"inheritance\" is used here, properly speaking \nthe wala' is not inherited, but there is inheritance on account of it. \nShaikh al-'Adawi (rahmatullahi alaihi): Wala', like lineage, is only \nestablished by two witnesses.  \n \n \n \nChapter 36: Property Rights \n \n \nPre-emption (shuf'a), gifts, sadaqa, hubus, pledges, the \n'ariyya, deposits, lost items, and misappropriation  \n \n \nThis chapter deals with nine topics.  \n \n36.1 Pre-emption in property (shuf'a)  \n \n36.1a The right of pre-emption  \n \nPre-emption is allowed in something which is jointly \nowned.  \n \nShuf'a is derived from shaf' [even], the opposite of odd, because \nthe pre-emptor [shafî'] adds the share which he takes to his share \nand so his share becomes two shares. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) defined it as the partner taking his share \nfrom his partner by an enforced purchase.  \n \nThen he moves to the relationship of the neighbor. Our position \nthat is he has no pre-emption. What is taken by force can be a \nvoluntary sale. It is an allowance which is allowed to avert harm \nto the partner. Jabir (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) judged that there was pre-emption in all \nundemarcated property. When there were clear boundaries and \nroads were clear, then there was no pre-emption.\" (al-Bukhari & \nothers) There are two rulings based on this hadith: the obligation \nof pre-emption is for the partner rather than the neighbor because \nthe ruling in the hadith is that there is no pre-emption after \ndemarcation, and so a neighbor cannot pre-empt his neighbor. The \nsecond is that the obligation concerns real estate rather than \ngoods.  \n \nHe indicates by mentioning joint ownership. He means that the \nright concerns land and buildings and trees attached to it. Shaikh \nal-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the wisdom in \naffirmation of pre-emption is the removal of harm to the partner \nand it is particular to real estate because harm occurs most \nfrequently in it. They agree that there is no pre-emption in \nanimals, clothes, utensils and all moveables. A precondition for \npre-emption is that it is something in which division is feasible, \nthus excluding things which do not accept it without being \nrendered unsound, like a bath-house.  \n \n36.1b When there is no right to pre-emption  \n \nThere is no pre-emption in what has been divided, nor is \nthere pre-emption in respect of a neighbor, a road, the \ncourtyard of a house whose rooms have been divided, a \nmale palm tree or a well when the palm trees or the land \nhas been divided. There is only pre-emption in land and \nthe buildings and trees on it.  \n \nPre-emption was prescribed either to avoid harm in the division or \nharm to a partner. That does not exist in demarcated property \nwhich is why there is no pre-emption in it. Three of the Imams \nagree that the neighbor has no pre-emption while Imam Abu \nHanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) disagrees and affirms pre-emption \nfor the neighbor, but in his view the partner takes precedence over \nthe neighbor. There is no pre-emption in a private road shared \nbetween partners in a house or a garden. As for public roads, it is \nnot permitted to sell them. As for a yard when the house is \ndivided, there is no pre-emption, but if the estate is not divided \nand then is sold and one of the partners has his share of the estate \nand the road, then there is agreement that there is pre-emption in \nboth the estate and the road.  \n \nThere is no pre-emption in a male palm or a well. If pre-emption \nhad been permitted in that, the partner would take all the male \npalm trees and the buyer would have none because pre-emption in \nthat in which the partners share is only the male palm. If land is \ndivided and the well remains, there is no pre-emption.  \n \nTo sum up, pre-emption applies to jointed owned property and the \nright is canceled in three ways.  \n \nOne is when it is abandoned by explicit words, as 'I give up my \npre-emption.\"  \n \nThe second is what indicates that it is abandoned like seeing the \nbuyer building and planting and still remaining silent. The third \nis indicated next.]  \n \n36.1c When pre-emption lapses  \n \nThere is no pre-emption for someone present after a year \nhas passed. If he was absent he still has his right, even if it \nhas been a long time.  \n \ni.e. present in the land where the sale occurs. If he is present for a \nyear and is silent about seeking pre-emption for two months, that \ncancels his right. The one who was absent and far away still has \nthe right since he was absent before the possibility of pre-emption \narose, whether or not he knew about the sale. There is no \ndefinition of near or far (because circumstances vary).  \n \n36.1d Forcing a decision  \n \nA buyer must guarantee the one with the right of pre-\nemption. A possible pre-emptor may be forced to exercise \nhis right or forgo it.  \n \nThe buyer is responsible for any damage to the property. Shaikh \nal-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that if someone is entitled to \ntake it from the pre-emptor, he takes it without giving him \nanything and the pre-emptor must reimburse the buyer what he \npaid and the buyer returns the price to the seller. [This is when \nthere has been more than one transaction.]  \n \nThe buyer can summon the pre-emptor and demand that he \nabandon his right or pay the price for which he bought it if it has a \nlike or its equivalent if it was something with value [i.e. if was \npaid for in livestock or goods, for instance]. If he does one of the \ntwo, there is no discussion. Otherwise the case is presented to the \njudge. If he asks for delay so that he can choose or bring the price, \nhe is given a delay of three days.  \n \n36.1e Pre-emption cannot be transferred  \n \nPre-emption may not be given away or sold. The right is \ndivided between partners according to their shares.  \n \nIt is not permitted for the pre-emptor to give or sell his right of \npre-emption. That form of that would be that Zayd who can pre-\nempt says to 'Amr, who has no right, \"I have given you my right to \npre-empt with Khalid,\" or \"Buy it from me for such-and-such.\" \nPre-emption is a right granted to a partner for the sake of \nremoving harm from him by entering into a partnership with \nsomeone he does not know.  \n \n36.2 Gifts [hiba], sadaqa, and hubus [waqf]  \n \n36.2a Gifts and sadaqa  \n \nGifts and sadaqa only differ in two things. One is that gifts can be \ntaken back while sadaqa is not taken back. When a father gives \nhis son something, he can take it back from him, but that is not \nthe case if he gives him sadaqa.  \n \nThe second difference is that it is permitted for a gift can revert to \nthe ownership of the giver by a sale, gift, sadaqa or some other \nmethod. That is not the case with sadaqa. It is disliked for it to \nrevert to the ownership of the giver by the means we mentioned \nabout the gift.  \n \nIts status is that it is recommended as indicated by the Book, \nSunnah and consensus. In the Book, Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Allah commands to justice and doing good,\" (Holy Qur‟an 16:90) \nand \"Who, despite their love for it, give away their wealth.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 2:176) In the hadith, \"If anyone gives in sadaqa as much as \na date from honest earnings - and Allah azza wa jall only accepts \nwhat is good - Allah azza wa jall will accept it in His right hand \nand will then increase it in size for the giver, just like one of you \nmight rear a foal, until it is the size of a mountain.\" Shaikh ibn \nRushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) and others related that consensus on \nit.  \nHashiyat al-'Adawi: There are four essential elements [arkan] \nin gifts.  \n1. The giver, who must not be someone legally debarred from \ndealing with financial matters.  \n \n2. A gift given by such a person is not valid  \n \n3. The recipient, who must be someone who can own something.  \n \n4. The gift, which must be something whose ownership can be \ntransferred.  \n \n5.The form of the giving.  \n \n36.2b It is dependent on possession  \n \nA gift, sadaqa or hubus is only complete by actual \npossession of it. If the giver dies before it is collected, then \nit becomes part of inheritance, unless that gift was made \nduring his final illness. Then it is paid out of the disposable \nthird as long as it is for other than an heir.  \n \nIf the giver dies before the gift is taken, it reverts to the estate and \nis inherited and the gift is void. If he makes the gift in his final \nillness, however, it is paid out as a bequest unless it is for a heir \nbecause it is not lawful to make a bequest to an heir and so it is \nvoid. But if the other heirs allow it, it is carried out.  \n \n36.3 Gifts and sadaqa  \n \n36.3a Gifts to close relatives  \n \nA gift to a close relative or poor person is like sadaqa and \ncannot be taken back.  \n \nA close relative is one with whom marriage is not permitted and \nsuch a gift is for the purposes of maintaining ties of kinship. The \nprohibition against taking back gifts or sadaqa to a poor person is \nbecause they were given away for the reward and seeking the face \nof Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n36.3b Gifts to one's son  \n \nWhen someone gives sadaqa to his son, he cannot take it \nback. He may, however, take back something he gave to a \nminor child or adult as long as he has not used it to get \nmarried or given it as a loan and nothing has happened to \nthe gift.  \n \nIf the gift was not for the sake of ties of kinship or his poverty or \nout of the desire for the reward of the Next World, but was for \nhimself. There is no difference between a male or female child, \nrich or poor. Something happening to a gift would be like if he was \ngiven iron and has made it made into a tool.  \n \n36.3c A mother's gifts  \n \nA mother may take back a gift as long as the father is alive. \nWhen the father is dead, she cannot take it back.  \n \nWhether the child is a minor or adult as long as the father is alive, \neven if he was mad at the time of the gift, unless, by the gift, she \nintended to maintain ties of kinship, or the reward of the Next \nWorld or because of his poverty. Then she cannot take it back.] \n \n36.3d. Gifts to orphans  \n \nOne may not take back a gift to an orphan. An orphan is \nsomeone who has lost his father.  \n \nIf he has no father at the time of the gift, she cannot take it back \nbecause he is an orphan and thus it becomes like sadaqa. No \nmatter what the age a person is, if his father is dead, he is called \nan orphan in the case of humans. In the case of animals, lack of \nmother makes an orphan, and in the case of birds, both parents.  \n \n36.3e Retaining possession of the gift  \n \nA father is permitted to retain possession what he gives to \nhis minor son when he does not live in that (if it is a house) \nor wear it if it is garment. He can only do that if the gift is \na specific article. He cannot do that if the son is an adult.  \n \nThis is permitted even until he is bankrupt or dies. If the gift is a \nhouse and he continues to live in it or most of it or to wear a \ngarment he gave him until there is an impediment, the gift is \nnullified. If he lives in a small part and rents most of it out, it is \nnot nullified. This is when the gift is described and specified, like \na particular house. He cannot say, \"I have given you one of the \nhouses.\" The father cannot keep that gift if the child is adult and \nsensible. If the son is a fool, he can keep possession of it.  \n \n36.3f Not taking back sadaqa  \n \nA man should not take back his sadaqa or nor can he \nrecover it except by inheritance. There is no harm in \ndrinking the milk of an animal he gave as sadaqa. He does \nnot buy back anything he gave away as sadaqa.  \n \nHe does not take back sadaqa at all once it is received, either by \nbuying it or any other method, and here is no exception to that \nexcept by inheritance, and then he owns it because he had no part \nin returning it and is not suspect. He can drink the milk of \nsomething like a cow or goat and there is nothing wrong in that \nbecause he has not altered the value of he gift. He does not buy \nback his sadaqa from the person he gave it to nor from anyone \nelse. This prohibition is one of dislike, which is the School.  \n \n36.3g Gifts with expectation of a recompense  \n \nIf someone is given a gift for which the giver expects \nrecompense, he should either repay it with something of \nequal value or return the gift. If he no longer has it, then \nhe must give back its value when he sees that the giver \nwanted recompense for what he gave him.  \n \nThis is when the man gives something of his property to another \nso that he will reward him for it. It is a contract of recompense for \nunknown goods. It is permitted. Shaikh al-Baji (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, \"The gift for a recompense is not an act of nearness, \nbut it is a sort of mutual recompense. The one given either \nrecompenses the value of the gift or returns it if the gift is still \navailable. If it is no longer with him, he repays the price or the gift \nif he thinks that the giver wanted that according to the \ncircumstances.  \n \n36.3h Not giving all one's property to one child  \n \nIt is disliked for someone to give all his property to one of \nhis children. Giving part of his property is allowed. There \nis nothing wrong in giving all his property to the poor for \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \nThis is a dislike of one of avoidance in the well-known position. He \nshould not give most of it to one of them either, but what he does \nis carried out unless his other children rise and forbid him to do \nthat. They can force its return [when they fear that they will have \nto support him]. The basis is the hadith of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) \"Fear Allah and be equitable to your \nchildren.\" A small amount is permitted.  \nHe can give all his property to the poor as long as his children do \nnot forbid it. That is limited to when he is not ill. If he is ill, he can \nonly dispose of a third.  \n \n36.3i If the gift has not been collected  \n \nIf someone who is given something does not take \npossession of it until the donor is ill or bankrupt, he \ncannot then take it. If the recipient dies, his heirs can take \nit if the giver is still in good health.  \n \nAn illness here is one in which it is feared that he may die. As well \nas applying to gifts, this principle also applies to sadaqa and \nhubus.  \n \n36.4 Hubus [waqf]  \n \nA hubus is granting the usufruct of something, either in \nperpetuity or for a specific period after which it then reverts to \nprivate property.  \n \nThe Four Imams allow it but disagree about whether it requires \nthe ruling of a judge or is carried out in the same manner as \nbequests. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), Imam ash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) say \nthat it is sound without these two methods and is binding, Imam \nAbu Hanifa (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it requires one of these \ntwo.  \n \nIt is recommended because it is one of the best things which one \ncan use to draw near to Allah azza wa jall. The basis for its \npermissibility is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \ncreated a hubus as did 'Umar ibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \n'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu), 'Ali (radhi‟Allahu anhu), Talha \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu)  and az-Zubayr (radhi‟Allahu anhu)  and \nother Companions for houses and gardens.  \n \nThere are four basic elements (arkan) in the hubus.  \n \n1.  The founder and his suitability for establish a waqf.  \n \n2.  The verbal form of founding the waqf, or whatever the custom \nfor that is. \n \n3.  The object or place which comprises the waqf. \n \n4. The purpose or beneficiaries of the waqf.  \n \n36.4a A house in hubus  \n \nWhen someone makes a house a hubus, it is used for the \npurpose to which he put it if it taken before he dies.  \n \nThe precondition is that the endower is entitled to dispose of his \nproperty of disposable by being one of the people who can dispose \nof his property and make gifts. He can make a waqf of a house, an \nanimal and goods. [In the case of food, it has to be something \nwhich lasts for a long time, like wheat.] The precondition is that it \nis owned by the person who endows it, in itself or its use, and no \none has a claim connected to it, and it is not something which it is \nnot permitted to sell, like the skin of sacrifices and hunting dogs. \nIt is used for the specific purpose for which it was endowed.  \n[Hashiyya: A waqf in money is questionable. There is a position \nthat it is permitted because it lasts and can be replaced. The other \nposition is that it is not permitted because its use lies in its \nconsumption and a waqf must consist of something which will \ncontinue to exist. Lack of permission here can mean dislike or \nprohibition.]  \n \nIf he designates a house as a waqf but does not specify the reason, \nit is used according to the common usage‟s of the people of that \nland.  \n \nIf its use is specified and taken, it is put to that use. If it is not \ntaken before he dies or becomes bankrupt, the waqf is nullified. If \nit is not specific, like a mosque, it does not require a specific \ntaking possession. When people are allowed to do the prayer, then \nwaqf is valid.  \n \n36.4b Waqf for a minor son  \n \nIf it is a hubus in favor of his minor son, he may hold it for \nhim until he comes of age. He should rent it out for him \nand not live it in himself. If he continues to live in it until \nhe dies, then the hubus is nullified.  \n \nThe end of possession is when the child comes of age provided that \nhe knows that he is sensible. If the father continues to live in it \nuntil he dies or becomes bankrupt, then the waqf is nullified. This \nis when the son is free, not a slave.  \n \n36.4c When the original beneficiaries die out  \n \nIf the beneficiaries of the hubus come to an end, the \nnearest of people to the founder on the day it reverts \nbecomes the beneficiary.  \n \nThis is whether the founder is dead or alive. This is like when the \nfounder has a full brother and a half brother by the father. The \nfull brother dies, leaving a son and then the beneficiaries of the \nwaqf come to an end. It reverts to the half brother rather than the \nson of the full brother. One considers who is the closest on the day \nit reverts, not he day it was founded because it may be that the \nrelative who was distant on the day it was endowed will become \nnear when the waqf reverts.  \n \n36.5 Life Grants ['umra]  \n \n36.5a Granting use for a person's lifetime  \n \nIf someone gives a man the use of a house for his lifetime, \nit reverts to the owner when the person dies. It is the same \nif he gave the use to the children of the person and they die \nout. This is not the case with the hubus.  \n \nIf the owner has died, it reverts to his heirs. The reality of 'umra \nin custom is that people of Shari‟ah define it as the gift of the \nusufruct of a certain property for the lifetime of the donee or for \nhis lifetime and that of his descendants, not the gift of a ruqba \n(which is the property for his lifetime). It does not have to be \nspecific for the life of the donee. If it is limited to the life of the \ndonee, it is also called 'umra. This differs from the hubus which \ndoes not revert to the ownership of the owner when the \nbeneficiaries die. A hubus remains a waqf for the closest relative \nof the beneficiaries. There is a difference because the waqf is \nownership of the property and the 'umra is ownership of the use.  \n \n36.5b Death of donee and granter at the same time  \n \nIf the one who granted the use dies on the same day, the \nproperty goes to his heirs on the day he dies.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that it is possible \nthat it means the day of making the 'umra, and then it is the \nownership of the property rather than the usufruct. It can refer to \nthe death of the giver and then it is ownership of property and \nusufruct.  \n \n36.6 More on hubus  \n \n36.6a Death of a beneficiary  \n \nIf one of the people of the hubus dies, his share goes to the \nrest.  \n \nMale or female or equal in this.  \n \n36.6b Those in need are preferred  \n \nPeople in need of lodging and revenue are preferred for \nthe hubus.  \n \nThis is when the beneficiary is not specified, like saying that it is \nfor the poor. Then the people of need and dependents are preferred \nto others for lodging and revenue according to ijtihad because that \nis the aim of the waqfs. If the beneficiaries are specified, then they \nare all equal, and the poor is not preferred to the wealthy.  \n \nThere is some disagreement in the School about whether the poor \nare preferred or not.  \n \n36.6c Evictions  \n \nIf someone is resident, he should not be evicted for \nsomeone else unless that is a precondition in the hubus \nwhich is carried out.  \n \nEven if the new person does not have a dwelling nor revenue, and \neven if the current tenant has become rich after he started to live \nthere because the important thing is the need at the beginning, \nnot one that is constant. There is no security that it will not come \nback. If other than the most needy came first and lived there and \nthen he is evicted, then they will then be of equal need. So \nwhoever lived there first is more entitled to stay. If, however, it is \na term stipulated in the waqf, it is carried out.  \n \n36.6d A waqf is not sold  \n \nThe hubus is never sold, even if it falls into ruins. If a horse \nwhich is a hubus becomes rabid, it is sold and the price \nused for another one like it or to help in paying for one. \nThere is disagreement about replacing a ruined building \nwith a building not ruined.  \n \nWhen it becomes unusable, even if is not hoped to restore it. It is \nnot permitted to sell its rubble. This is restricted to when the \nfounder has not put a stipulation that it be sold. If he did so, than \nhis stipulations are followed.  \n \n[There is a counter position which states that if leaving it will \nresult in harm and there is no hope of restoring it, then it can be \nsold.]  \n \nThere is an exception mentioned in the Mukhtasar about the \namount which is needed to expand the mosque, i.e. the Jumu'a \nmosque, not any other mosque. Similar to the Jumu'a mosque are \nMuslim graveyards and roads because the use of the mosque, road \nand graveyard is greater than the use of the waqf. It is close to the \naim of the founder. There is disagreement about exchanging for a \nprice.  \n \nIn the case of a horse, rabies is a form of madness which can infect \na horse. If it is sold, then the price is used to buy another horse or \ngiven as sadaqa for jihad.  \n \nThere is disagreement replacing a ruined building. Some of them \ntake this literally as exchanging ruined property for unruined and \ngiving it for the unruined. Others say that the ruined property is \nsold and the price used to purchase what is sound and so what \nwas waqf ceases to be waqf and what was not waqf becomes waqf.   \n \n36.7 Pledges [rahn]  \n \n36.7a Legal status of pledges  \n \nThe use of a pledge is permitted and it is only \naccomplished by possession of the article pledged.  \n \nPledges are permitted at home or on a journey. The journey is \nspecified in the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"If you are on a \njourney and cannot find a writer, something can be left as a \nsecurity\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:282) since that is when it is more common \none cannot find a scribe to provide evidence. The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) pledged his armor when he was in Madina. \nThat indicates its permissibility while one is resident.  \n \nIt would appear from what he says is that a pledge is valid before \nit is actually taken, and that is true, but it is only by actual \npossession that the pledgee has a special right to it rather than \nother creditors. Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat if that is delayed until the bankruptcy or death of the \npledger, it is agreed to be nullified.  \n \n36.7b Witnessing pledges  \n \nTestimony about possession is only useful if the witness \nactually saw possession take place.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that this is when it \nis a distinct item and is handed over so that there is a transfer. \nWhen the pledge is not a distinct item and is not handed over, \ntestimony is useful is they both confirm it [e.g. it might consist of \ncertain palm trees].  \n \n36.7c Responsibility for the pledge  \n \nResponsibility for the pledge is that of the one who takes it \nif it is something which can be hidden. If it is something \nwhich cannot be hidden, he is not liable. The responsibility \nfor the fruit of palm trees in pledge is that of the pledger. \nThe same is true for the revenue of houses.  \n \nThis is when he takes the pledge if it is not lodged with a trustee \nwho takes it from the pledger. He is responsible for something \nwhich can be hidden, like jewelry, unless there is evidence that it \nhas been destroyed, Then he is not liable. He is not liable for \nthings like houses and gardens according to the well-known \nposition. This is the case even if the pledgee were to stipulate that \nhe is not liable for what can be concealed or the pledger were to \nstipulate that the pledgee is responsible for what is not hidden.  \n \n[Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nprecondition is void because it is contrary to what is entailed by \nthe contract. Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the \nprecondition is binding.]  \n \nSomeone who is suspect swears, \"It is lost and I was not negligent \nnor destroy it. I did not misuse and I do not know where it is.\" The \none who is not suspected only swears to lack of neglect in \nparticular because it is not suspected that he has concealed it.  \n \nResponsibility for fruits is that of the pledger, whether the fruits \nexist or not at the time of the pledge and whether they are \npollinated or not, unless the pledgee stipulates that it included. \nThe same applies to revenue of houses. That is the responsibility \nof the pledger in the well-known position unless the pledgee \nstipulates that he has that.  \n \n36.7d Children of a slavegirl in pledge  \n \nIf a slavegirl bears a child while she is acting as a pledge, \nher child is also a pledge. The possessions of a slave do not \ngo into pledge with him unless that is stipulated.  \n \nIf he stipulates that the child is not part of the pledge, that is not \npermitted and the pledge is invalid.  \n \nIn the case of the possessions of a slave, whether they are known \nor unknown.  \n \n36.7e Responsibility for the pledge if destroyed  \n \nIf the pledge is destroyed in the possession of a trustee, it \nis the responsibility of the pledger.  \n \nIf it can be hidden. It is not the liability of the trustee because \nthere is no liability for the trustee.  \n \n36.8 The 'Ariyya [Loan for temporary use]  \n \nThe 'ariyya is assigned for a time. The borrower is \nresponsible for what is can be hidden, but not for what \ncannot be hidden, like a slave or a riding animal, unless he \nmisuses it.  \n \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) defines it as transfer of \nownership \nof \nthe \nusufruct \nof \na \nspecific \nthing \nwithout \ncompensation. It is recommended, and even more so in the case of \nrelatives, neighbors and friends. Its basis in the Book is the words \nof Allah azza wa jall, \"Do good, so that perhaps you may be \nsuccessful\" (Holy Qur‟an 22:75) and in hadith, the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) borrowed some armor from Safwan* and \nhe asked, \"Is it misappropriation, Muhammad?\" He (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Rather it is a guaranteed 'ariyya.\"  \n \nHe explains the question of liability in the 'ariyya. The borrower is \nliable for something which can be hidden unless there is evidence \nof its destruction. Then, in the well-known position, he is not \nliable because liability is based on suspicion which is removed by \nevidence. In the case of things which cannot be hidden, Abdullah \nibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) says that he must take an oath, \nwhether he is suspect or not. If the lender stipulates the \nborrower's liability, that is of no use. It is the same if the borrower \nstipulates to the lender lack of liability in that for which there is \nliability. That is of no use and he is liable according to one of the \npositions of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi). They also say that it is effective and \none acts by the preconditions because the 'ariyya is a known topic, \ni.e. there is no liability in the known.  \n \nThe exception to lack of liability is when the borrower abuses it \nand then he is liable. There are many types of abuse, including \nincreasing the load and increasing the distance. He is also liable \nin another case, which is when it is clear that he is lies as when he \nsays that it was destroyed in a certain place and none of his \ncompanions heard that it was destroyed.]  \n \n[*Safwan ibn Umayya who was still an unbeliever at that time.]  \n \n36.9 Deposits [wadi'a]  \n \nDeposit [wadi'a] comes from wada'a, which is \"to leave\". Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"Your Lord has not abandoned you nor does He \nhate you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 93:3) i.e. not abandoned His custom of \nbeing good in revelation to you. In technical usage it is property \nwhich is entrusted to someone's keeping and which must be \nreturned whenever the owner asks for it without excuse. He is \nbelieved about returning it to the depositor unless there was \nevidence in that and then he is only free by clear proof of that.  \n \n36.9a Statements about the deposit  \n \nIf someone given a deposit says, \"I have returned the \ndeposit to you,\" he is believed unless he received it in the \npresence of witnesses. If he says, \"It has disappeared,\" he is \nbelieved in any case. In the case of an 'ariyya, however, he \nis not believed about its destruction if it is something \nwhich can be concealed.  \n \nIf there were witnesses to his taking it, he is only believed when \nthere are witnesses to its collection as his trust was not enough. \nEvidence must be intended for ensuring security. Witnessing is \nonly considered when he says someone along the lines of \"Bear \nwitness that I have deposited such-and-such with him.\" It appears \nfrom his words, \"He is believed\" that he does not have to take an \noath. They derive from the Mudawwana that he must take an \noath.  \n \nWhen he says that the item is destroyed, he is believed whether \nthere was testimony or not. The one under suspicion rather than \nothers swears an oath in the well-known position. It is said that \nboth the one who is suspect and others swear.  \n \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated that and Shaikh \nat-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said it. He repeats the point about \nthe 'ariyya to differentiate it from the deposit.  \n \n36.9b Abuse of a deposit  \n \nIf someone abuses a deposit, he is liable for it. If it was \ndinars, which he returns to their original bag and then \nthey are lost, there is disagreement about whether he is \nliable for them.  \n \nThere are many things that comprise abuse, including putting it \nwith someone else without an excuse, while on a journey or \nresident. Another is traveling with it without excuse and using it \nso that it is destroyed. He indicates this here.  \n \nIf it is dinars or dirhams which were tied or sealed and he lends \nthem or part of them and then returns the same amount to the \nbag and then they are destroyed, it is said that he is liable because \nhe misused by opening them. It is said that he is not liable. That \nis the position of Shaikh ibn a-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) and \nothers. It is well known. It states in at-Tawdih, \"He owes it and it \nonly believed with an oath.\"  \n \n36.9c Trading with a deposit  \n \nIt is disliked for someone to trade with something \ndeposited with him. If he does so with money, the profit is \nhis. If the deposit was goods and he sells them, the owner \ncan choose between taking the price or the value on the \nday he infringed.  \n \nHe has any profit or any loss because he is responsible. It is \ndisliked to do so, even if it is the deposit is money. Shaikh al-\nAqfashi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. If the goods no longer \nexist, the owner has a choice between taking the price for which \nthey were sold or their value on the day he sold them. If they are \nstill present, he can choose between canceling the sale and taking \nback his goods, or taking the price for which they were sold.  \n \n36.10 Found property  \n \n36.10a Announcing the article which has been found  \n \nIf someone finds something, he must announce it for a year \nin a place where it is hoped that it will be recognized. If, \nafter a year, no one comes forward, he can make it a hubus \nor give it away as sadaqa. If he does that, he is responsible \nfor it if its owner should then come forward.  \n \nIt is mandatory to announce it immediately. If he delays until it is \nlost and then its master comes, he is liable for it. Shaikh at-Tata'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. It is mandatory to describe it since \nthe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) commanded that. In the \nMuwatta' it states that a man came to the Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) and asked him about an item which is found. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Publicize its purse and its strap. Then \npublicize it for a year.\" Publicizing it for a year is applies if the \nitem is large. As for something insignificant to which one pays no \nattention, which is less than the legal dirham, as Shaikh Abu'l-\nHasan \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nthe \ncommentator \nof \nthe \nMudawwana, said, it is not publicized. What is more insignificant \nand less than a lot is publicized for some days if someone might \nlook for it. As for what will go bad by delay, like fruit, it is for the \nfinder and he does not announce it.  \n \nThe announcement is made in a place where that will achieve a \nresult, and it is in the place in which he found it. When he \nannounces it, he does not mention its category, but mentions it in \na general manner, saying, \"Who has lost something?\"  \n \nIf he then gives it away as sadaqa, it is on his behalf or on behalf \nof its owner.  \n \n36.10b Using the article  \n \nIf the finder makes use of it, he is responsible for it. If it is \ndestroyed before or after the year is up without action on \nhis part, he is not responsible.  \n \n He is responsible if it is destroyed. If he does not destroy it, he \nmust pay its rent to its owner if it is like something which is \nrented, like animals. If he did not do anything to abuse it, even \npermitted action, as when it is fodder, he is not liable because it is \na trust with him.  \n \n36.10c Claiming the article  \n \nIf the claimant recognizes the purse and the strap, he may \ntake it.  \n \nIt would appear that both matters must exist. That is not the case, \nbecause one of them is enough because he may have forgotten the \nother. It also appears that knowing the number of dinars and \ndirhams is not a precondition, and that is true according to Shaikh \nAsbagh (rahmatullahi alaihi). Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) and Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) consider that. \nRevenue from the item during the period of publicizing it belongs \nto the finder. [Revenue can be milk, butter, cheese and the like.]  \n \n36.10d Lost animals  \n \nA man may not claim a stray camel in the desert, but he \ncan take a sheep and eat it if it is found in uninhabited \nwasteland.  \n \n[Hashiyyat: This is when the camel is safe from wild animals and \nthieves. Then he can take, although it is also stated that he does \nnot take it in any case.]  \n \nHorses and donkeys are not the same category as lost camels: they \nare part of lost articles. If he finds them, he takes them. An \nuninhabited area is like a desert.  \n \nHe is not liable or eating a sheep in the desert or uninhabited \narea, but if he brings to an inhabited area alive, he must announce \nit because then it becomes like a found article. \n \n36.11 Compensation for consumption of another's property  \n \nIf someone consumes merchandise, then he owes their \nvalue. If the goods are weighed or measured, he owes the \nequivalent.  \n \nThis is the well-known position. Opposite it is what Shaikh al-Baji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) reported from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) that he has a position which states that all damages are \nreplaced with their equivalent, as is stated by Imam Abu Hanifa \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) and Imam Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nAccording to the well-known position, one considers the price and \nthe place of the consumption, whether intentional or accidental. \nIntentional and accidental are the same in respect to people's \nproperty.  \n \nIf it is weighed, measured or counted things which are not \ndifferentiated, like eggs, he owes the equivalent in the place where \nhe consumed it. \n  \n[If the amount is undetermined, he is liable for the value of a heap \nof it.]  \n \n36.12 Misappropriation [ghasb]  \n \nThis is the final topic of this chapter. Ghasb in technical terms is \nto take property by force by encroachment without banditry. Its is \nforbidden because of what has come about in the ayats of the Holy \nQur'an and the hadiths of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). Among the ayats is, \"Allah does not love those who go \nbeyond the limits.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:190) There is the hadith in the \ntwo Sahih collections where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"No one unjustly takes a piece of land measuring a \nhand's width but that Allah azza wa jall will encircle him down to \nseven earth‟s on the Day of Rising.\"  \n \nOne of its rulings is liability as he indicates here.  \n \n36.12a A misappropriater is liable  \n \nA misappropriater is liable for what he misappropriated. If \nhe returns it in its original state, he owes nothing. If it has \nchanged while in his possession then the owner can choose \nbetween taking it with the defect or making him liable for \nits price.  \n \nShaikh \nal-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nsaid, \n\"The \nterm \nmisappropriater applies to every human who is Muslim or a \ndhimmi since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said 'The \nhand owes what takes until it returns it,' i.e. obliged to return it if \nit exists, or its price or equivalent if it is gone.\"  \n \nThe well-known position is that liability takes note of the state of \nthe misappropriation. If it is returned unchanged, he owes \nnothing. He is obliged discipline, repentance and asking \nforgiveness for the wrong action. If it is changed in a negative way \nby something divine, the owner can take it as it is with its defect \nwithout a fine or be paid the price on the day he took it.  \n \n36.12b When he has caused the damage  \n \nIf the loss was due to his misuse, the owner has a choice \nbetween taking it and taking it with compensation for the \ndamage. There is a difference of opinion about that.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Or he is liable for \nthe price on the day he misused it. It is reported from Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) and one position of Shaikh ibn al-\nQasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he can take the price or take it \nimperfect with nothing with it. This is the source of the \ndisagreement.  \n \n36.12c Income from usurped property  \n \nThe misappropriater has no right to the revenue and must \nreturn what he consumed of the revenue or pay for any use \nhe had from what he took. If he has intercourse with a \nslavegirl he takes, then he is subject to the hadd-\npunishment and his child is a slave of her owner.  \n \nIt is clear that it is mandatory to return the revenue absolutely, \nwhether land, animals, slaves or other things, and that is the \nposition of Shaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh ibn \nZiyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi). Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the \nliteral text of the book specifies responsibility for the revenue of \nland rather than slaves and animals, and that is the position of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) in the Mudawwana.  \n \nIf he has intercourse with a slavegirl he has wrongly taken, he is \nsubject to the hadd if fornication is established by evidence or \nconfession because it was unlawful intercourse with no quasi-legal \njustification. The child belongs to the owner because every child, \nfrom fornication or marriage, follows its mother in respect of \nownership.  \n \n36.12d Past revenue  \n \nThe usurper of property has no right to its profit up until \nthe time he returns it to the owner. Some of the people of \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) prefer that he give it \naway as sadaqa. There is something about this in the \nchapter on judgments.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that when he \nmisappropriates some money and trades with it and it increases in \nhis possession and it is connected to his responsibility, the profit is \nhis as the liability is his, but it is disliked since it comes from \nproperty to whose use the owner did not consent. When he returns \nthe capital as it was and is allowed it by the owner, that is \npermitted for him when the owner is agreeable about it. Shaikh \nAshhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) recommended that he give it as \nsadaqa to expiate what he committed of the wrong action of \nmisappropriation based on what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Sadaqa extinguishes errors as water extinguishes \nfire.\"  \n \nThere is something about misappropriation in the next chapter on \njudgments. \n  \n \n \nChapter 37. Judgments on Homicide and \nHadd-Punishments \n \n \n \nThis chapter deals with reprisal (qawd), blood money, retaliation \n(qisas) and related topics, like the ghurra [slave paid in \ncompensation].  \n \n[Hashiyya: Qisas concerns retaliation for limbs and qawd is \nretaliation for loss of life.]  \n \nThis chapter also deals with the crimes which result in the hadd \npunishments, like illicit sex, slander, drinking, and theft. Hadd \nmeans prohibition, and legally is what is imposed to prevent the \ncriminal from reverting to the like of he did and to deter others.  \n \n[Hashiyya: The chapter also deals with its legal consequences, \nlike exile, and its size. Ta'zir (discretionary punishment) is also \ndealt with. The hudud are deterrents to protect loss of sanity, life, \nreligion, honor and property, and lineage. Qisas [retaliation] \nprotects lives. Amputation for theft protects property. The hadd \nfor illicit sex protects lineage. The hadd for drinking protects \nminds. The hadd for slander protects honor. Execution for \napostasy protects religion. It is said that the hudud are \nexpiation‟s, which is sound.]  \n \n \nRETALIATION FOR HOMICIDE  \n \n37.1Conviction for homicide  \n \n37.1a. Necessary evidence  \n \nNo one may be killed for homicide except on the basis of \njust evidence, confession, or by the qasama when that is \nnecessary.  \n \nA life is only taken for another life equal in freedom, Islam and \nprotection when the killing has been proven by one of three \nmatters. The first is evidence, the second confession and the third \nis the qasama oath. There are certain preconditions in the killing \nwhich will be dealt with.  \n \nHashiyya: A consequence of equality is that a free man is not \nkilled for a slave nor a Muslim for a non-Muslim because the \nhigher is not killed for the lower. As for protection, a harbi is not \nentitled to retaliation since he is not safe from being killed. This, \nof course, is as long as the person is not killed for financial gain. \nIn such a case, the higher is killed for the lower. The criminal in \nthis case must be one with legal responsibility [adult, sane], \nintend the blow, and the victim must have protection, either by \nIslam, safe conduct, or jizya. Retaliation is not carried out on a \nchild or mad person or someone who errs nor someone who kills \nsomeone with no protection.  \n \nFor evidence, the minimum is two men. Homicide which obliges \nretaliation is not established by one man and two women. The \nright to blood money, however, is established by that. In al-\nJawahir, it states that the precondition for the validity of the \ntestimony is agreement about the description of the killing. If the \ntwo witnesses differ in their description, as when one says that he \nslaughtered him and the other that he burned or wounded him, \nand the accused denied what they say and the relatives claim \nboth, there is no entitlement to his life. If they swear the qasama \nto one version, the testimony of one is canceled since the accused \nand the relatives agree that it was untrue. Confession is when the \naccused make a voluntary confession without being forced to do so. \n  \nThe qasama can be obliged when the killer in sane, adult and \nequal to the victim in respect of deen and freedom and is not his \nfather, and the relatives agree on killing. The oath is taken by two \nor more. Furthermore, there is suspicion, i.e. circumstances which \nstrengthen the claimant's side and it is probable that he is telling \nthe truth, as when a reputable person sees the victim in his blood \nand the accused to close to him with the trace of killing on him, as \nhe is stained in his blood and the knife in his hand.  \n \n37.1b Form of the qasama  \n \nThe form that the qasama takes is that the relatives [of the \nvictim] swear fifty oaths and then they are entitled to take \nthe life of the accused. If it was premeditated murder, then \nthe minimum required is that two men swear the oaths. \nMore than one man is not put to death as a result of the \nqasama.  \n \nThe relatives, who must be 'asaba [paternal relatives] of the \nvictim, whether they are his heirs or not, swear the oaths. If there \nare fifty of them, they each swear one oath: \"By Allah. There is no \ngod but Him. So-and-so killed him or he died from the blow he \nstruck.\" According to the Muwatta', then they are entitled to the \nlife of the accused. In premeditated murder, not less than two men \nof the 'asaba must swear in case of inadequate evidence, and that \ntakes the place of evidence. As the testimony of one man is not \nenough for evidence, it the same applies here. One is not enough.  \n \n[Hashiyya: If there are no 'asaba by lineage, then the 'asaba by \nclientage swear. The qasama obliges retaliation if it was \ndeliberate and blood money if it was accidental. The oaths are \nsworn one after another and then they are entitled to his life. The \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Will you swear fifty oaths so \nthat you will be entitled to the blood of your companion?\"]  \n \nIf a group are accused of homicide, and there is a qasama, it is \nsaid that the qasama is against one man, and it is said that it is \nagainst the entire group and then they choose one of them to \nexecute.  \n \n[Hashiyya: When a group deliberately kills someone acting \ntogether out of aggression and he dies immediately or is mortally \nwounded, and the actions of each of the group cannot be \ndistinguished and it is unclear which was the mortal injury or all \nthe injuries led to death, then they are all killed without the \nqasama. In other words, the murder is established by evidence or \nconfession. If the qasama is required, then only someone directly \nconnected to the murder is killed when the blow was not \nimmediately. Then only one is killed through the qasama process. \nWhen this happens, the rest are given a hundred lashes and \nimprisoned for a year.]  \n \n37.1c When the qasama is necessitated  \n \nQasama is obliged by the statement of the dying man, \"So-\nand-so killed me\" or there is a witness to the killing, or two \nwitnesses to the wounding if he then survives long enough \nafterwards to eat and drink.  \n \nIn the first case, Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) and all his \npeople do not disagree that it is suspicion of deliberate murder \nwhich obliges the qasama and retaliation. The same applies to a \nsingle eye-witness to the killing, when he is reputable. The \nrelatives swear with his testimony and they are entitled to his life.  \n \n[Hashiyya: This is when the victim who makes the statement is \nadult, free, Muslim and sane. There is disagreement about \naccidental killing. The well-known position is that the relatives \ntake the qasama and are entitled to blood money. It is said that \nthere is no qasama in that because it is a financial claim, and that \nis reported from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \nAs for the witness to the killing, it would appear from the wording \nthat the witness can be reputable or not, and this is reported from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). The well-known position is \nthat that does not constitute suspicion because his testimony is \nomitted legally. Two women are like one man in this. Death also \nhas to established for the process to continue.]  \n \nThere is also the case where two witnesses testify to seeing the \ninjury, meaning the blow, or the blow. That is also considered \nsuspicion when there is testimony of one reputable eye-witness to \nthe injury or the blow, deliberate or accidental, according to the \nstatement of the victim, \"So-and-so wounded me, or hit me.\" Then \nthe relatives take the qasama, swearing that he died of that \nwound or blow. If he dies immediately or is struck a mortal blow, \nhe is killed for him without qasama. \"Eating and drinking\" is not \nmeant literally, but refers to a delay after eye-witness of the \nwounding or blow, for a day or more, even if the victim does not \neat or drink.  \n \n37.1d When the claimants refuse to swear  \n \nIf those who claim blood refuse to swear, then the one \naccused must swear fifty oaths. If he cannot find those \namong his relatives who will swear with him, then the \naccused himself swears fifty oaths. If a group are accused \nof murder, then each of them must swear fifty oaths.  \n \nIf all or some of them refuse to take the oath for the deliberate \nkilling when the qasama is obliged by the statement of the victim \nor a witness to the killing, then the suspect swears with them. If \nthe accused swears fifty oaths, then he is innocent. If he refuses, \nhe is imprisoned until he swears and he is not released from \nprison unless he swears.  \n \n[Hashiyya: This is when the relatives of the deceased are the \nsame degree in lineage or closer than others, as when the son \nrefuses when the uncle is present. Such a refusal is not considered \nif the one who refuses has a more distant degree, as when an \nuncle refuses when the brother is present.]  \n \nIn the case of an accused group, each swears fifty oaths and is only \ninnocent by swearing fifty oaths.  \n \n37.1d Fifty oaths  \n \nWhen the relatives seek blood, fifty men swear fifty oaths. \nIf they are less than that, the oaths are divided between \nthem. A woman does not swear in a case of premeditated \nmurder.  \n \nShaikh al-Aqfahasi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"This is the \nposition of 'Abdu'l-Malik (radhi‟Allahu anhu). It is that it is not \npermitted for only two to swear when there are more present. If \nthere are less than fifty, then the oaths are divided between them. \nIf there are two then each swears 25 oaths.\" If there are more \nthan fifty, then fifty of them satisfy the requirement.  \n \nA woman does not swear in a case of willful killing, whether or not \nthere is a male with her because being male is a precondition to \nthe entitlement to taking blood by the qasama. If there are only \nwomen, then the victim becomes like someone with no heirs and \nthe accused must swear the oaths to clear himself.  \n \n[If the accused then refuses to swear, he is imprisoned until he \ndoes so.]  \n \n37.1e Accidental homicide  \n \nIn the case of an accidental homicide, the heirs, male or \nfemale, swear according to what they inherit of the blood \nmoney. If the division of the oaths is uneven, then the one \nwith the largest share swears the remaining oath.  \n \nIn the case of two, each swear twenty-five oaths. In three, each \nswear 16 and two-thirds oaths, so each mends the shortfall which \ngoes to his portion and so they each swear 17 oaths. If the division \nis uneven and, for instance, there is a son and a daughter, the \nfactor is three and the male swears 33 and a third and the female \n16 and two-thirds, and so the female has the larger fraction and so \nthe daughter swears 16 oaths.  \n \n37.1f Oaths of heirs is a precondition  \n \nWhen some of the heirs are present swear to gain the blood \nmoney on account of accidental killing, they must swear all \nthe oaths. Then those after them later swear according to \ntheir shares of the inheritance.  \n \nThe oaths must total fifty in Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nview. Otherwise they are not entitled to any of the blood money. \nWhen those who were absent at the time of the swearing arrive \nlater, then they swear and the oaths of those present before them \nis not sufficient. Shaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said \nthat that is because part of the precondition of taking this \nproperty is to have the oaths. When the one who is present \nswears, he is entitled to his share of it, and any heir who comes \nlater must swear according to his portion of the oaths and then he \ntakes his share. He does no swear all since the earlier swore all \nthe oaths.  \n \n37.1g Manner of swearing  \n \nThey swear the oaths while standing. People living in the \nprovinces of Makka, Madina or Jerusalem should be \nbrought to those places to perform the qasama. People of \nother provinces are not summoned to their provincial \ncenter unless they are a short distance from it.  \n \nThis description of taking oath applies to the qasama and to oaths \nsworn for financial rights. In the well-known position, it is done \nstanding to deter them lest falsehood refute truth.  \n \n[Hashiyya: There are two views about what happens if they \nrefuse to swear standing. Shaikh ibn al-Majishun (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says that it can be done while sitting. Standing, however, is \nthe well-known position of the School, and refusing to do so \nnullifies the right to blood money.]  \n \nThe apparent meaning of the text is that the time is not made \nhard for them, but the place is.  \n \nThe meaning of provinces is that those who are subject to those \nlocations are summoned to those places for the qasama to make it \nhard for them, even if there is a great distance between them and \nthese places, like ten days, because that will deter the liar because \nof the nobility of the site. That only applies to these three places. \nWhat constitutes a short distance varies in definition. Some say \nthree days and some say ten days.  \n \n37.1h Not swearing for wounds  \n \nThere is no qasama in the case of wounds, nor for slaves, \nor one of the People of the Book, nor if the body is found \nbetween the battle lines or found in the quarter of people.  \n \nThis is when someone wounds someone else and has no evidence. \nThere is no qasama. There is retaliation for deliberate wounding \nand blood money for the accidental, i.e. when there are two \nwitnesses, there is blood money for the accidental and retaliation \nfor the deliberate. If there is only one witness, he swears one oath \nwith the witness and takes the blood money for the accidental \ninjury and retaliation for the deliberate [when there is equality]. If \nthe claimant does not swear, the wounder is free if he swears an \noath. Otherwise he is imprisoned for the deliberate wound and \nindebted for the accidental.  \n \nThere is no qasama for killing a slave because he has a lower rank \nthan the free. When it is established that a person killed him by \ntwo witnesses, he is liable for his price, whether intentional or \naccidental, whatever it is, and he receives a hundred lashes and is \nimprisoned for a year.  \n \nThere is no qasama between People of the Book. This does not \nmean if the killer and victim are both unbelievers. What is meant \nis when a dhimmi is found dying and says, \"I was killed by so-and-\nso,\" who is a Muslim, and two reputable men witness his \nstatement, there is no qasama for him. He owes his blood money \nfrom his own property if it was deliberate and the 'aqila (tribe) \npay if it was accidental. If there is only the claim of a relative of \nthe unbeliever against a Muslim , one pays no attention to it.  \n \nThere is no qasama for someone found between battle lines of \nMuslims when the two groups are following their interpretation \nsince each group believes it is permitted to kill the other since he \ntakes its money, for instance, and one of them dies, his blood has \nno legal consequence.  \n \nThere is no qasama a victim is found in the quarter of a people, \nand the place where the victim was found was one where people \nother than the people who live there pass through it. If other than \nits people do not pass through it and a murder victim is found is \nfrom other than its people. That constitutes inadequate evidence.  \n \n37.2 Pardon  \n \n37.2a No pardon in murder for gain  \n \nThere is no pardon in the case of murder done for financial \ngain.  \n \n When someone kills a person in order to take his property, then it \nis not permitted to pardon him, or there is no pardon which is \neffective, even if the victim was an unbeliever and the killer a free \nMuslim because killing in this way is hiraba [aggravated robbery] \nand when the robber kills, he must be killed, even if it is for a \nslave or an unbeliever. Pardon is not permitted in this because it \nis the right of Allah azza wa jall. According to this, he is killed by \na hadd punishment, not retaliation. \n  \n[Hashiyya: Pardon in this case cannot be issued by the victim, \nrelatives or ruler, even if the victim is an unbeliever, because this \nis a right of Allah azza wa jall and pardon is not permitted in it.]  \n \n37.2b The victim pardoning his killer  \n \nA man may pardon his murderer if he was not killed for \nfinancial gain. He may pardon for accidental killing from \nthe disposable third of his state.  \n \nThis is when he pardons after he has been dealt a mortal blow, \nand then the relatives cannot say anything. If it is accidental, that \nhas to come from the third because of the blood money is part of \nhis property and the heirs can forbid him to dispose of more than a \nthird because his financial dealings are restricted while he is in \nthis condition.  \n \n37.2c Pardon granted by the heirs  \n \nIf one of the sons of the victim pardons, then the killer is \nnot killed, but the other heirs still receive their shares of \nthe blood money. Daughters cannot pardon when there are \nsons.  \n \nThis is once the right to blood has been established and the son is \nan adult. The killer is not killed because blood cannot be divided. \nIf part of it is canceled, it is all canceled. When one of the sons \ncancels killing or forgoes his share, the other sons still are entitled \nto their shares of the blood money. When there are sons, \ndaughters do not pardon, nor do sisters pardon when there are \nbrothers. Pardon and taking in full is a right of the 'asaba [male \npaternal relatives] rather than that of the females equal with \nthem.  \n \n37.2d Punishment of a pardoned murderer  \n \nSomeone who is pardoned for willful killing receives a \nhundred lashes and is imprisoned for a year.  \n \nThis also applies when retaliation cannot be carried out on the \nkiller because of lack of equality, as when a Muslim kills an \nunbeliever. This punishment was carried out by the Salaf, may \nAllah azza wa jall be pleased with all of them.  \n \nII BLOOD MONEY  \n \n37.3 The tariff for blood money (diya)  \n \n37.3a The tariff for accidental homicide  \n \nThe blood money for people with camels is one hundred \ncamels. For those who use gold, it is one thousand dinars, \nand for those who use silver it is twelve thousand dirhams.  \n \nDiya is derived from wadi, which means destruction. Since it is \nobliged by death, it is called that. It is a technical term for the \nindemnity obliged by killing a human being in recompense for his \nblood. What is obliged in killing another can be called his value as \nwhat is obliged on account of killing a slave is his value. Blood \nmoney is obliged by the words of the Allah azza wa jall, \"Anyone \nwho kills a believer by mistake should free a believing slave and \npay blood-money to his family.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:91)  \n \nIn the Muwatta', the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) is \nreported as stating that blood money is \"one hundred camels for a \nlife.\" There is consensus on that. \n  \nIt varies according to the perpetuator. People with camels are \nnomads and tent people. It is one hundred camels taken from five \ncategories. People of gold are like the people of Egypt and Syria, \nand people of silver are like the people of Iraq. His words imply \nthat blood money is only from these three categories, and that is \nthe case in the well-known position. It is not taken from cattle nor \nsheep nor goods. \n  \n[Hashiyya: If, however, both parties agree on something else, it \nsatisfies the requirement. Those who oppose the well-known \nposition and allow cattle and the like, say that it is two hundred \nhead of cattle and one thousand sheep. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said in the Muwatta', \"The generally agreed on way of \ndoing things in our community is that camels are not accepted \nfrom the people of cities for blood-money nor is gold or silver \naccepted from desert people. Silver is not accepted from the people \nof gold and gold is not accepted from the people of silver.\"]  \n \n37.3b The tariff for willful killing  \n \nThe blood money for murder, if accepted, in camels is \ntwenty five four year old she-camels, twenty five five year \nold she-camels, twenty five three year old she camels and \ntwenty five two year old she-camels The blood money for \naccidental homicide is twenty of each type and twenty \nmale three year old camels.  \n \nIf blood money is accepted or retaliation impossible due to the \ndisparity, then the camels consist of these four types: twenty five \nwhich are hiqqa, twenty five which are jadha'a, twenty five which \nare bint labun, and twenty five which are bint makhad. In the \ncase of the accidental killing, there are twenty of each of the four \ncategories, as well as twenty three-year old male camels (ibn \nlabun). The blood money for intentional killing has less categories \nthan the accidental killing, even thought the number is the same.  \nMale camels are less valuable than female ones.  \n \n37.3c When a father kills his son  \n \nThe blood money is made more exacting in the case a \nfather who kills his son by throwing a piece of iron at him \nand killing him. He is not put to death for his death, but he \nmust pay thirty, five year old she-camels, thirty, four year \nold she-camels and forty khalifas, which are pregnant \ncamels. It is said that the 'aqila [the tribe] pay that and it \nis also said that it comes from his own property.  \n \nThis includes anything which he does without the intention to kill \nhim. He is not executed because of the respect for fatherhood. If \ncircumstances indicate the he actually intended to kill him, then \nhe is killed for him in the well-known position.  \n \nImam Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) takes the position of Imam \nAbu \nHanifa \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nImam \nash-Shafi'i \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that the father is not killed for his son \nbecause he was the reason for his existence. Included in this \njudgment are mothers and grandparents. \n  \nThere is disagreement about who pays the blood money. The well-\nknown position is that the killer, father or anyone else, pays it \nimmediately and it is not delayed. If he has property at that time, \nit is taken from him. Otherwise it awaits his wealth. It is said that \nthis heavier blood money is owed by the 'aqila (tribe). Shaikh ibn \nal-'Arabi (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is the tribe which pays \nthe blood money. It is said that it comes out of his own property if \nhe has property. If he does not, then the tribe pays it.  \n \n37.4 The tariff for other than Muslim men  \n \n37.4a Half the tariff  \n \nThe blood money of a woman is half that of a man. The \nsame applies to the blood money of Kitabis, and their \nwomen is half of that of their men.  \n \nThe blood money of a free Muslim woman is half that of a free \nMuslim man. So her blood money is fifty camels, in fourths or \nfifths according to whether the killing is accidental or deliberate. \nThe more severe form [if the victim is a daughter] is 2/3rds of \nsixteen and a third of camels from every type. In money, it is five \nhundred gold dinars and six thousand silver dirhams.  \n \nThe same is true for the Jews and Christians. It is half that of the \nMuslims based on what Shaikh an-Nasa'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nreports that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \nblood wit of the people of the dhimma is half that of the Muslims. \nThere is half of that blood money for Kitabi women.  \n \n37.4b Magians  \n \nA Magian's blood money is eight hundred dirhams and that \nof their women half of that. The same principle applies to \npenalties for wounds.  \n \nA Magian, who is not a Kitabi, has this amount in silver and in \ngold it is sixty-six dinars and in camels, six and two-thirds in \ncamels. Their women have half of that. The same portion applies \nto wounds.  \n \n37.5 Blood money for mutilation  \n \n37.5a Full blood money for hands, feet and eyes  \n \nThere is full blood money for loss of both hands or feet or \neyes, and it is half for the loss of one of them.  \n \nThe full money is for the loss of both. There is half for loss of one. \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"This is for \naccidental wounding. When it is deliberate, retaliation can be \ntaken from the criminal.\"  \n \n37.5b Full blood money  \n \nThere is full blood money due for cutting the cartilage of \nthe nose, causing loss of hearing, causing loss of mental \nunderstanding, breaking the back, crushing the testicles, \ncutting off the penis, and cutting off of the tongue or \ndamaging it so that the victim cannot speak. There is full \nblood money due for destroying the breasts of a woman or \nfor causing the loss of the eye of someone with one eye.  \n \nIf only part of the nose is cut, then it is calculated according to the \ndamage. There is full blood money for causing loss of hearing. If it \nonly one ear, then it is half, even if he only hears by it. When his \nmental faculties are impaired because a blow, there is full blood \nmoney. When his mental faculties is impaired by the amputation \nof his hands, he is owed double blood money. If both testicles and \npenis are cut off, double blood money is owed.  \n \n[The is half blood money for one testicle.]  \n \nIn the case of the tongue, if someone cuts off part of it by which \none speaks and he cannot speak, that entails full blood money \nbecause the tongue is for speech, not touching. There is discretion \n[hukuma] on any other part of the tongue. Hukuma means that \nthe one evaluates the victim like a sound slave. If a sound slave is \nworth ten, for instance, then after the injury is estimated at nine, \nthe difference is a tenth, and so a tenth of the blood money is \ndemanded.  \n \nThere is full blood money for the breasts of a woman, whether the \ncutting is partial or total. There is full blood money for the loss of \nthe single eye of a one-eyed person when that is accidental. If it is \ndeliberate, that will be mentioned.  \n \n37.6 Tariff for lesser wounds  \n \n37.6a. The mudiha and loss of fingers and toes  \n \nFor a mudiha wound, which is a head wound which \nexposes the skull, the penalty is five camels. There is the \nsame amount for loss of a tooth. There are ten camels due \nfor the loss of each finger or toe, and three and a third for \nthe tips of fingers and toes, and five camels for the tips of \nthe thumb or big toe.  \n \nThese amounts are for accidental wounds. There is retaliation for \ndeliberate wounding. In the case of loss of a tooth, that also \napplies if it becomes very disordered [and turns black or is \ndiscolored], and whether it is from the front or the back. In the \ncase of tips of fingers, a finger has three parts, and there is a third \nof each part. Again, this is in the case of accidental injury. There \nis retaliation for the deliberate wounding.  \n \n37.6b Other wounds  \n \nThere is fifteen per cent for a munaqqila wound. The \nmudiha is a head wound which exposes the bone and the \nmunaqqila is one affects the skull, but does not reach the \nbrain. If it reaches the brain it is a ma'muma wound, and \nthere is a third of the blood money for it. The same holds \nfor ja'ifa (abdominal) wound.  \n \nFifteen per cent is 15 camels and intentional and accidental \ninjuries are the same in it and there is no retaliation in such a \nwound since it can prove lethal.  \n \n[Fifteen per cent is one hundred fifty dinars or one thousand eight \nhundred dirhams.]  \n \nThe mudiha exposes the bone and removes the skin and flesh \nwhich covers it. It is only on the head, forehead and cheeks. A \nwound is mudiha if it exposes the amount of a needle of the bone.  \n \nA munaqqila wound is one which chips the bone but which does \nnot reach the brain. Any wound which reaches the brain, even the \namount of a needle, while there still remains a thin membrane on \nthe brain which, if removed, would result in death, is called a \nma'muna. It is only on the head or forehead. There a third of the \nblood money for it, which is 33 1/3 camels, or three hundred \nthirty-three dinars or four thousand dirhams.  \n \nA ja'ifa wound is one which reaches the gut and it is only in the \nback or abdomen. It obliges a third of the blood money.  \n \n37.6c Lesser wounds  \n \nOne exercises ijtihad [discretion] in the case of a wound \nless than a mudiha and in the case of other wounds.  \n \nCases whose amounts are not specified by the Shari‟ah are \ndecided by judicial determination [hukuma]. It is that one \nestimates the decrease in the value of a sound slave after \nreceiving such a wound. For instance, if the slave was worth ten \non the day of the injury and afterwards is worth nine, there is a \ntenth of the blood money owed. It is the same in a wound less than \na ja'ifa wound which is accidental.  \n \nThere is only hukuma.  \n \n37.6d Waiting for the wound to heal  \n \nThe blood money for a wound is only paid after it has \nhealed. If a wound less than a mudiha heals without \nleaving a scar, there is no compensation for it.  \n \nIt is only paid after it heals because it is not known whether full \nmoney is obliged for it or not. Similarly, there is no retaliation \ntaken until after the wound has healed. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. If it leaves no scar and is less than \na mudiha or a ja'ifa, there is no blood money. What is understood \nfrom what he says is that there is something for something which \nheals with a scar, and that is based on the principle of hukuma as \nalready explained.  \n \n37.7 Retaliation (Qisas)  \n \nThere is retaliation for deliberate wounds, unless such a \nwound may prove fatal, such as a ma'muna, ja'ifa, and \nmunaqqila, or breaking a thigh, crushing the testicles, \nbreaking the back, and such injuries. Blood money is paid \nfor such injuries.  \n \nIn the case of wounds which would probably lead to death quickly, \nlike crushing the testicles, breaking the breast bone and breaking \nthe back, blood money is paid for an intentional injury, i.e. blood \nmoney is calculated in it. The blood money is paid in full if the \ninjury demands full blood money, like breaking the breastbone, \nneck or back, or a third or a tenth or a twentieth as was made \nclear.  \n \n[Hashiyya: In the case of deliberate injury, the Qadi must \ndiscipline the perpetrator, whether or not retaliation is taken.]  \n \n37.8 The clan's obligation in the blood money  \n \n37.8a Responsibility for the accidental, not the willful  \n \nThe 'aqila (tribe) do not have to pay for deliberate murder \nnor for homicide based on confession. They can pay for \naccidental injuries if the amount is a third or more of the \nfull blood money. Amounts less than a third are paid by the \nperpetrator from his own property.  \n \nThey do not have to pay the blood money for intentional killing in \nwhich retaliation is canceled by pardon or anything else which \ncancels it. Then it is immediately due from the property of the \nperpetrator. The aqila do not have to pay for the accidental which \nis based on confession, and the perpetrator must pay it himself \nbecause of possible collusion between the killer and the relatives \nof the victim.  \n \nThe 'aqila are called that because they pay ('aqila) the blood \nmoney for him.  \n \n37.8b Major wounds and the 'aqila  \n \nAs for a deliberate ma'muna or ja'ifa wound, Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the blood money paid by the \ntribe ('aqila). He also said that it is said that it is paid from \nhis property unless the perpetrator is without money. \nThen the 'aqila pay it because there is no retaliation in the \ncase of such wounds when they are deliberate. It is the \nsame with penalties which reach a third of the blood \nmoney when there is no retaliation because that might \nprove fatal.  \n \n The first is the well-known position. Retaliation is not taken \nwhen it might result in death.  \n \n37.8c The clan does not pay for a suicide  \n \nThe 'aqila does not pay anything for someone who kills \nhimself either deliberately or accidentally.  \n \nIt is blood with no consequence since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Whoever kills a believer accidentally..\" and \nso the blood money is obliged for the one who kills someone else. \nThat indicates that it is not obliged when someone kills himself.  \n \n \n37.9 Blood money paid to a woman  \n \nA woman is paid the same compensation as the man up to a \nthird of the blood money of a man. If compensation reaches \na third, it reverts to her portion of the blood money (which \nis half).  \n \nUp to a third is taken for things like her limbs as it is for the man \nwith the same amount as that for a man. When the amount is \nmore than a third, the tariff reverts to the blood money of women. \nWhen three of her fingers are severed, she is owed thirty camels \nsince compensation is equal to a man in what is less than a third \nof his blood money. When four of her fingers are cut, she has 20 \ncamels because if they were equal, she would be obliged forty and \nthat is more than a third, and so it reverts to half of what is \nobliged for a man, which is 20. The people of Madina and the \nseven fuqaha' agree on that. \n \n37.10 Cases where the parties are unequal  \n \n37.10a Murder by a group  \n \nWhen a group murder a man, they are all killed for his \nmurder.  \n \nLinguistically a group is from three to ten, but for the fuqaha', it is \nsimply a group. They are all killed if they colluded to kill him.  \n \n[Hashiyya: It makes no difference between they participated in \nthe actual deed or only some did it while the others were present. \nIt is the same if the victim was a woman.] \n  \n37.10b Murder by someone drunk or insane  \n \nIf a drunk kills, he is killed. If a madman kills, his tribe pay \nthe blood money.  \n \nSomeone drunk by drinking what is forbidden, like wine, knowing \nthat it forbidden but deliberately drinks it. That is because he \nvoluntarily becomes drunk and so has no excuse. If he becomes \nintoxicated from medicine, then he has an excuse. This is when he \nkills someone protected who is his equal or higher.  \n \nThe mad person is one who does not recover. The 'aqila pay his \nblood money when it reaches a third. \n  \nIt is the same when he has bouts of insanity and kills someone in \none of those bouts. If he kills someone in a period of sanity and \nthen goes mad, he is executed when he regains his sanity.  \n \n37.10c Minors  \n \nThe deliberate injury inflicted by a minor is the same as an \naccidental one. It is paid by the 'aqila if it is a third of the \nblood money or more. Otherwise it comes from his own \nproperty.  \n \nThere is no retaliation taken from a minor.  \n \n37.10d When the victim is of the opposite sex  \n \nA woman is killed for a man and a man for a woman. \nRetaliation is exacted from each for wounds.  \n \nThere is agreement about a woman being killed for a man. The \nmajority say that a man is killed for a woman since Allah azza wa \njall says, \"We prescribed in it for them: a life for a life,\" (Holy \nQur‟an 5:47) and that abrogates His words, \"free man for free \nman.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:177)  \n \nRetaliation is exacted for wounds since Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Retaliation for wounds.\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:47)  \n \n37.10e Free and slave  \n \nA free man is not killed for a slave, but a slave is killed for \na free man.  \n \nA free Muslim is not killed for a slave. A free non-Muslim is killed \nfor a Muslim slave. If a free Muslim kills a slave, he owes his price \nand the value of any wounds he inflicts. A slave is killed for a free \nMuslim. Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) says, that that is \nwhen the relatives want that because they can choose between \nkilling him or letting him live. If they let him live, the master can \nchoose between handing over the slave or paying the blood money \nof a victim.  \n \n37.19f Non-Muslims and Muslims  \n \nA Muslim is not killed for an unbeliever but an unbeliever \nis killed for a Muslim.  \n \nIt does not matter whether the Muslim is free or a slave, but an \nunbeliever is killed for a free or slave Muslim.  \n \n37.10g No retaliation between unequal’s  \n \nThere is no retaliation between a free man and slave in the \ncause of wounds, nor between a Muslim and an unbeliever.  \n \nThat is because equality is obliged for blood. In short, if the victim \nand perpetrator are equal in freedom and Islam, retaliation can be \ntaken from him for homicide and wounds. If the perpetrator is \nhigher in either category, there is no retaliation in wounds or \nhomicide. If the perpetrator is lower than him, there is retaliation \nin homicide, but not wounds.  \n \nThere is no retaliation between Muslim and unbeliever in wounds. \nIf a Muslim injures an unbeliever, he owes the blood money for \nthat limb if it has a specific blood money. If it is not specified, \nthere is judicial discretion (hukuma). If an unbeliever injures a \nMuslim, he pays the blood money in that for which there is a \nspecific blood money, and there is hukuma in what is less than \nthat.  \n \n37.11 Cases of no legal liability (hadar)  \n \n37.11a Damage done by animals  \n \nSomeone who is driving, leading or riding an animal is \nliable for anything that the animal tramples on. If the \nanimal tramples on something which was not a result of \nwhat the person did, or while it is stopped without \nanything done to it, there is no legal liability for that.  \n \nThe driver drives the animals from behind. They are liable for \nwhat the animal destroys with its feet, but not for what it destroys \nwith its tail or mouth, or if it is standing and is not provoked by a \nblow or goad. There is no penalty for this by the sound \ntransmission that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"There is no blood money for a dumb animal. There is no blood \nmoney for a well and there is no blood money for a mine.\"  \n \n37.11b Wells and mines  \n \nIf someone dies in a well or a mine without any one doing \nsomething to cause that, there is no liability.  \n \nWhen someone falls down a well or mine, like someone who works \nin it and dies. His employer is not charged in it because he has not \ndown anything for which he would be responsible and hence he \nhas no liability.  \n \n37.12 When and by whom blood money is paid  \n \nThe tribe ('aqila) pay the blood money in installments over \nthree years. If it a third of the blood rate is owed, it is paid \nin a year. If it is half, it is paid over two years. Blood \nmoney is inherited according to the shares of inheritance.  \n \nFull blood money is paid for the accidental killing of a Muslim or \nsomeone else. A third of the tariff is due for injuries like that of a \nma'muna and ja'ifa. Half would be due if the victim had lost a \nhand or foot. Full blood money can also be paid be installments \nover four years. [The installments are paid in equal amounts. Less \nthan full blood money can be paid in monthly installments]  \n \nBlood money, whether willful or accidental, is inherited according \nto the shares of inheritance. Each of the heirs takes the portion \nallotted him in the Book of Allah. \n \n37.13 Ghurra penalty for causing a miscarriage  \n \nThere is a ghurra owed for causing the loss of the fetus of a \nfree woman. A ghurra is a slave or slavegirl worth fifty \ndinars or six hundred dirhams. The ghurra is inherited by \nthe heirs according to the Book of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nThat is a twentieth of the blood money of the father or a tenth of \nthat of the mother. The well known position is that only gold \nrather than camels is paid for the ghurra. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that. \n  \n[Hashiyya: This ruling applies to free Muslim or Kitabi woman \nwhen the father is a Muslim, even if the pregnancy is the result of \nillicit sex. It is a pregnancy which would accord umm walad status \nto a slavegirl and can consist of a lump of flesh, a clot or congealed \nblood. The miscarriage is the result of a blow. This is when the \nchild is born dead. If it is born alive, but dies because of the injury, \nfull blood money is due.]  \n \n37.14 Killing a Relative  \n \nSomeone who deliberately kills someone does not inherit \neither his property or his blood money. Someone who kills \na relative by accident inherits his property, but not the \nblood money.  \n \nHe does not veil anyone since the one who does not inherit does \nnot veil an heir. In the case of accidental homicide, he inherits and \nveils. The form of that is that when there are three brothers. One \nof them kills another and the third inherits a third from the blood \nmoney because there is only one brother with the killer because \nthe killer does not inherit from the blood money but does inherit a \nsixth from the property because the killer inherits from the \nbrother and veils the other brother, reducing his share from a \nthird to a sixth.  \n \n37.15 Ghurra in the case causing a slavegirl to miscarry  \n \nThere is the same tariff for causing the loss of a fetus of a \nslave girl pregnant by her master as there is for causing a \nfree woman to miscarry. If she was pregnant by someone \nelse, the fine is a tenth of the value of the mother.  \n \nThis is when the master is free and she miscarries. A ghurra is \ndue in the form of a slave or slavegirl. The umm walad is called a \nslavegirl (ama) here, which is not the technical term. If the parent \nis not the master, then compensation is a tenth for a fetus \nwhatever the sex of the miscarried fetus. \n \n37.16 Killing a slave  \n \nIf someone kills a slave, he owes his value.  \n \nIf a Muslim kills a slave, he owes his price from his own property, \nwhether it is accidental or deliberate unless he kills him for \nfinancial gain. Then he is executed for Allah azza wa jall's right.  \n \n37.17 Collective murder  \n \nIf a group of people kills someone in aggravated robbery \n(hiraba) or for financial gain, they are all killed, even if \nonly one of them did the actual killing.  \n \nWhether they kill a free Muslim, slave or dhimmi. Killing for \nmoney is in order to steal his property and hiraba, according to \nShaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi), consists of every action \nwhich is intended to take property when someone cannot normally \nseek help, whether a man or woman does that.  \n \nAnyone who commit highway robbery or causes alarm on the \nroads is a muharib. The one who commits this must be adult and \nsane. It can be in a city or a town.  \n \nThey are all executed when all of them undertake the killing, even \nif only one of them does it. If one of them decides on that without \nany collusion on their part before, that is different from hiraba \nand gain, and they are not all killed for one unless they conspired \nto kill him or if they all take part in it. \n \n37.18 Atonement for homicide  \n \nAtonement (kaffarah) for accidental killing is mandatory. \nIt consists of freeing a Muslim slave, or, if that is not \npossible, then fasting for two consecutive months. If \nsomeone is pardoned for willful killing, this is best for him.  \n \nShaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is not a \nprecondition that the killer be legally responsible. That is taken \nfrom the property of a child or mad person because that is what is \nprescribed A slave freed to fulfill the kaffarah must be Muslim, \nfree of defects and a full slave. In fasting, the kaffarah is two \nconsecutive months. If he does not fast that consecutively and \nbreaks it deliberately, he must start again. If it is due to \nforgetfulness or illness, he does not start again. This expiation is \nalso recommended for the one who has been pardoned for willful \nkilling because of the gravity of what he did.  \n \nIII CRIMES AGAINST ISLAM  \n \n37.19 Crimes against Islam \n \n37.19a Zandaqa  \n \nA zindiq is killed and his repentance is not accepted. He is \nthe one who conceals disbelief while making an outward \ndisplay of Islam.  \n \nThis is a hadd punishment, not for disbelief, i.e. when he repents \nafter we have exposed him. The legal consequences are that when \nhe is killed for a hadd, his property goes to his heirs. An example \nof his repentance after being exposed is that he denies the \nzandaqa which is proven against him. If he admits it and does not \nrepent, his killing is not a hadd. It is disbelief and so his property \nis that of an apostate and his heirs do not inherit. His property \ngoes to the Muslim treasury. If he repents, it is not accepted. It is \naccepted if he comes in repentance before he is exposed. Such a \nperson was considered a hypocrite in the time of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n37.19b Sorcery  \n \nThe same is true for a sorcerer. His repentance is not \naccepted.  \n \nHe is killed without being asked to repent once he has been \nexposed. If he comes in repentance before he is exposed, then his \nrepentance is accepted.  \n \n37.19c Apostasy  \n \nAn apostate is killed unless he repents. He is given three \ndays to repent. The same ruling applies to a woman. \n  \nSomeone who recants from Islam. Apostasy is disbelief after \naffirming Islam. If he does not repent, he is killed. One does not \nexecute him immediately but repentance is offered to him. If he \nrefuses then he is killed. It is obligatory to delay execution for \nthree days. If he repents, there is no problem. If not, he is killed \nafter sunset on the third day. This judgment includes men and \nwomen. A pregnant woman is deferred until she gives birth. \n  \n[Hashiyya: The School is that he is offered Islam every day \nwithout being punished by beating or pain or made thirsty and \nwithout threats.]  \n \n37.19d Someone who refuses to pray  \n \nIf someone has not apostatized but affirms the prayer and \nyet says, \"I will not pray,\" he is given a respite until the \ntime of the next prayer. If he does not pray, he is killed.  \n \n\"I will not pray now and will pray later\" or \"I will not pray at all.\" \nHe is still in the daruri time in which he can pray one rak'at \nwithout considering being at rest or balance or recitation of the \nFatiha. This is to protect blood as much as possible. If he rises to \npray, there is no problem. Otherwise he is killed with the sword \nimmediately.  \n \n37.19e Refusing to pay zakat  \n \nIf someone refuses to pay zakat, it is taken from him by \nforce.  \n \nEven if it leads to fighting him, and if he dies in that, his blood is \nof no consequence.  \n \n37.19f Refusing to go on hajj  \n \nIf someone does not go on hajj, he is left to Allah azza wa \njall.  \n \nHe is not threatened by death or anything else since he may not \nhave all the preconditions for the hajj, even if that seems so \noutwardly.  \n \n37.19g Not praying out of denial  \n \nSomeone who abandons the prayer out of denial of its \nobligatory is like an apostate. He is asked to repent for \nthree days. If he does not repent, he is killed.  \n \nThe obligatory prayer. Denial means to reject its obligatory \nnature. Such a person is killed for disbelief and not by a hadd. \nThen the funeral prayer is not said for him and he is not buried in \nthe Muslim cemetery and there is no inheritance between him and \nhis heirs and his property goes to the Muslim treasury. \n  \n[Hashiyya: The same applies to the one who denies the obligatory \nnature of zakat.] \n  \n37.19h Insulting the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) \n \nIf someone curses the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) he is \nkilled and his repentance is not accepted. If one of the \npeople of dhimma abuses him (alaihi salat wa salam) outside \nof that which constitutes his disbelief or curses Allah azza \nwa jall other than what constitutes his disbelief, he is \nkilled unless he becomes Muslim.  \n \nWhen he says something to deprecate him. His execution is a hadd \nand hence it is of no use if he repents or denies it when there is \nclear evidence of it. Repentance does not cancel a hadd. This is \nwhy he says that his repentance is not accepted.  \n \nThe same principle applies to someone who curses one of the \nProphets (may Allah azza wa jall bless them all)or one of the \nangels or denies one of the Books of Allah azza wa jall. If someone \nabuses someone whose prophethood is a matter of dispute, like al-\nKhidr \n, he is strongly punished but not killed.  \n \nStatements of dhimmis which constitutes their disbelief would be \nthings like a Jew saying, \"He is not a messenger to us, Our \nMessenger is Musa (alaihi salam).\" Abuse beyond their intrinsic \ndisbelief would be criticizing the character of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). An example of that which constitutes his \ndisbelief is saying that God is three or that He has a son.  \n \n37.19i Estate of an apostate  \n \nThe estate of the apostate goes to the Muslim community.  \n \nIt is placed in the treasury.  \n \n37.20 Aggravated robbery (hiraba)  \n \n37.20a No pardon  \n \nA bandit may not be pardoned when he is caught.  \n \nThis is when he is captured before he repents because that is a \nhadd.  \n \n37.20b His punishment  \n \nIf he has killed anyone, he must be killed. If he has not \nkilled anyone, the ruler should exercise his discretion \naccording to the seriousness of his crime and the length of \ntime he has been a robber. He may execute him, or crucify \nhim and then execute him, or cut off his opposite foot and \nhand, or exile him to another town to be imprisoned there \nuntil he repents.  \n \nWhether his victim was a slave or unbeliever, he is still executed, \neven if the relatives of the victim pardon because it is a right of \nAllah azza wa jall.  \n \nThis also applies to assisting in the killing by striking or holding \nthe victim. This also applies to adult. A child is not killed, but \npunished.  \n \nIf he has not killed, the ruler takes into consideration that which \nhe think will be an adequate deterrent. If is strong, he receives the \nstrongest of the punishments which is the cutting off the alternate \nhand and foot. If he is not strong, it is the easier punishment, \nwhich is exile. The basis of this is the words of the Almighty, \"The \nreprisal against those who wage war on Allah and His Messenger \nand go about the earth corrupting it, is that they should be killed \nor crucified, or have their alternate hands and feet cut off, or be \nbanished from the land.\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:35) Execution is in the \nnormal way with the sword or the spear in the throat. Crucifixion \nis being tied to a post standing, not inverted. Alternate cutting is \nto cut off the left hand and right foot. If he commits robbery after \nthat, he is killed.  \n \n37.20c When a robber repents before he is captured  \n \nIf he is not caught until he comes in repentance, none of \nthese rights, which are Allah's rights, are exacted. The \nrights of people are taken in the form of blood or property.  \n \nNone of the penalties for aggravated robbery are applied because \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"except for those who repent before you \ngain power over them.\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:36)  \n \nAs for the rights of human beings and other rights of Allah azza \nwa jall, like those for illicit sex and drinking wine, these are not \ncanceled at all. So he is liable for the crimes he committed in the \ncourse of his banditry because repentance has no effect on the \nrights of people. They are is taken from his property and he is \nindebted for it if he has no property.  \n \n37.20d Individual responsibility  \n \nEach member of a gang of thieves is liable for all the \nproperty they take. The entire group is executed for the \nmurder of one person in banditry or for financial gain, \neven if only one of them did the actual killing.  \n \nThief here means the robber (muharib), not a simple thief.  \n \nShaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that when a group of \nthieves help one another, they are guilty of aggravated robbery. \nThis is the predominant view. The same applies to rebels and \nusurpers when they form a band.  \n \n37.20e Killing a dhimmi in a robbery  \n \nA Muslim is put to death for killing a dhimmi in \naggravated robbery or for financial gain.  \n \nA robber is killed if he kills a slave in this manner before \nrepenting. If he repents after he has killed, then he owes the blood \nmoney for a dhimmi and the price of the slave and is not killed for \nthem. \n \nIV THE HUDUD  \n \n37.21 Illicit sex [zina] by a someone who is muhsan  \n \nIllicit sex [zina] is the deliberate intercourse of a Muslim who is \nlegally responsibility with a human being with him he or she has \nno legal right [by marriage or ownership]. It is forbidden as \nindicated by the Book, the Sunnah and consensus.  \n \n[Hashiyya: There must be two, and one of them must be a male. \nChildren and the insane are excluded from responsibility for the \naction, and that is not legal zina in respect of them. For legal zina, \nit must be a Muslim. The intercourse of an unbeliever with \nanother unbeliever is not called legal zina and is not subject to the \nhadd. If an unbeliever has illicit sex with a Muslim woman, he \ndoes not receive the hadd, but is severely punished, and she is \nsubject to the hadd. For it to constitute legal zina, it must involve \npenetration of human private parts by the penis. \"Deliberate\" \nintercourse excludes the one who does so in error or in ignorance \nof the prohibition - as when a new Muslim does that not knowing \nthat it is forbidden.  \n \nProof of its illegality in the Book is, \"And do not go near to \nfornication. It is an indecent act, an evil way.\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:32) \nIn the Sunnah, we find that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"One of the greatest wrong actions is that you make \nsomething equal with Allah azza wa jall when He created You. \nThen that you kill your child fearing he will eat with you. Then \nthat you commit adultery with your neighbor‟s wife.\" There is no \ndisagreement in the Community that it is forbidden.\"  \n \nThere are three punishments for it: stoning, flogging, and exile \nafter flogging. He starts with the first.  \n \n37.21a Stoning  \n \nIf someone commits illicit sex and is a free muhsan, he is \nstoned to death.  \n \nThis is a free legally responsible Muslim, male or female. He is \nstoned with medium sized stones, not large ones to avoid \ndisfigurement or small to avoid torture. People should avoid \nhitting the face and private parts and throw them at the back or \nabdomen.  \n \n[Hashiyya: According to the School, no pit is dug for this.]  \n \n37.21b Who is considered to be \"muhsan\"  \n \nOne acquires the status of being muhsan by marrying a \nwoman in a valid marriage and having valid intercourse \nwith her.  \n \nIhsan linguistically means chastity. In the Shari‟ah it is when a \nsane adult male marries a Muslim or Kitabi woman, free or slave, \nwho is adult or not adult but at an age when sexual intercourse is \npossible, in a valid marriage – the invalid marriage does not count \n- and has permitted intercourse with her. If he has intercourse \nwith her while she is having her period, this does not create ihsan.  \n \n37.22 The punishment for illicit intercourse by a non-\nmuhsan  \n \n37.22a The punishment  \n \nIf he is not muhsan, he receives a hundred lashes and \nexiled to another town by the ruler and kept there for a \nyear.  \n \nAnd he is free Muslim and responsible. Exile is the distance about \nthree days. If he returns before the year, he sent back there or to \nanother place of a similar distance.  \n \nThe prisoner pays for the transport there if he has money. \nOtherwise the treasury pays.  \n \n37.22b Slaves and illicit sex  \n \nA slave who commits fornication receives fifty lashes, as \ndoes a slavegirl, even if they are married. They are not \nexiled nor is a woman exiled.  \n \nThe text comes on the slavegirl. Allah azza wa jall says, \"If they \ncommit fornication, they should receive half the punishment of free \nwomen.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:25) Slaves are by analogy with her. It \ndoes not matter that they are married, because freedom is one of \nthe preconditions of being ihsan and so there is a difference.  \n \nA slave is not exiled because that would cause harm to his master. \nA woman is not exiled because she needs to be guarded and \nprotected. Exile would expose her to shame and the occurrence of \nthe like of that for which she was exiled.  \n \n37.23 Conviction for illicit sex [zina]  \n \n37.23a Establishment of guilt  \n \nThe hadd for illicit sex is only carried out when proven by \nconfession, clear pregnancy, or the testimony of four free \nmen who are adult and of good character who see the \nactual act, like a kohl stick entering a bottle.  \n \nIf someone confesses to zina, even once, that obliges the prescribed \nhadd. Clear pregnancy is proof when the woman has neither \nhusband nor master. The third form of establishing guilt is the \ntestimony of four free men who must see the act of penetration in \nillicit sex.  \n \n[Hashiyya: In the case of confession, it must be someone whose \nconfession is valid by his being adult, sane and not compelled.  \n \n37.23b Testimony to this must be identical  \n \nThey must testify at the same time, and if one of them does \nnot give the full description, the other three who gave it in \nfull are given the hadd [for slander].  \n \nThey all testify at the same time, and must agree on what they \nsaw of the penetration. If they meet and one saw it after another, \nthat is not enough because it can be different acts. If one does not \ndescribe it in full, as when he says, \"I saw him between her legs \nbut that is all I saw,\" then the other three receive the hadd for \nslander, but not the fourth. He is punished at the discretion of the \nruler, even if it is worse than the hadd.  \n \n37.24 Minors  \n \nA hadd is not inflicted on someone who has not reached \npuberty.  \n \nHe or she is not yet legally responsible, whether he or she is the \nactive or passive party. The authorities must, however, discipline \nhim in order to rectify his state. \n \n37.25 Illicit sex with a slavegirl  \n \n37.25a A son having intercourse with his father's slavegirl \nor vice versa  \n \nThe hadd is carried out on someone who has illicit sex \nwith his father's slavegirl but not for someone who has sex \nwith his son's slavegirl. He must, however, pay him her \nvalue, even if she does not become pregnant.  \n \nIt is not carried out on the father because of lack of certainty of \nownership, which is not the case for the son. The estimation of her \nprice is made on the day of intercourse and the son cannot have \nintercourse with her after that. After the father pays her price, he \nmust observe istibra' [a waiting period to ascertain if she is \npregnant] if he wishes to continue having intercourse with her \nunless the son has had intercourse with her. Then she becomes \nharam for both, but he still must pay the price to his son because \nhe has destroyed her for him.  \n \n37.25b A partner having intercourse with a jointly owned \nslave  \n \nA partner in a jointly owned slavegirl is punished if he has \nsex with her and is liable for her price if he has money. If \nshe does not conceive, the other partner can choose \nbetween keeping her or being reimbursed for her value.  \n \nThis is true even if the partner gives him permission to have \nintercourse with her because that is not permitted by the simple \npermission of the partner when he is still a partner. He must be \ndisciplined, but less than the hadd since the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) said, \"Avert the hudud on account of doubts.\" He \nowes her price if she becomes pregnant and then the partner \ncannot keep his share in her and continue the partnership because \nof the establishment of the respect for birth, and she becomes his \numm walad. He owes no price for her intercourse because he is \nlike someone having intercourse with his property. If she does not \nbecome pregnant, the partner can choose to keep his share. He \ndoes not pay any fee or bride price nor her depreciation. If the one \nwho did this is wealthy, his partner can take his share from him. \nIf he is not, then he is in debt for the price according to what they \nagree on, immediate or delayed.  \n \n37.26 A raped woman's proof of innocence  \n \nIf a pregnant woman says that she was forced, she is not \nbelieved and receives the hadd unless there is a witness \nthat she was carried off until the abductor disappeared \nwith her or she comes seeking help at the time of the event \nor comes bleeding.  \n \nA free woman with no husband. The is not believed because the \nbasic principle is that sex is normally voluntary and so that is \nassumed to be the case unless compulsion is established and \nbecause believing her is a means to a lot of illicit sex, given \nwomen's inclination to sex, whether she is someone who can be \nforced or not. She must produce evidence of her truthfulness.  \n \nThere are three ways of establishing her truthfulness. The first is \na reputable witness to her abduction.  \n \nIt is said that one witness is adequate because it is a report, and a \nreport is sufficient to bring about a doubt which cancels the hadd.  \n \nThe second is when she calls out for help during the event. The \nthird is when comes in a state which indicates her truthfulness, \neven if she did not cry out in the event. That cancels the hadd.   \n \n\"Bleeding\" refers to a virgin. In the same of a woman who is not a \nvirgin, some physical evidence of violence is required.  \n \n37.27 A Kitabi rapist  \n \nIf a Christian rapes a Muslim woman he is killed.  \n \nOr a Jew. When the rape is proven by four witnesses because this \naction violates their contract. When one of them breaks the \ncontract, he is killed.  \n \nIf he rapes a Kitabi woman married to a Muslim, there are two \npositions about whether he is executed. If he marries a free \nMuslim woman and she does not know that he is a dhimmi, she \nreceives no hadd and there is disagreement about killing him. If \nshe knows that he is a dhimmi but does not know that it is \nforbidden for her to marry a dhimmi, she receives no hadd. He is \nnot killed, but is punished severely. Four witnesses to the actual \nact are required, and the child has the mother's deen, not that of \nthe father. He must pay the bride-price to her.  \n \n37.28 Voiding conviction based on confession  \n \nIf someone retracts a confession to illicit sex, he is released \nand let go.  \n \nWhether it is based on a doubt or not, during the hadd or before it. \nIf he flees during the hadd, that it is like retraction. Flight in the \nhadd indicates retraction by tasting the punishment. A doubt \nwould be like when he says, \"I had intercourse in an invalid \nmarriage and thought that it was illicit sex.\" He can also say that \nhe was lying in his confession. When the hadd is canceled, the \nbride price of the woman is not canceled when she was forced.   \n \n37.29 The one who carries out the hadd punishment on \nslaves  \n \nA master imposes the hadd punishment for illicit sex on \nhis slave or slavegirl is she becomes pregnant or if there is \nother evidence in the form of four witnesses, or confession. \nBut if the slavegirl has a free husband or her husband is \nthe slave of someone else, the hadd punishment is only \ncarried out on her by the ruler.  \n \nHe also carries out the hadd punishments for slander and \ndrinking, but not the hadd for theft. That has several \npreconditions. The status of a slavegirl married to other than a \nslave of the master is different out of the fear that he might \nmisconstrue their being together. Such a case goes to the ruler \nsince the spouse has a right if he is free and his master if he is a \nslave.  \n \n37.30 Homosexual sodomy  \n \nWhen someone commits the action of the people of Nabi \nLut (alaihi salam) with a consenting adult male, they are \nboth stoned, muhsan or not.  \n \nThe words are general, including free and slave and unbeliever. \nThe action of the people of Lut was anal intercourse between \nmales, whether the male is a slave or not. He excludes the female \nfrom this ruling. A person is not stoned for that, but if she is \nsomeone with whom intercourse is lawful for him, he is punished \nseverely. If she is not lawful for him, he receives the hadd for \nillicit sex. A precondition for stoning the passive partner is that he \nis adult. That is also a precondition for the doer. If they are not \nlegally responsible, then there is only discipline.  \n \n37.31 Slander (qadhf)  \n \nQadhf in technical usage is something which indicates illicit sex or \nsodomy or denial of paternity. It is forbidden by the Book, Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"Those who accuse women who are chaste\" (Holy \nQur‟an 24:23) The Sunnah is that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam)  flogged those who delved into the Lie (about 'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu anha)). It has preconditions which concern the \nslanderer and the slandered. He begins with the penalty.  \n \nLinguistically, it means \"to throw stones at\". It is used \nmetaphorically for accusing of disliked things, and it is one of the \nmajor wrong actions.  \n \n37.31a The penalty for slander  \n \nA free person who slanders is given eighty lashes, while a \nslave is given forty lashes for slander and fifty for \nfornication. An unbeliever who slanders also receives \neighty lashes.  \n \nAn adult slanderer, Muslim or unbeliever, even drunk or a father, \nreceives 80 lashes. The slave receives half of that, male or female, \nMuslim or unbeliever. What is required is discrimination. A free \nunbeliever also receives 80 lashes because the ayat is general.  \n \nShaikh ibn 'Arafa (rahmatullahi alaihi) mentioned from the \nMudawwana that there is no hadd applied on the harbi, and \nShaikh ibn Marzuq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that as well.  \n \n37.31b Slander which is not punished  \n \nThere is no hadd for someone who slanders a slave or \nunbeliever. There is a hadd on account of accusing a girl of \nfornication if she is of an age in which she can have \nintercourse, but there is no hadd on account of slandering \na boy, nor is the punishment carried out on a minor for \nslander or intercourse.  \n \nSlander means to accuse someone of illicit sex. A person is not \nflogged for slandering a boy because there is no shame connected \nto him whereas there is for the girl. A child is not punished \nbecause his deeds are not recorded.  \n \nIf he slanders a slave or unbeliever, he is punished, but not with \nthe hadd, according to at-Tahqiq.  \n \n37.31c \nImpugning \nsomeone's \npaternity \nor \naccusing \nsomeone of sodomy  \n \nA hadd for slander is imposed on someone who denies a \nman's parentage or implies that. If someone calls a man a \nsodomite, he also receives the hadd.  \n \nThis is about a free Muslim man or woman. It is the same if those \nslandered are children or mad. It applies if someone attacks a \nperson's lineage, however high. An example of that is saying, \"You \nare not the child of so-and-so.\" He receives the hadd because the \nsuggestion that a man is a bastard is worse than accusing him of \nillicit sex because the shame of illicit sex is removed by repentance \nwhile the shame of being a bastard is never removed. This also \napplies to implication as when he says to a person, \"I am not a \nfornicator,\" meaning that the one he is speaking to is. Expressions \ncan imply their opposite.  \n \nAccusing someone of sodomy also carries the hadd because he \nascribes to him to a foul action whose doer is subject to the hadd.  \n \n37.32 Multiple infractions  \n \n37.32a The penalty for slandering a group  \n \nIf someone slanders a group, then one of the group may \noblige the hadd once, and then the rest have nothing from \nhim.  \n \nThis when it is done in one statement. The hadd in slander is for \nthe sake of removing shame from the slanderer and denying the \nslander. When the slanderer receives the hadd, then the shame is \nremoved and the desired goal of the Shari‟ah achieved and there is \nno need to repeat the hadd.  \n \n37.32b The death penalty takes precedence  \n \nIf someone drinks wine or fornicates more than once, there \nis one hadd for all of that. It is the same with slandering a \ngroup of people. As for someone who has both hudud \npunishments and killing obliged on him, killing him is \nsufficient in that – except in the case of slander. He \nreceives the hadd for that before he is killed.  \n \nThere is one hadd for multiple infractions because the genus is \none, and one hadd satisfies several of the same infraction. The \nsame principle applies to slandering a group of people.  \n \nIf someone is obliged to receive hudud punishment and execution, \nlike someone who fornicates, drinks wine, steals and kills a \nMuslim, the execution satisfies all of that and no hadd is carried \nout on him except for slander. The hadd must be imposed to \nremove the shame from the slandered.  \n \n37.33 Drinking wine  \n \nIf someone drinks wine or intoxicating nabidh, he receives \na hadd of 80 lashes, whether he is intoxicated or not, but \nhe is not imprisoned for that.  \n \nWine includes all that has been fermented from grapes so that it \ncauses intoxication. Nabidh results from soaking dates or raisins \nin water.  \n \nThe punishment is administered to free responsible Muslims out \nof free choice without being compelled, even if the person is \nignorant of the hadd or the prohibition. Khamr is made from \npressed grape juice. It must be swallowed. The hadd is not \nadministered to dhimmis or harbis. The evils resulting from \ndrinking are worse since that can lead to committing other crimes.  \n \nThe punishment is eighty lashes once he is sober again if that is \nestablished by confession of the testimony of two witnesses who \nsaw him use it or smelled it. There is a disagreement about \nwhether there is a hadd for nabidh which does not intoxicate. He \nis not imprisoned even if he does it a lot because it is not reported \nfrom the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) nor from any of the \nCompanions that they imprisoned for that.  \n \n37.34 Administration of the hadd  \n \nThe one who receives a hadd is stripped, but a woman is \nonly divested of what would protect her from the blows. \nThey receive the flogging sitting down. A pregnant woman \nis not flogged until she gives birth, nor is a very sick \nperson until he recovers.  \n \nA male is stripped of everything except what covers the private \nparts. A woman is stripped of things like a fur because the goal is \nrestraint from the like of what was committed, and it is supposed \nthat the pain of the beating will be a deterrent to the wrongdoer. \nIt is recommended that she be put in a basket and some earth \nunder her and moistened with water for the sake of covering.  \n \nIn flogging, it is the back and shoulders which are hit.  \n \nA pregnant woman is not beaten until she gives birth and finds \nsomeone to care for the child, based on the hadith of Ghamidiyya \nwoman who came to the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) while \npregnant and said, \"Purify me.\" He told her, \"Go away until you \ngive birth.\" A very sick person is not flogged until he recovers out \nof fear of causing death.\"  \n \n37.35 Bestiality  \n \nSomeone guilty of bestiality is not killed, but is punished.  \n \nShaikh ibn Najis (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that he is punished \nsince it is possible that one might understand that he has the \nhadd of a virgin. but that is not the case. \"He is punished\" \nindicates that what is meant is that he does not receive any hadd. \nHe is punished as the ruler sees fit since he has done something \nforbidden.  \n \nHashiyya: This is based on the hadith of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) \"Whoever comes to an animal, receives no hadd.\" \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related it. That is the \naction of the people of knowledge and the transmission that he \nand the animal are killed is not established.  \n \n37.36 The hadd for stealing  \n \n37.36a The penalty for theft  \n \nIf someone steals a fourth of a dinar of gold or the \nequivalent of goods worth three dirhams or the weight of \nthree dirhams in silver on the day of the theft, his hand is \ncut off if he stole that from a protected place. His hand is \nnot cut off if he snatches them.  \n \nThis penalty is for men and women, free and slave, Muslim or \nothers. The position of the school is that the value of the object is \ncalculated on the day of the theft, not the day of the judgment. \nThe dirhams are pure silver and one does not any attention to \nwhether they are equivalent to a fourth of a dinar.  \n \nThis is when there are dirhams in circulation in the land where \nthe theft occurred.  \n \nThe basis for this is what is in the Sahih collection where the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The hand of a theft is only \ncut off for a quarter of a dinar or more.\" In the Muwatta' it is \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \nhand of a thief is cut off for a shield worth 3 dirhams.\"  \n \nThe thief must also be adult and sane and not own the stolen \nobject. Also excluded is a mother or father stealing the child's \nproperty. If someone is forced to take part in a theft, his hand is \nnot cut off. This would be like the case of someone who is starving.  \n \nIt must be stolen from a protected place, which is in a place in \nwhich is normally put for safety. That varies according to \nindividuals and property. Some places are secure for one person \nbut not for another, or are secure for some goods rather than \nothers.  \n \nThe hand is not cut off for snatching, which is when he takes \nsomething openly in when someone is inattentive.  \n \n37.36b Multiple cases of the same crime  \n \nIn such a case of theft, the hand applies of a man, woman \nor slave is cut off. If the person steals a second time, his \nleft foot is cut off. If he steals a third time, his left hand is \ncut off. If he steals a fourth time, his right foot is cut off. If \nhe then steals again, he is flogged and imprisoned.  \n \nThe amputation takes place at the wrist and at the ankle. If he is \nimprisoned, it is until he repents or dies.  \n \nThe expense of his imprisonment comes from his own property. If \nhe has no property, then from the Muslim treasury.  \n \n37.37 Voiding a conviction based on admission  \n \nIf someone confesses to theft, his hand is cut off. If he \nretracts, he is let go.  \n \nOne confession is enough for this. If he retracts his confession by a \ndoubt or something as when he says, \"I took my deposited \nproperty,\" and he thought that that was theft. A case of no doubt \nis when he says, \"I lied in my confession.\" \n \n37.38 Return of stolen goods  \n \nA thief must return what he stole if he has it. Otherwise, he \nis indebted for that amount.  \n \nHe pays the value. Otherwise he remains liable for it.  \n \n37.39 Mitigating factors  \n \n37.39a The item stolen must be removed from its place of \nkeeping  \n \nIf someone takes something from the place where it is in \nsafe keeping, his hand is not cut off until he actually \nremoves the stolen object from its place of keeping. The \nsame applies to stealing a shroud from a grave.  \n \nThis is whether he removed it himself or threw it outside or \nremoved it on the back of his animal or a group lift it on the head \nor back of one of them and he takes it out while they remain in the \nsecure place or they go out with him. For all of that there is \namputation. When it has not been taken out of the secure place or \nit is destroyed in it and then removed, there is no amputation. \nThere is no amputation for someone who steals a shroud until he \ntakes it from the grave if it is worth a fourth of a dinar or more.  \n \n37.39b Stealing from a house one is permitted to enter  \n \nIf someone steals from a house he has permission to enter, \nhis hand is not cut off. The hand of someone who snatches \nis not cut off.  \n \nThat is because he is not a thief. He is treacherous. The \ntreacherous one does not have his hand cut off. The basis is what \nShaikh at-Tirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) related: the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Neither a looter, \ntreacherous person or snatcher has their hand cut off.\" A looter is \nthe one who takes property openly with strength and force. The \ntreacherous person and snatcher do not have their hands cut off. \nThis point is repeated.  \n \nHashiyya: If a spouse steals from the other spouse from a place \nhe or she is forbidden to enter, their hand is cut off. If it is from a \nplace he or she is not forbidden to enter, it is not cut off. This is \nnot just a verbal prohibition, but the place has to be locked.  \n \n37.39c A slave's confession  \n \nIf a slave confesses to something which obliges a hadd or \namputation on his body, his confession is binding. In that \nwhich concerns his person, he cannot confess.  \n \nThis is when admits to a crime for which the hadd is amputation, \nlike drinking, slander or illicit sex, i.e. for any matter which \nobliges punishment on his body, that is obliged by his confession, \neven if his master denies it, as is in at-Tata'i because he is not \nsuspected of wanting to cause this to himself.  \n \nIf he admits to what would oblige to his being taken possession of, \nas when he admits to cutting off the hand of a free person, that is \nnot accepted from him because he is suspected of wanting to be \ntransferred.  \n \n37.39d That for which there is no amputation  \n \nThere is no amputation for taking fruit hanging on a tree, \na palm pith, or for taking grazing sheep or goats unless he \nstole them from their pens, nor for taking fruit unless it is \nfrom a barn.  \n \nThe same applies to fruit hanging in gardens. As for fruit hanging \nin houses or rooms, there is amputation for that. When palm piths \nare is on the tree, there is no amputation for them. There is no \nhadd for sheep or goats which are grazing, whether or not there is \na shepherd with them unless they are taken from the pens where \nthey go after grazing. The same principle applies to fruits in the \nbarn wherever it is located.  \n \n37.40 Intercession  \n \n37.40a Once the crime is reported to the ruler, there is no \nintercession  \n \nThere is no intercession once a case of theft or illicit sex \nhas reached the ruler.  \n \nThe same applies to drinking wine. Once the case reaches the \nruler, then it is the right of Allah azza wa jall and the ruler cannot \npardon nor can he be asked to pardon, even if the fornicator or \nthief repents. The lack of permission to pardon is derived from the \nhadiths about Ma'iz and the Ghamidiyya woman.  \n \nMa'iz ibn Malik confessed four times to illicit sex. The Ghamidiyya \nwoman came to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nasked to be purified of the sin of illicit sex. They were both stoned.  \n \n37.40b Slander is an exception to this  \n \nThere is disagreement about that in case of slander.  \n \nImam  Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi)said that it is permitted based \non the fact that the hadd for slander is a right for the slandered. \nAnother time he said that it is not permitted based on its being a \nright of Allah azza wa jall. It is permitted to intercede before it \nreaches the ruler. \n \n37.41 Pick pocketing and stealing public property  \n \n37.41a There is amputation for pick pocketing  \n \nIf someone steals from someone's sleeve, his hand is cut off. \nIf someone steals from the granary or treasury or booty, \nhis hand is cut off.  \n \nPick pocketing applies to stealing from a sleeve, pocket, turban or \nbelt. The thief's hand is cut off because that is protected place. The \ngranary is the place where the ruler puts the food and goods and \nthe treasury is repository for money. Stealing from the booty is \nafter it has been set aside. The hand is cut off for any such theft.  \n \n37.41b A possible exception  \n \nIt is said that that if what he took is three dirhams more \nthan his share of the booty then his hand is cut off.  \n \nThat is when he exceeds his right by that amount.  \n \nThat is the position of Shaikh Abdu'l-Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), \nwhile the first position is that of Shaikh ibn al-Qasim \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n37.42 Prosecution for stolen goods  \n \nWhen a thief has his hand cut off, he is prosecuted for the \nvalue of missing stolen goods if he is solvent. If he has no \nproperty, he is not prosecuted. He is, however, prosecuted \nfor an amount which does not reach the level at which the \nhand is cut off.  \n \nIts value is taken from him. If he still has the stolen property, it is \ntaken from him after his hand is cut off because amputation is not \ncompensation for it. If the thief is insolvent, it satisfies the time \nbetween his theft and amputation and it is canceled for him so \nthat he does receive two punishments. He is prosecuted for petty \ntheft which is below the nisab for amputation.  \n \n \nChapter 38. Judgments and Testimony \n \n \nQada' [plural aqdiya] is used for judgments, finishing, destruction \nperformance, sending, carrying out, going, and determination, \nTechnically, as Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) says, it is \nreporting about a legal ruling in a binding way. It is one of the \nfard kifayas, i.e., there must be a number who undertake it since \nit contains necessary public welfare. It can become an individual \nobligation, as when there is one man who fulfills its preconditions \nand it is feared that rights will be lost for their people if he does \nnot undertake judgment. It can be forbidden, when someone is \nignorant and aiming for this world by it or tyrannical. Judgment \nwith justice is one of the best pious actions and injustice in \njudgments is one of the greatest wrong actions and greatest sins. \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"The degenerates will be firewood for \nHellfire.\" (Holy Qur‟an 72:15) The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"The most arrogant of people to Allah and the most \nhated of people by Allah and the furthest of people from Allah is a \nman whom Allah appoints over anything in the Community of \nMuhammad in anything and is not just to them.\"  \n \nBeing is a qadi is a test for the one who undertakes it. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Whoever is made a qadi has \nbeen slaughtered without a knife.\" It has certain preconditions: \nbeing Muslim, sane, free, male, adult, equitable, intelligent and \ncapable of ijtihad.  \n \nOne of its preconditions is ijtihad. It is not sound to appoint an \nimitator when there is a mujtahid available.  \n \nIt is permitted when there is no mujtahid. He must act according \nto the well-known position in the school of his Imam. Know that \nhe means an absolute mujtahid. A lesser mujtahid is in the \nposition of an imitator. There are two categories: a mujtahid of the \nschool, who can establish the proofs, and a mujtahid in fatwa, who \ncan exercise preference.  \n \nHe begins the topic with the sound hadith.  \n \n38.1 Court procedure  \n \n38.1a The onus is on the claimant  \n \nThe plaintiff must produce testimony and the one who \ndenies it takes an oath.  \n \nOne of the shaikhs said that the claimant is the one who says that \nsomething is true and the defendant is the one who says it is not. \nThe claimant must produce evidence because he is someone who \nseeks to establish something. The oath is taken by the one who \ndenies it because he has the stronger side since he claims the \nbasis and the basis is lack of liability.  \n \n38.1b No oaths unless the case is plausible  \n \nThere is no oath taken unless it is established that they \nhave had dealings or that is suspected. That was the \npractice of the judges of the people of Madina. 'Umar ibn \n'Abdu'l-'Aziz (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"People have new \ncases according to the extent that they have new iniquity.\"  \n \nDealings are established by the admission of the claimant or by \nthe testimony of two just witnesses or one witness and the oath of \nthe claimant. \"Suspicion\" is in respect of the theft and usurper. \n\"Dealings\" is in business and probability of suspicion is in \nunlawful appropriation or use of property.  \n \nHash.: The Mukhtasar says that \"dealings\" are established by a \nwoman's evidence.  \n \nThe people of Madina agreed on the evidence, and it is singled out \nby the hadith where the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"The claimant produces evidence and the oath is for the one who \ndenies it.\" The literal meaning of the hadith is that the oath is \ngenerally directed, but it is specific requirement that there were \ndealings between them. That is because there are modern cases \naccording to what people devise of new forms of iniquity which is \nstressed by what 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid. Cases are decided according to ijtihad in that in which there \nis no text. There is no doubt that 'Umar ibn 'Abdu'l-'Aziz \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) was one of the Imams who are imitated in \nword and deed. This is not contradicted by his words, \"Leave what \nthe moderns innovate\" because that is not based on the Book, \nSunnah or consensus.  \n \n38.1c When the defendant refuses to swear  \n \nIf the defendant refuses to take the oath, judgment is not \ngiven to the claimant until he swears an oath to what he \nclaims to the best of his knowledge.  \n \nWhen he says \"I will not swear\", for instance. The claimant does \nnot receive his claim simply by the refusal of the defendant to \nswear. The claimant must swear to what he knows of the \ndescription of what he claims and its amount. This is for a claim of \nidentification. As for an accusation, as when he suspects a person \nof stealing property, the claimant does not swear, but the \ndefendant must pay when he refuses to swear. The oath is only \ntaken by the claimant in a claim of identification.  \n \n38.1d The form of the oath  \n \nThe oath is \"By Allah, there is no god but Him.\" [Billahi \nalladhi la ilaha illa huwa]  \n \nThis is the oath for all rights. Nothing is added or taken form this \nform. This is general to all people, Muslims and Kitabis. It is said \nthat the Kitabi only says, \"By Allah.\"   \n \nThe later is the apparent position of the Mudawwana.  \n \n38.1e Where the oath is taken  \n \nHe takes the oath standing by the minbar of the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) if it concerns something worth a \nquarter of a dinar or more. Outside of Madina, he takes the \noath in the central mosque at the most esteemed place in \nit. The unbeliever swears \"By Allah\" in a place he respects.  \n \nHe takes the oath standing to make it harsh. If he swears seated, \nthat is not adequate. This is what is relied on it. The oath in \nMadina is taken at the minbar to deter the one who takes the \noath. Other places, it is the Jumu'a mosque, and at the mihrab. If \nhe refuses to swear there, he is considered as refusing to swear.  \n \nThe Kitabi swears in a place he respects. For a Jew, he would \nswear in the synagogue and a Christian in the Church and a \nMagian in his temple.  \n \n38.1f Later evidence  \n \nWhen the claimant finds evidence which he did not know \nbefore after the defendant has taken an oath, judgment \ncan be given in his favor by it. If he knew of it before, it is \nnot accepted. There is also a view that it is accepted. \n  \nWhether the evidence was absent or present, if it is close to the \ntime, like about the length of a week. Shaikh ibn al-Majishun \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that judgment is given in his favor after \nhe swears an oath that he did not know. If he knew about it and it \nwas present, then the evidence is not accepted in the well-known \nposition. Shaikh ibn al-Qassar (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is \naccepted.  \n \nHash: He moves on to discuss testimony which is a fard kifayah. \nIf there is only one person capable to giving testimony, then it is \nan individual obligation. If he then refuses to testify in such a \ncase, he is disobedient and can be dealt with by beating and \nimprisonment. Testimony has different ranks. The first is \ntestimony in the case of illicit sex and sodomy. The second rank is \ndealt with here.  \n \n38.1g One witness and an oath in property cases  \n \nJudgment can be given on the basis of a single witness and \noath in the case of property,  \n \nAnd that which leads to property, as when one of them claims that \nhe has an option to withdraw in a sale and the other that the sale \nwas final. The statement accepted is that of the one who says it \nwas final and the one who claims there is an option must bring a \nwitness and take an oath. It similar to hire, accidental wounds \nand recording.  \n \n38.1h Not for other cases  \n \nbut one witness and an oath is not accepted in the case of \nmarriage, divorce, and hudud punishments,  \n \nThis is the third rank.  \n \nTwo witnesses are required in marriage, divorce and the hudud. It \nstates in al-Mudawwana that if someone claims he has married a \nwoman and she denies it, he cannot take an oath to it, even if he \nproduces a witness. Marriage is only established by two witnesses. \nAn example of that in divorce is when the woman claims that her \nhusband divorced her and she has one witness. She does not swear \nan oath with him and the divorce is not obliged. An example of \nthat in the hudud is that one man states that another man has \nslandered him and produces one witness. He does not swear with \nhim and there is no hadd.  \n \n38.1i Not in homicide or deliberate wounding  \n \nnor is one witness and an oath accepted in deliberate \nwounding or homicide. Homicide is only decided by the \nqasama process. There is another view that wounds can be \ndecided on that basis.  \n \nAs when he claims that someone else has deliberately injured him \nand has only one witness. He does not swear with him. The oath is \noffered to the accused. If he swears, he is free. If he refuses, he is \nimprisoned. If he remains for a long time, he is indebted and \nremoved. This does not mean that one judges in homicide by a \nwitness and an oath along is with the qasama about the life.  \n \nIt is also said that judgment can be made about injuries by one \nwitness and an oath in general, whether deliberate or accidental. \nHe presents this and it is well-known while putting the other first \nwhich is not well-known.  \n \nThe view about accidental wounding being decided by one witness \nand an oath is because it leads to property in the form of the blood \nmoney.  \n \n38.2 Women's testimony  \n \n38.2a Their testimony regarding property  \n \nThe testimony of women is only permitted in respect of \nproperty.  \n \nAnd what is connected to property, like hire.  \n \n38.2b The weight of a woman's testimony  \n \nA hundred women count as two women. Two women count \nas one man. Judgment is given on the basis of that with \none man or an oath in cases where one witness and an oath \nare permitted.  \n \nThat is like one man, since the rule that it is possible with an oath \nwhen in such cases.  \n \n38.2c Cases where women's testimony is accepted  \n \nThe testimony of two women alone is accepted in matters \nwhich men do not observe, such as childbirth, the crying of \na new-born child and the like.  \n \nThis is the fourth rank of testimony. Their testimony is accepted \nin what men do not witness, like birth and the cry of a new-born. \nThe fact that he cries means that he was born alive and then he \ninherits and is inherited from. The like of that are things like \ndefects of the vagina and body. This does not contradict what he \nsaid about the testimony of women only being accepted in property \nbecause that is particular to what we defined of his words.  \n \n38.3 \nRejecting \na \nwitness \nbecause \nof \ncharacter \nor \nrelationship  \n \n38.3a Rejection of testimony  \n \nNeither the testimony of an adversary nor someone who is \nsuspect is not allowed.  \n \nThis is the testimony of an opponent against his opponent. \nSomeone suspect is suspect in his deen because of committing \nsomething not permitted in the Shari‟ah. It is also said that his \ntestimony is suspect.  \n \nHashiyya: This is an opponent for material gain which is not \ninsignificant. It is permitted if it is about something insignificant \nor it is a difference in the deen, as a Muslim testifying against an \nunbeliever. It, however, there is a long-standing feud, it is not \naccepted. As the evidence of an adversary is not accepted, it is not \naccepted against the mother, father or son of his adversary, nor is \nhis son's testimony accepted. Someone's testimony itself being \nsuspect is when he is suspected of bias in his testimony.  \n \n38.3b Acceptable witnesses  \n \nOne only accepts the testimony of reputable witnesses.  \n \nBeing reputable ['adala] is not that a man is investigated for \nobedience so that no act of disobedience sullies it because that is \nimpossible and only the true are capable of it. What is meant is he \nusually is obedient to Allah azza wa jall and avoids wrong actions.  \n \nSomeone who is 'adl is free, Muslim, sane, adult, free of iniquity, \ndebarment due to foolishness, and free of innovation. Innovation \nincludes \nMu'tazilites \nand \nKharijites. \nShaikh \nal-Qarafi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"In our view, 'adala is Allah azza wa \njall's right from the judge. He is only permitted to give judgment \nwith reputable witnesses. Imam ash-Shafi'i (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid, \"Since it is Allah azza wa jall's right, even if the litigants \nagree to accept the testimony of an unbeliever or one with whom \nAllah azza wa jall is angry, the judge is not permitted to give \njudgment on that basis.\" Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that.  \n \n38.3c Those who have been punished for a hadd are not \nacceptable as witnesses  \n \nOne does not accept the testimony of someone who has \nbeen given a hadd punishment nor the testimony of a \nslave, child, or unbeliever. If someone who has received \nthe hadd for illicit sex repents, then his testimony may be \naccepted except in cases involving illicit sex.  \n \nThis is when someone has not repented. If he repents, there is a \ntext on that.  \nA slave's testimony while still a slave is not permitted because \ntestimony is one of the ranks of the Shari‟ah which obliges rights \nagainst another and a slave is not worthy of it. The limitation is \nonly while he is a slave. He can testify once he is free.  \n \nThe testimony of a child is not accepted although it can be \naccepted against another child.  \n \nThe testimony of an unbeliever is not acceptable either against a \nMuslim or an unbeliever. If he was an unbeliever and becomes \nMuslim, his testimony is accepted in what does not refer to the \ntime he was an unbeliever. It is not accepted after his Islam \nbecause he is suspected of removing the imperfection which his \ntestimony rejects because of it is natural human natural to seek to \nremove shame.  \n \nIf someone repents of illicit sex, his testimony is not accepted in \nillicit sex. It is only accepted in other cases than for which he \nreceived a hadd. This is general, even if he became the best person \nafter his repentance.  \n \n38.3d Kinship bars testimony  \n \nIt is not permitted for a son to testify in favor of his \nparents or vice versa, nor a husband to testify in favor of \nhis wife or vice versa. It is permitted for a man of good \ncharacter to testify in favor of his brother.  \n \nThe point is that the branch does not testify to its root nor the root \nto its branch. As for the testimony of the branch for the branch of \nthe root or the reverse, that is permitted as is the testimony of one \nof the parents for one of the sons against another son if there is no \nbias for the one in whose favor the testimony is given. Otherwise \nit is forbidden, as when a parent testifies for his pious son against \nthe impious. A spouse cannot testify for the other spouse while \nthey are married or in a revocable divorce. The same does not \napply once they are divorced.  \n \nThe point about root and branches is that the principle extends \nupwards to grandparents and downwards to grandchildren.  \n \nIt is permitted for a brother in favor of his brother, but only in \ncases of property and injuries which entail property, not that \nwhich would bring his brother honor or rank, like testifying that \nhe married in such a way that would bring him honor or rank.  \n \n38.3e Others whose testimony is inadmissible  \n \nOne does not allow the testimony of a habitual liar, \nsomeone who openly commits a major wrong action, \nsomeone seeking his own self-interest or seeking to avert \nharm from himself, or a guardian in favor of his orphan. A \nguardian may, however testify against his ward.  \n \nHash: A habitual liar lies time and time again. A single lie has no \neffect. This is also unlawful lying. As for permitted lying, as when \nit is done in an effort to make peace between two people with a \nfeud, that does not detract from his character.  \n \nSomeone who openly commits a major wrong action or commits a \nsmall of minor action which involves baseness like stealing a \nmorsel or stinginess about a grain in the measure. As for the \nminor wrong actions which do not indicate baseness, like looking \nat a woman, that does not detract unless that is habitual.  \n \nIt is not permitted for someone to testify for his own benefit, as \nwhen someone testifies for his partner about something regarding \nshared property, as when one of the partners claims money from a \nman and that money which he claims is part of the property of the \npartnership. His partner cannot testify for him because it would \nbring him benefit. Averting harm is like when a man owes a debt \nto another and another man claims a debt and this one testifies \nthat he paid his debt. He is suspected of defending himself in the \nquarrel between him and the other claimant, so he will say, \"I will \ndivide the property of the debtor with you,\" or \"I will have it alone \nand you have no debt.\"  \n \nThe same applies to a guardian because this is part of bringing \nabout self-interest by his testimony. The point is repeated because \nhe can testify against him. The expression in the Mudawwana is \nthat if someone cannot testify in favor someone, is permitted to \ntestify against him. \n \n38.4 Testifying to the character of a witness  \n \n38.4a Such testimonial is not permitted from women  \n \nIt is not permitted for women to testify to the good or bad \ncharacter of a witness.  \n \nNeither about men or women. Their testimonial is not accepted in \neither case.  \n \n38.4b Form of testimonial about character  \n \nDeclaring someone to have good character [tazkiya] is only \naccepted when someone says, \"He is reputable and pleasing \n['adlun rida].\" A single witness to the character or bad \ncharacter of a witness is not accepted.  \n \nJustice is a firm form in the self which is compelled to have \nconstant taqwa. One witness is not accepted outwardly.   \n \nHash: Reputability is in action and pleasing means for testifying. \nIt is said that reputability it between a person and people, and \nbeing pleasing is between him and Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n38.5 Testimony of minors  \n \nThe testimony of minors may be accepted on wounds \nbefore they have dispersed and no adult has been with \nthem.  \n \nThis is about what happens among them. Their testimony is also \naccepted in killing in the famous position as well as in wounds, \nbut only before they separate, out of the fear that they might be \ncoached by an adult.  \n \nHashiyya: There are further preconditions. They must be male, \nfree and Muslim. Two or more of them must testify and they must \nhave the same testimony. The one who gives evidence must not be \na relative of the one in whose favor he testifies nor an enemy of \nthe one he testifies against. They must have discrimination about \nthe action. They must have been in the same group. It is also said \nthat the child must be at least around the age of ten.  \n \n38.6 Sale disputes  \n \nWhen two parties to a contract disagree, the seller is asked \nto swear an oath and then the buyer either accepts that or \nswears an oath and is free of the contract.  \n \nThey may disagree about the price as when the seller says that it \nis a dinar and the buyer half a dinar. First the seller swears. The \nSchool obliges that the seller begins with the oath and takes an \noath denying the claim of the buyer and confirming his claim in \nthe same oath. He says, \"By Allah, I did not sell it for half a dinar, \nI sold it for a dinar.\" Then the buyer can take the goods for what \nthe seller says, or swear to deny the claim of the seller and affirm \nhis claim. He would say in this example, \"By Allah, I did not buy it \nfor a dinar, I bought it for half a dinar.\" Then he is freed of the \nbinding nature of the sale, and he can choose between taking the \ngoods for what the seller swore or swear and be quit of the \ntransaction.  \n \n38.7  Ownership disputes  \n \n38.7a Contention over ownership  \n \nWhen two claimants disagree about something in their \npossession, they swear oath and then the disputed \nproperty is divided between them.  \n \nThis is when each of them claims ownership and neither has any \nevidence nor proof of his truthfulness and no one else contends \nwith them in it, and it is part of which either of them can acquire. \nIt is shared between them because their claims are equal and one \ncannot be preferred over the other. If one of them refuses to take \nan oath, then his right is canceled in favor of the other.  \n \nIf there are three, it is divided between the three.  \n \n38.7b When there are character witnesses  \n \nIf the two produce witnesses, judgment is given in favor of \nthe one with better character. If the two witnesses are \nequal, then the two parties swear an oath and the property \nis divided between them.  \n \nIf each of them has a witness who testifies for him and one of the \ndominates the other in justice, then judgment is given in favor of \nthe more just after he swears that he did not sell that thing nor \ngive it him nor did it remove from his property by any aspect at \nall. If neither witness is preferred, then the two witnesses must be \nthe same in justice and one does not prefer by number unless it \nreaches the level of mutawatir. They swear and the disputed thing \nis divided between them because it is not more fitting to give \njudgment for one of them than the other. \n \n37.8 Retracted testimony  \n \nWhen a witness retracts after judgment, he is liable for any \nlosses in which his testimony resulted if he admits to \nperjury. The people of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsaid that.  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that the apparent \nmeaning of the words demands that all the people of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) differentiated between him admitting that \nhe gave false testimony or not admitting it. In the first, he is liable \nbut not in the second. That is not the case, Shaikh Mutarrif \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand Shaikh Asbagh (rahmatullahi alaihi) said in the Wadiha that \nhe is liable absolutely because the error and deliberate regarding \npeople's property is the same.  \n \n38.9 The statement of an agent  \n \n38.9a His statement is accepted  \n \nWhen someone says, \"I have returned to you what you \nentrusted to me to pay\" or \"to sell\" or \"I paid you its price\" \nor \"I have returned your deposit or your loan,\" then his \nstatement is accepted.  \n \nAs when he entrusts him with an amount to repay a debt he owes \nto someone and the agent does not find him and returns it. If the \none who entrusted him contends with him, then one takes the \nword of the agent since he is a trustee. The same applies in cases \nof a deposit.  \n \nIn all these cases the statement accepted is that of the one \nentrusted. It maybe that the author follows what the shaikhs of \nthe Mudawwana said when he makes a statement on it, his word \nmust be accompanied by an oath and so the statement accepted is \nwhen he swears an oath to it.   \n \n38.9b Proof of delivery  \n \nIf someone says, \"I gave it to so-and-so as you commanded,\" \nand that person denies it, then the one who delivered it \nmust produce proof. Otherwise he is liable.  \n \nHe must have evidence that he gave it to him, otherwise he is \nliable for it.  \n \nHashiyya: This is when the custom is to produce witnesses or he \nwas commanded to have witnesses. Then not having witnesses is \nnegligence on his part. If the custom is not to have witnesses, then \nhe is not liable, as this is a case of acting according to custom \n('urf).  \n \n38.10 The statement of a guardian [wali]  \n \nThe same is true in the case of an orphan's guardian. He \nneeds proof about what he spent on them or gave to them. \nIf, however, they are in his direct custody, then he is \nbelieved about their maintenance when it seems probable.  \n \nThis is when the orphans dispute with him about spending and \nclaim that he has not spent on them or they contest the amount he \nhas spent when they were not in his custody as when he spent on \nthem is feasible or well-known, if they are in his care. That is \nbecause of the difficulty of having witnesses in the later case and \nso the onus is lightened.  \n \n38.11 Amicable settlements [sulh]  \n \nAn amicable settlement is permitted unless it leads to the \nunlawful. It is permitted in both affirmation or denial.  \n \nUnless it involves something forbidden in the Shari‟ah, like paying \ngold for silver on a delay. It is permitted in affirming a sale, as \nwhen it is goods or animals and is settled for dirhams, or denial \nwhen he claims a house and the defendant denies it, but satisfies \nhim with something. It is permitted in contracts.  \n \nHashiyya: Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) and Shaikh at-\nTirmidhi (rahmatullahi alaihi) report that the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Reconciliation between the Muslims \nis permitted except for a reconciliation which makes the lawful \nunlawful or the unlawful lawful.\" An example of the first is when \nabout a house which is claimed for wine or pigs, and the second is \nexchanging goods for a garment provided that one who takes it \ndoes not wear it or sell it.\"  \n \n38.12 A slavegirl who marries claiming she is free  \n \nIf a deceitful slavegirl marries a man on the basis that she \nis free, her master can reclaim her and claim the value of \nany child on the day of the judgment.  \n \nShe deceives him by her actual words or by giving the appearance \nthat she is free to the one who wants to marry her. The husband \nowes the minimum of what is named and the bride price of a \nwoman like her. The price of the child is paid by the father since \nthe child is not one whom the master has to free. If the master has \nto free him, there is no liability for the deluded husband to pay the \nprice of his child, as when she deludes the son of his grandparent \nand he marries her thinking she is free and then he learns that \nshe is a slave. The child is freed by his grandfather or \ngrandmother.  \n \n38.13 Establishing a claim to a slavegirl  \n \n38.13a The right of the legal owner  \n \nWhen someone establishes his claim to a slavegirl who has \nborne (her new master) a child, he is entitled to her value \nand the value of her child on the day of judgment.  \n \nThe case is when she has borne a child to a free person who did \nnot acquire her illegally, whether by ownership, gift, inheritance, \npurchase or whatever manner of ownership. The real owner is \nentitled to the price of the slavegirl and the price of the child on \nthe day of judgment and the child is free and his lineage \nestablished.   \n \n38.13b Other views  \n \nIt is also said that he takes her and the price of the child, \nand it is also said that he only takes her price, unless he \nchooses to take the price. If he choose to take her price, he \ntakes from the abductor who sold her.  \n \nHe takes her value on the day he had intercourse with her. All \nthree statements are made by Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). \nHe takes the price from the abductor when he chooses the price as \nis confirmed by the sale of the usurper.  \n \n38.13c If the usurper still has her  \n \nIf she is still in the possession of the abductor, then he \nreceives the hadd and the child and its mother are slaves \nof her true owner.  \n \nIf, after birth, the slavegirl to whom someone is legally entitled is \nstill in the unlawful possession of the one who abducted and he \nknows she is not lawfully his, then he receives the hadd because \nhe had illicit sex.  \n \nThe child is a slave since it is without father. It would have been \nbetter to say that the child is ascribed to the lineage of the mother \nbecause it is connected to her and not him.  \n \nThe ruling regarding someone who purchased her from the \nabductor, knowing about his abduction, is the same as that of \nabductor: his lineage is severed when there is evidence that he \nknew before intercourse that she was unlawfully abducted.  \n \n38.14 Establishing a claim to land  \n \n38.14a If land has been build on  \n \nIf someone establishes his claim to land after it is has been \nbuilt on, he should pay the price of the buildings which are \nstanding. If he refuses to do that, the buyer should pay him \nthe price of the undeveloped land.  \n \nIn the case of someone entitled to take land from someone who has \nbought it or someone else who has not unlawfully acquired it after \nthere are buildings, planting and the like on it, he can pay for the \nimprovements and take the land with its structures or the buyer \ncan pay him the value of the empty land.  \n \n38.14b When the owner refuses either course  \n \nIf the buyer refuses, then they become partners in the \nproperty according to the value of which of them owns.  \n \nHash: One version has, \"either of them refuses.\"  \n \nOr when either of them refuses to pay the other. They become \npartners according to the value of each of them. If the land is \nworth ten dinars and the buildings worth twenty, then one owns \ntwo-thirds and the other one-third. One assesses the value on the \nday of the judgment, according to the famous position, not the day \nof construction of the buildings.  \n \n38.14c The case of the usurper  \n \nA usurper, however, is ordered to remove his buildings, \ncrops and trees. If he wishes, their owner can be paid the \nprice of the debris and trees, after deducting the cost of \nhiring someone to remove that. He owes nothing for what \nhas no value after it is uprooted or demolished.  \n \nIt is not permitted for the two of them to agree to have that \nremain in the land in exchange for rent because that would lead to \nselling crops before they are ripe in exchange for letting them \nremain because the owner would be able to take it free of charge \nin the first division or by the value uprooted in this second \ndivision after it is sold to him.  \n \nHash: If the time for planting that land has passed, the owner \ndoes not command him to remove the crop, but he is paid rental \nfor that year.  \n \nThen the trees can be taken as firewood. He is allowed to gives the \nowner the price of its debris and crops. The like of that is that its \nprice uprooted is 10 dirhams and the wage for removing it is four \ndirhams. He can pay him six dirhams. He is not liable for things \nlike engravings, or plants or trees before they are of any use.  \n \n38.15 Increment in usurped goods  \n \n38.15a Any increment must be returned  \n \nSomeone who unlawfully acquired it must return any \nrevenue, but no one except someone who has acquired it \nunlawfully is obliged to return it.  \n \nThis includes the thief, treacherous person, pickpockets and the \nlike and all of those about whose unlawful possession is clear \nwithout any uncertainty. That is also based on the words of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam), \"The property of a Muslim \nperson is only lawful when he is happy about it.\" The non-usurper \nis one with a doubt, even if he bought it from an usurper when he \ndid not know.  \n \nSince the child is not part of the revenue and he fears that it \nmight be included, he continues:  \n \n38.15b Offspring  \n \nIn the case of the offspring of animals and slavegirls, if \nthey have children by other than the (new) master, they \nare taken by the one entitled to the mothers from the \nperson who purchased them or has gained possession of \nthem for some other reason. If someone unlawfully abducts \na slavegirl and has intercourse with her, the child is a \nslave and he receives the hadd punishment.  \n \nOther means would be like someone who was given her as a gift or \nsadaqa because the ruling of the child is that of the mother since \nshe is property of the one to whom she belongs and so the owner \ntakes him. The usurper does not owe the bride-price, but a fine for \nthe lowering of her value due to intercourse.  \n \n38.16 Building Regulations  \n \n38.16a Responsibility of the owner of the ground floor  \n \nThe owner of the ground floor is responsible for \nmaintenance of ground floor as well as for the wood of the \nceiling and the support for the rooms above it when the \nground floor becomes weak and dilapidated until it is \nsound. He is compelled to make the repairs or to sell it to \nsomeone who will repair it.  \n \nThis is when someone owns the rooms above him. If the ground \nfloor becomes weak, it is feared that the house will collapse. The \nowner of the ground floor must make the repairs since he is able \nto do that. He is responsible for the wood of the ceiling and the \nsupports. Since the solidity of the house depends on the occupant \nof the ground floor, he must either repair it or be made to. If it is \nsold to someone else and he refuses to repair it, then must either \nrepair it or sell it to someone who will put it right.  \n \n38.16b Alterations not allowed  \n \n\"There is no harm nor exceeding harm done.\" He must not \ndo anything which will harm his neighbor: like opening a \nwindow facing him by which he can see his neighbor, \nopening a door directly in front of his door, or digging \nanything that will harm his neighbor, even in his own \nproperty.  \n \nThis is a sound hadith. There is no harming the one who does not \nharm you. That is the meaning of \"no harm\". There is no doing to \nhim more than he does you and so exceeding his harm. As for the \nlike of his action or less than it, that is permitted as Allah azza wa \njall says, \"So if anyone oversteps the limits against you, overstep \nagainst him the same as he did to you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:194) This is \nin relation to the common people. As for the great people and the \nelite, they meet evil with correctness.  \n \nIf there already is a window onto the house of the neighbor, he \ndoes not have to block it, but he is forbidden to look at his \nneighbor from it so that the male can be distinguished from male. \nHe does not open a door opposite his neighbor because that would \nentail looking at the private parts of his neighbors. He does not \ndig something which will harm him, even if it is in his own \nproperty, like digging a well next to his wall or his lavatory.  \n \n38.16c Judgment on a wall  \n \nJudgment on the ownership of a wall is given in favor the \none whose house has wooden or masonry joints in the wall.  \n \nQumut means the wood or palm fiber joints put in the middle of a \nwall to keep it from breaking and the masonry joints are stones \nwhich support the structure. The terms are interchangeable.  \n \n38.17 Water Supplies  \n \n38.17a Excess water  \n \nExcess water may not be denied in an effort to prevent \npeople from grazing animals.  \n \nThe form of that is that there is pasture next to water where some \npeople camp, desiring to graze in it and the owners of the water \nprevent them from getting water so that they will leave their \npasture.  \n \n38.17b Use of wells  \n \nPeople with wells for their livestock have the first claim on \nwater for their animals and then the rights of other people \nare the same.  \n \nThe animals of the people who own the wells water their animals \nand then the animals of the travelers can be watered. People are \nequal in the right to the water afterwards.  \n \nWhen the well are not on private land, and there is a conflict \nbetween those who dug the wells and travelers.  \n \n38.17c Springs or wells on private land  \n \nIf someone has a spring or well on his land, he may prevent \nothers from using it unless his neighbor’s well has caved in \nand he has plants he fears he will lose. Then he cannot \ndeny him his excess water. There is disagreement about \nwhether he can take payment for that or not.  \n \nOr if the well dries up. In this case he is obliged to let his neighbor \nuse it with three preconditions. The neighbor has crops which \ndepend on water, his well has collapsed and he fears the crops will \nbe lost and he has begun to repair his well without delay. There is \ndisagreement about whether he can take payment for that. It is \nrelated from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he does, and \nit is stated in the Mudawanna that he does not. The reason is that \nit is an obligation to give the excess of water by way of help, so he \nshould not take payment for it. The reason for the first opinion is \nthat he uses the property of someone else to revive his own \nproperty.  \n \nHash: The relied on position is that he does not take payment.  \n \n38.18 Another building regulation  \n \nSomeone should not refuse to allow his neighbor to insert \nbeams into his wall but he cannot be compelled to accept \nthat.  \n \nThe meaning is that it is recommended. It is confirmed that the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"No neighbor should \nprevent his neighbor from inserting a piece of wood in his wall.\" It \nis recommended which is why he says that he cannot be \ncompelled. That indicates the refutation of the position of Shaikh \nibn \nKinana \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \nand \nImam \nash-Shafi'i  \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) that he can be compelled.  \n \nHash: The prohibition is one of dislike.  \n \n38.19 Damage done by animals  \n \nIf livestock ruin crops and gardens during night, the \nowners of the animals are liable for that. They do not owe \nanything for damage done during the day.  \n \nThe details of this are in the Muwatta' and elsewhere. It is related \nfrom the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) that the owners of a \ngarden must guard it in the day, but what animals damage in it at \nnight is the liability of the animals' owners. The place of the \nliability for what the animals destroy at night being that of their \nowner is when there is no shepherd with them. Otherwise it is the \nshepherd who is responsible.  \n \nHash: This is when he lets them loose at night and does not die \nthem up. If he ties them up, he is not liable. It refers to animals \nwhich are normally tended, and not creatures like bees and doves \nfor which they are not liable. When he is liable for damage, he \npays the value or replaces what has been destroyed. \n \n38.20 Bankruptcy claims  \n \nIf someone finds his goods in the possession of someone \nwho has become bankrupt, he can either take his share \n[with the other creditors] or recover his actual property if \nhe can identify the individual item. If, however, the debtor \nhas died, he must take his share with the rest of the \ncreditors.  \n \nIf he finds his goods which he sold to a man which are not lost and \nfor which he has not been paid before the buyer goes bankrupt, \nthen he has this choice. He either shares with the other creditors \nin the property as a whole and takes his share or, if it is \nsomething like an animal or a slave, he can recover it. If it is \nsomething like wheat, he can only take a share. If the bankrupt \nperson has died, and he has not received the price before the buyer \ndies, he is not more entitled to his goods than the other creditors. \nHe must take a share.  \n \n38.21 Guarantee of debts  \n \nThe one who gives a guarantee is liable, and the one who \nguarantees the appearance of the debtor is liable if he does \nnot bring the person unless he stipulated that he would not \nbe liable.  \n \nWhen he is unable to fully satisfy the creditor. If someone who \nguarantees an appearance fails to bring the debtor present at the \ntime he is required to bring him, if is liable for the amount the \ndebtor owes unless he stipulated that that was not binding for him \nto be responsible for the money if the debtor failed to appeared. \nAbdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) stated that if he is able to \nbring him and neglects it, then he is liable.  \n \n38.22 Transfer of Debts [Hawala]  \n \n38.22a A transfer is not revocable  \n \nIf someone agrees to have his debt transferred to a third \nparty, he cannot go back to the first debtor, even if the \nthird party becomes bankrupt, unless the first one \ndeceived him.  \n \nIf he deceives him, that means that he knew that the person to \nwhom it was transferred was insolvent and still transferred it to \nhim. If that is the case, the original debtor is not freed of \nresponsibility and the debt reverts to the first debtor.  \n \n38.22b The transfer  \n \nThe transfer is based on an original debt. Otherwise it is a \nguarantee.  \n \nIf it is not on the basis of a debt, then he is a guarantor, i.e. \nresponsible, because a transfer is transferring the responsibility \nfor a right to the responsibility of another. If there is no basic debt, \nthere is no transfer, even if the term \"transfer\" is used. The point \nof that is that the creditor can go back to the original debtor who \nis not free is liability by that because the guarantee does not \neliminate the responsibility of the one guaranteed. It is another \nliability. If it had been an actual transfer, he would be free of \nresponsibility and the one who transferred it would not be able to \nreturn to him.  \n \n \n38.23 More on the guarantee of debts and bankruptcy  \n \n38.23a When a guarantor must pay the debt  \n \nA guarantor is not liable except in the bankruptcy or the \nabsence of the debtor.  \n \nThis refers to his words that the guarantor is liable. The situation \nin which he is liable is the absence of the debtor when the creditor \nhas not ready money with which he can pay the debt. If he is \nabsent, but not far away, he is considered as present. Then he is \nnot liable.  \n \n38.23b In case of death or bankruptcy  \n \nThe death of the subject or his bankruptcy makes every \ndebt he owes immediately due, but not debts which other \npeople owe to him.  \n \nWhat is meant bankruptcy is when a judge orders the stripping of \nhis property, not just the position of creditors. That which is \ndeferred is not immediately due. As for deferred debts becoming \ndue by death, that is because the debt is attached to blood, and it \nis ended by death and the creditor no longer has a connection to \nliability. Therefore what was deferred becomes due immediately \nand the liability moves to the legacy because it is not connected to \nother than the two. When one is gone, only the other remains.  \n \nAs for its becoming due by bankruptcy, it is because the creditors \nmade their agreement based on full responsibility, and that is \ndestroyed by bankruptcy and so that no longer remains.  \n \nThe debts that others owe him do not become due by his death or \nbankruptcy, because their place, which is the responsibility, still \nexists.  \n \n38.23c A slave with debts is not sold to settle them  \n \nA slave permitted to trade is not sold in order to discharge \nhis debts nor is his master prosecuted for them.  \n \nThe master is only prosecuted if he tells them, \"Employ him\" and \nthey do so.  \n \n38.23d Detaining a debtor whose financial situation is \nunclear  \n \nA debtor may be imprisoned until he is cleared. He is not \nimprisoned if he is known to be insolvent.  \n \nHe is imprisoned until his state is known. When his insolvency is \nconfirmed by the testimony of two just witnesses who testify that \nthey do not know that he has money either public or hidden. Then \nhe is not released until he takes an oath that he has no wealth \neither outward or hidden and his oath is absolute and he does \nobtain property, he will pay his debt, even if he any beyond his \nimmediate needs.  \n \nHash: Someone who is well off and refuses to pay his debts is \nimprisoned and flogged time after time until he pays what he \nowes. That is at the discretion of the judge. \n \nA man is imprisoned with other men and a woman is lodged in the \nprotective custody of a trustworthy woman.  \n \n38.24 Apportionment of jointly owned property  \n \n38.24a Division of property  \n \nBuildings and property which can be divided without \nharm are divided [in case of dispute].  \n \nSuch property includes animals, goods and measured and weighed \nthings. This is when there is a dispute and some of the owners \nwant to divide it and some do not. The one who refuses to do that \nis compelled to do it.  \n \n38.24b Enforced sale  \n \nIn the case of something which cannot be divided without \nharm, if one party wishes to sell it, the other partner can \nbe compelled to sell it.  \n \nThis is something like a single slave. If the object would be \ndestroyed by division or would be harmed by it, like a pair of \nleather socks, when division would destroy its use. If the partners \ncontend about any of that and are not happy about using it jointly, \nand one wants to sell it while the others refuse to do that, they are \ncompelled to sell it because it is not possible to divide it to end the \ndispute. Therefore it must be sold in order to end the dispute.  \n \n38.24c Division by lots  \n \nDivision by lots is only done with the same category of \nthing. None of the partners can be given a price [while the \nother takes the goods]. If they decide to equalize the \nshares, the division is only permitted when they both \nconsent to it.  \n \nIt is not permitted to draw lots when the items consist of two \ncategories and or disparate types, like apples and peaches. Each \ncategory is put on its own so that there no clear uncertainty in the \nlots. There is no paying a price since that would result in the \nexistence of two different categories and lots can only be used in \nthe same category.  \n \nHash: Shaikh ibn al-Hajib (rahmatullahi alaihi) adds that the \nproperty on which lots are drawn is shared property. Each \ncategory is divided on its own. You cannot have one lot consist of \nhouses and the other a garden, for instance. Doing that would \ninvolve uncertainty [gharar].  \n \nAn example of equalization is when there are two garments. One \nis worth two dinars and the other worth one. Lots are drawn for \nthem, and the one who gets the garment worth two dinars gives \nthe other five dirhams to equalize them. That is only permitted \nwith mutual consent as when one says the other, \"You have a \nchoice: either you choose that whose value is two dinars and give \nfive dirhams or you take that whose price in one dinar and take \nfive dirhams.\"  \n \n38.25 Function of an executor [wasi]  \n \n38.25a Appointing an guardian-executor  \n \nA guardian appointed by the original guardian is like the \nguardian. A guardian can trade with the property of \norphans and arrange the marriage of their slavegirls. If an \nuntrustworthy guardian is appointed, he may be removed.  \n \nIf the basis is appointment by the father, not by the Qadi. If he is \nappointed by the qadi, then he cannot appoint someone else. He \ncannot buy his property himself. If he does that, the ruler should \nexamine the sale. If he sees in good in it, he allows it, Otherwise, \nhe cancels it.  \n \nHash: The executor must be Muslim, adult, sane, legally \nresponsible and reputable.  \n \n38.25b The sequence is which the estate is dealt with  \n \nOne begins with the cost of the shroud, then paying debts, \nthen paying bequests and then inheritance.  \n \nAfter specific requirements like the umm walad and woman whose \nemancipation is stipulated at a certain term and the like. Then \ncomes the cost of the shroud and then debts which are firm by \nevidence or admission when he was healthy or ill, but that is when \nthere is no suspicion. Then the bequests are paid and finally the \ninheritance is distributed.  \n \n38.26 Squatter's Rights  \n \nIf someone lives in a house belonging to someone else for \nten years, it then becomes his if the owner was present and \nthen did not claim anything from him. Living in the house \nof a relative or in-law this for this period of time does not \nestablish this for him.  \n \nOr it can be land which is more general. The owner being present \nmeans present and sane, and not a relative or a partner. The \nowner must know about his occupation and his ownership. If he \ndoes not know and says, \"I did not know it was my property while \nthis person had it and I only just found the documentation with \nso-and-so,\" or he is an heir and claims that he did not know that it \nwas his property, his word is accepted.  \n \nHashiyya: Hiyaza, which includes the claim to the right of \npossession. Such claims do not extend to animals and goods.  \n \nThis is when he does not claim anything and nothing prevents \nhim from claiming. If the squatter has a force and he stays, even a \nlong time, the claim is heard. After that time his evidence is not \nheard because custom denies it since he was silent about the claim \nfor this entire time outside of the right of Allah azza wa jall. If it is \nAllah azza wa jall's right, it is not lost by occupation, even for a \nlong time, as when someone occupies the road of the Muslims or a \npart of it or a mosque or a place which is a waqf for someone else.  \n \n38.27 Bequests  \n \n38.26a Debt owed to an heir  \n \nIt is not permitted for a sick person to admit to a debt \nowed to an heir or to state that the heir has paid him a \ndebt he owes him.  \n \nThis is in an illness from which it is feared that he might die. He \ncannot affirm the debt which he owes by simple admission or say \nthat he has been paid a debt as when he says, \"So-and-so is owed \nsuch-and-such\", and the form of its admission of taking it is that \nhe says, \"I took the debt which I am owed.\" This is because there \nis the suspicion that if his heirs consist of his daughter and \nnephew, there is basis for his daughter and so one judges by \nsuspicion and his affirmation of taking it is only because of his \nlove for her.  \n \n38.26b A bequest to perform hajj  \n \nIf someone leaves an instruction in his will that the hajj be \nperformed (on his behalf), his instruction is carried out, \nbut we prefer a bequest of sadaqa.  \n \nThis is paid out of the disposable third. The Malikis prefer sadaqa \nto a bequest for hajj because there is no disagreement about the \ndeceased benefiting from sadaqa whereas there is disagreement \nbetween scholars about whether the deceased benefits from the \nhajj. The position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) is that it is \nof no benefit for him.  \n \n38.26b Someone employed to perform hajj  \n \nIf the one hired to make hajj dies before completing it, he \nreceives the fee for the amount he traveled and the rest is \nreturned. What he spent is his liability, unless he took it on \nthe basis that he would be paid on completing it. Then the \nliability is that of those who hired him. If anything is left it \nis returned.  \n \nThis is when he dies on the way to Makka or before completing \nthe practices of hajj. He is paid according to the distance he \ntraveled in respect of difficulty or ease and fear, not simple \ndistance. So a quarter of the distance may be equal to half the \nwage. The rest is returned because he is only entitled to the wage \nby completing the task. He is liable for as spent because it is \nrecompense for the task.  \n \nIn the second case the liability is that of the hirers since they were \nnegligent in not stipulating liability which is more careful. The \nform is that he is given money to make hajj and it is his if he \ncompletes it, and he has nothing if he does not.  \n \n \n \nChapter 39: Shares of Inheritance \n \n \nFara’id is the plural of farida, meaning \"duty\". Part of its \nexcellence is indicated by the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) \"Learn the shares and teach them to people. \nKnowledge will be taken away and sedition‟s appear until two \npeople disagree about the share and do not find anyone who can \ndecide between them.\" [Shaikh al-Bayhaqi (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nand others]  \n \n39.1 List of heirs  \n \n39.1a Male heirs  \n \nThere are only ten male heirs: the son, the son's son, to the \nfurthest generation, the father, the paternal grandfather, \nto the furthest generation, the brother, the son of the \nbrother, to the furthest generation, the paternal uncle, and \nthe son of the paternal uncle, to the furthest generation, \nthe husband and the male client.  \n \nBrothers includes full brothers and half brothers by the father \n(consanguine). The same is true of paternal uncles. The client is \none who has been freed by a person.  \n \n39.1b Female heirs  \n \nThere are only seven female heirs: daughter, daughter of \nthe son, mother, grandmother, sister, wife and female \nclient.  \n \nThis is the full sister or the consanguine sister.  \n \n39.2 Husband  \n \nIf the wife has no children or grandchildren, the husband \ninherits half. If she has children or grandchildren by him \nor by another husband, he gets a fourth.  \n \nIf she has children by another marriage or by illicit sex or li'an, by \na free man or slave, Muslim or unbeliever. This is taken from the \nBook of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \n39.3 Wife  \n \nIf the husband has no children or grandchildren, the wife \ninherits a fourth. If he has children or grandchildren by \nher or by another wife, she gets an eighth.  \n \nThis is taken from the Book of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nHashiyya: In the case of spouses inheriting from one another, they \nmust both be Muslim, free, and not the killer of the spouse, and \nthe marriage must be sound.  \n \n39.4 Mother  \n \n39.4a The basic rule  \n \nA mother inherits a third from her son if he leaves neither \nchild or grandchild or two or more brothers except in two \ncases.  \n \nWhen there is any sort of sibling, full or half, provided they are \nfree Muslims and not the killers.  \n \n39.4b The first exception  \n \nThe first is when he leaves a wife and both parents. Then \nthe wife gets a fourth and the mother a third of what \nremains and then the rest goes to the father.  \n \nWhat remains is two shares. If the grandfather is in place of the \nfather, she takes an actual third of the estate because she inherits \nthe share with him and if it is the father, it is by virtue of \nagnation [males who are residual heirs].  \n \n39.4c The second exception  \n \nThe second is when a woman leaves a husband and both \nparents. The husband gets a half and the mother a third of \nwhat remains and the rest is taken by the father.  \n \nShe receives a sixth. The husband has three sixths, the mother \none sixth, and the two remaining sixths go to the father.  \n \nThese two cases are called Gharawayn because the mother is \n\"duped\" [gharrat] in them, and takes a third in expression, not \nmeaning because in the first she has a fourth and in other a sixth.  \n \n39.4d 'Awl [Accommodation]  \n \nIn other cases, the mother receives a third unless her share \nis decreased by 'awl [accommodation].  \n \nIn other than these two cases, she receives a full third. \nAccommodation occurs when there are more shares than the \nestate. That is when the number of shares is multiplied, as \ntwenty-four shares is like two-thirds and two-sixths. The share is \nnot denied by it, and it is not possible to cancel some of the shares \nwithout an excluder, and none of those with a share is singled out \nfor decrease. Then the number of shares are increased so that the \nloss is divided out between all the people of shares after the people \nowed debts. That is called 'awl and the originator was ibn Abbas \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and the Companions agreed with him.  \n \nThat arose when a woman died in the khalifate of 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) leaving a husband and two sisters. The \nCompanions met and he said to them, \"Allah has allotted half to \nthe husband and two-thirds to the sisters. If I begin with the \nhusband, the sisters will not have their right. If I begin with the \nsisters, the husband will not have his right.\" Al-'Abbas ibn 'Abdu'l-\nMuttalib (radhi‟Allahu anhu) suggested 'awl. He (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) said, \"I think that when a man dies and leaves six dirhams, \nand a man is due three and another four that the property is \ndivided into sevenths.\" The Companions adopted his (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) position.  \n \n39.4e When the mother gets a sixth  \n \nIf the deceased leaves a child or grandchild through by a \nson or two or more brothers, of whatever sort, then the \nmother has a sixth.  \n \nHe mentions the exclusion off the mother from a third to a sixth \nby two brothers. That is the school of all the Imams except ibn \nAbbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu) He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said that she is \nonly excluded by three brothers, seeing evidence in the words of \nAllah azza wa jall, \"If you have brothers or sisters your mother gets \na sixth\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:11) The disagreement derives from the \nminimum of the plural.  \n \n39.5 Father  \n \n39.5a When the father is the sole heir  \n \nIf the father is the only heir, he inherits the entire the \nestate of his child.  \n \nWhether it is a son or a daughter.  \n \n39.5b When there are other heirs  \n \nIf the decreased has a son or grandson by the son, the \nfather takes a sixth. If the deceased has neither child or \ngrandson by the son, the father has a sixth and all the \nothers entitled to shares are given their shares and then he \ntakes the rest.  \n \nOther heirs are the daughter, daughter of the son, or two of more \nof them. If there is anything left, he takes it by virtue of agnation \nsince it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"Give shares to their people, What is left is for the most \nentitled male.\" That exists in the father.  \n \n39.6 Son  \n \n39.6a When the son is sole heir  \n \nAn only son inherits the entire estate, or he takes what is \nleft after the shares of those entitled to a share, like a wife, \nparents, or grandfather or grandmother.  \n \nHe inherits it all when there is no one else entitled to a share. \nWhen he has one or more brothers, they inherit all the property \nand it is shared between them. One begins with the people of \nshares because they are the basis in respect of the asaba because \nthey have specific shares in the Book and Sunnah. If he only has a \nwife, the question is one of eighths. She has an eighth and he has \nthe rest. If he has only two parents, it is in sixths. The parents \nhave two-thirds and he has the rest. If there is a grandmother or \ngrandfather, it is also sixths and the grandfather or grandmother \nhas a sixth and he has the rest. If he has a mother and two \nparents, it is 24ths and the wife has the 3 of her eighth and the \nparents the 8 of their third and the rest is his.  \n \n39.6b A son's son  \n \nA son's son is in the position of the son when there is no \nson.  \n \nThis is the case if there is no direct son, but he is not like the son \nin all aspects because the son is never dropped whereas the son of \nthe son is dropped if there are two parents, two daughters and the \nson's son. He also does not exclude those the son excludes. He also \nis not the same in respect of agnation. The son is an agnate in \nrelation to the daughters but the son's son is not.  \n \n39.6c A son and a daughter  \n \nIf there are a son and a daughter, the male receives twice \nthe share of the female. It is the same whether there are \nseveral or few sons and daughters. They inherit at this \nratio either the entire estate or what is left after people \ntake their shares.  \n \nThis ratio applies is either case. For instance, there are five sons \nand five daughters. They divide the property into fifteen shares \nand it is distributed in that manner.  \n \n39.6d If there is no son  \n \nThe son of a son is like the son in his absence in respect of \ninheritance and exclusion of other heirs.  \n \nThis is repeated.  \n \n39.7 Daughters  \n \nAn only daughter inherits half the estate. Two daughters \ninherit two-thirds of it. If there are more, they do not \nreceive more than two-thirds.  \n \nHer inheritance is based on the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"If she \nis one on her own she gets a half.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:11) The case of \ntwo or more is also based on what the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) did.  \n \n39.8 Son's daughters  \n \n39.8a Their ruling  \n \nThe daughter of a son is like a daughter when there is no \ndaughter. Similarly, the son's daughters are like daughters \nwhen the deceased himself has no daughters.  \n \nSo the consensus is that she inherits half, and if there are two or \nmore they inherit two-thirds.  \n \n39.8b A daughter and a son's daughter  \n \nIf there is a daughter and the daughter of a son, the \ndaughter gets one half and the daughter of the son gets a \nsixth to complete the two-thirds. If the son has several \ndaughters, they do not get more than the sixth if they have \nno brother with them. The remainder goes to the agnates.  \n \nHer receiving a sixth is based on the judgment of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam). The case when there is a brother present \nwill be discussed later.  \n \n39.8c If there are two daughters  \n \nIf there are two daughters, then the daughters of the son \nget nothing unless they have a brother. In that case the \nremainder of the estate is divided between them, the male \ngetting twice the share of the female.  \n \nThey get none of the sixth because the two-thirds is already \ncomplete without them. If nothing remains, they get nothing \nbecause they inherit by agnation and the agnate only inherits \nwhat is left over.  \n \n39.8d A male below the son's daughters  \n \nWhen there is a male in the generation below them, the \nestate is also shared between him and them.  \n \nOn the basis of agnation.  \n \n39.8e A son's daughters  \n \nIt is the same if the daughters of the son inherit a sixth \nwith the daughter, and in the generation below them there \nare daughters of a son or a generation below them which \ncontains a male: the residual estate is shared between him \nand his sisters or paternal aunts in the same way. The \ndaughters of the son who take a share in the two-thirds \nhave no share in the residual estate.  \n \nThis causes agnation and so a male receives the portion of two \nfemales. Ibn 'Umar said that the son of the son causes agnation in \nhis generation and above, but not below.  \n \n39.9 Full and consanguine sisters  \n \n39.9a. The share of the full sister  \n \nA full sister inherits half. Two or more sisters share in two-\nthirds.  \n \nSince Allah azza wa jall says, \"If a man dies childless but has a \nsister she gets half of what he leaves.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:175) The \ntwo-thirds is because Allah azza wa jall says, \"If there are two \nsisters they get two-thirds of what he leaves.\"  \n \n39.9b Brothers and sisters  \n \nIf there are several full or consanguine brothers and \nsisters, then the entire property is divided between them, \nwith the male receiving the share of two females, whether \nthey are many or few.  \n \nBecause Allah azza wa jall says, \"If there are brothers and sisters \nthe males receive the share of two females.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:175)  \n \n39.9c Sisters' share when there are daughters  \n \nIf there are daughters, then the sisters become like the \n'asaba (agnates) inheriting what is left over, but they are \nnot enriched at the daughters' expense.  \n \nThey receive no specific share. They take what is left on the basis \nof agnation, in taking the residual estate, but they are not like the \nagnates in taking all the estate.  \n \n39.9d When they inherit nothing  \n \nBrothers and sisters receive no inheritance when there is a \nfather or a son or a grandson.  \n \nBecause they are a lower generation than the father. When \nsomeone is lower than someone else, he does not inherit along \nwith him. He is excluded and omitted. In the case of a son, he is \nstronger in agnation than them. As for the second, the son of a son \nhas the same position as the son.  \n \n39.9e The absence of full siblings  \n \nIn the absence of full siblings, consanguine siblings are \nlike full siblings, both male and female.  \n \nIf there are several. If there is only one she inherits half. If there \nare males and females, the estate is divided between them with \nthe male getting twice the share of a female.  \n \n39.9f Remaining cases  \n \nIf there is a full sister and one or more consanguine sisters, \nthe full sister gets half and the remaining sisters share in \nthe sixth. If there are two full sisters, the half-sisters \nreceive nothing unless there is a brother with them. Then \nthey take whatever remains, with the male receiving the \nshare of two females.  \n \nThe sixth is to complete the two-thirds. Ibn Mas‟ud (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) said that the consanguine sister has no share in this case. If \nthere are two sisters, they take the full two-thirds and the others \nare removed and only inherit on the basis of agnation.  \n \n30.10 Uterine brothers and sisters  \n \n39.10a Their share  \n \nThe inheritance of a uterine sister and brother is the same: \na sixth, the same for either.  \n \nIf there is only one and there is no distinction between male and \nfemale.  \n \n39.10b When there are several  \n \nIf there are several of them, then the third is shared \nbetween them, each receiving the same amount.  \n \nWhether males, females, or both. They agree that what is meant \nby the brother and sister is His words \"If a man or woman has no \ndirect heirs but has a brother or sister, each of them gets a sixth,\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 4:12) is only the uterine sister. The one without heirs \nis the one who has no children or parent.  \n \n39.10c When they are excluded  \n \nThey are excluded from the inheritance by a child and his \nor her children, a father, or a paternal grandfather.  \n \nThis is complete exclusion. \"Child\" is a daughter or a son. A \nmaternal grandfather does not exclude because he does not \ninherit.  \n \n39.11 Full and consanguine brothers  \n \n39.11a The share of brothers  \n \nThe brother inherits the entire estate if he is the sole heir, \nif he is full brother or has the same father (consanguine). A \nfull brother excludes a consanguine brother.  \n \nHe is all 'asaba. A consanguine brother has this judgment when \nthere is no full brother. If there is a full brother, he excludes the \nhalf brother.  \n \n39.11b When there are several brothers  \n \nIf there is one or more brothers and sisters, full or \nconsanguine, then the estate is shared between them, with \nthe male having twice the share of a female.  \n \nThis is when there are no full brothers. This is repeated.  \n \n39.11c When there are other fixed heirs as well  \n \nIf there are those entitled to specific shares as well as the \nbrother, one begins with those with specific shares and he \ntakes what is left. Similarly what remains goes to the \nbrothers and sisters, with a male receiving twice the share \nof a female.  \n \nThat is because the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"What \nremains after the shares goes to the more entitled man,\" and the \nbrother is included in this. So what is left goes to the full brothers \nor if, there are none, the consanguine brothers, and that is divided \nbetween them.  \n \n39.11d If nothing is left  \n \nIf nothing is left, they receive nothing unless there are \nuterine brothers among the people of shares who inherited \na third. Then any full siblings, male and female, share \nequally with the uterine brothers in their third. This share \nis called \"shared\" (mushtarika). Consanguine brothers do \nnot share with the uterine brothers because they do not \nhave the same mother.  \n \nMales only, or females only, or both. The rest of the heirs inherit \ntwo-thirds, like the wife, mother or grandfather and that \ncompletes the estate.  \nThey share by virtue of having the same mother.  \n \nIt is called \"shared\" because the brothers share in the third, and is \nevery question in which there is a husband and mother or \ngrandmother, and two or more of the mother's offspring, and \n'asaba in the form of full siblings. This is also known as the \nHimariyya case. That is because the case was presented to Umar \nibn al-Khattab (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and he wanted to judge the \nelimination the full brothers, and one of them said, \"Give. Even if \nour father was a donkey (himar), do we not have the same \nmother?\" So he (radhi‟Allahu anhu) judges a third for all of them \nequally, full and uterine siblings, the portion of the man the same \nas the portion of the female.  \n \n39.11e Remaining sisters are accommodated  \n \nIf there remains any full or consanguine or sisters, \naccommodation is made for them.  \n \nThe sharing is invalid and it becomes one of the questions of 'awl. \nThe accommodation is that a half becomes three-sixths and is \nreduced to three-tenths. The two-thirds of the sisters becomes \nfour-sixths, and is reduced to four-tenths.]  \n \n39.11f Other cases  \n \nIf there is only one uterine brother or sister, the case is not \nmushtarika. The residual estate goes to the siblings \nwhether they are males, or males and females. If there are \nonly full or consanguine sisters, there is accommodation \nfor them.  \n \nWhat is left is a sixth. If there are males and females, the males \nreceive twice the share of the female.  \n \n39.11g Consanguine brother  \n \nA consanguine brother is like the full brother in the \nabsence of a full brother, except in the case of mushtarika.  \n \nThe full preconditions for full brotherhood are missing as they do \nnot share the same mother.  \n \n39.12 Nephews  \n \nThe son of a brother is like the brother in the absence of \nthe brother, whether he is a full or consanguine brother. \nThe son of a uterine brother does not inherit.  \n \nHe is in that position in agnation in particular, not in all aspects. \nOne of the aspects in which he differs is mentioned. The reason \nthat the son of uterine nephew does not inherit is that his father is \none of the people of specific shares and does not enter into \nagnation, and so he is like the son of the daughter.  \n \n39.13 Exclusion of heirs  \n \n39.13a The full brother  \n \nA full brother excludes a consanguine brother, but a \nconsanguine brother takes precedence over the son of a \nfull brother. The son of a full brother takes precedence \nover the son of a consanguine brother.  \n \nThis point is repeated. A consanguine brother is a degree higher \nthan the son of a full brother.  \n \n39.13b Exclusion and the paternal uncle  \n \nA son of a consanguine brother excludes a full paternal \nuncle. A full paternal uncle excludes a consanguine \npaternal uncle. A consanguine paternal uncle excludes the \nson of a full paternal uncle. The son of a full paternal uncle \nexcludes the son of a consanguine paternal uncle. So the \nnearer relative always has the greater entitlement.  \n \nThis is all by the closer level of degree, and the principle is general \nto all relatives.  \n \n39.14 Non-heirs  \n \n39.14a. Those who are non-heirs  \n \nThose who do not inherit include the children of sisters of \nwhatever sort, the sons of daughters, the daughters of a \nbrother of whatever sort, the daughters of a paternal \nuncle, the maternal grandfather, and a uterine paternal \nuncle.  \n \nShaikh al-Fakhani (rahmatullahi alaihi) said some texts have, \n\"Nor the maternal grandmother.\" It is also includes uncles.  \n \n39.14b Slavery is an impediment  \n \nA slave does not inherit, nor does a slave who is in the \nprocess of being freed.  \n \nThis includes the umm walad and mudabbar.  \n \n39.14c Difference of religion is an impediment  \n \nA Muslim does not inherit from an unbeliever nor an \nunbeliever from a Muslim.  \n \nThe majority position is that a Muslim does not inherit from an \nunbeliever and there is consensus that an unbeliever does inherit \nfrom a Muslim.  \n \n39.14d Others  \n \nOthers who do not inherit are: the son of a uterine brother, \nthe maternal grandfather and the mother of the maternal \ngrandfather.  \n \nAlready mentioned.  \n \n39.15 More excluded heirs  \n \n39.15a. Others who are excluded  \n \nNor does the mother of the paternal grandfather inherit \nalong with her son, the father of the deceased.  \n \nShe, in fact, does not inherit at all.   \n \n39.15b Uterine brothers  \n \nUterine brothers do not inherit with the paternal \ngrandfather, \nnor \nwith \nthe \nsons \nor \ndaughters \nor \ngrandchildren through a son. Siblings of any sort do not \ninherit with the father.  \n \nThis is repeated.  \n \n39.15c Paternal uncles  \n \nA paternal uncle does not inherit with the paternal \ngrandfather nor the son of a brother with the paternal \ngrandfather.  \n \nBecause the level of the grandfather is that of the brother, and the \nbrother excludes his son and those in his rank.  \n \n39.16 Impediment of homicide  \n \n39.16a Homicide is a bar to inheritance  \n \nThe murderer does not inherit either the estate or blood \nmoney. Someone guilty of accidental homicide does not \ninherit any of the blood money, but does inherit from the \nestate.  \n \nThis is about the person who kills the deceased. As for the one \nwho kills deliberately without transgression, like the ruler \nexecuting someone from whom he inherits for a hadd obliged on \nhim, or like someone killing his father who is a bandit, they do \ninherit.  \n \nIn the case of accidental homicide, he is excluded in one place and \nnot in another. For example, there are two brothers and one of \nthem kills the other, then the mother inherits a sixth from the \nbrother and the rest is for the two brothers together, because the \nbrother excludes her from a third to a sixth and she inherits a \nthird of the blood money because the killer does not inherit blood \nmoney and so he does not exclude her.  \n \n39.16b Other impediments  \n \nOther impediments to inheritance are negation of lineage \nby the li'an divorce, and difference in the order of death, as \nwhen a relative dies on a journey or under a collapsed \nbuilding \nand \nthe \nearlier \nis \nunaware \nof \nthat \nthe \nprecondition is missing, i.e. the death of the heir must be \nafter the death of the one who leaves the inheritance.  \n \n39.17 Effect of exclusion  \n \nAnyone who does not inherit for some reason cannot then \nexclude another heir.  \n \nExcept in the five cases mentioned in the Usul.  \n \n39.18 Inheritance by a spouse divorced or married in the \nfinal illness  \n \n39.18a A woman finally divorced in the final illness  \n \nA woman who has been trebly divorced in the final illness \nof her husband inherits from her husband, but if she dies \nfirst, he does not inherit from her. The same ruling applies \nif the divorce was a single one and he dies of that illness \nafter her ‘Idda has finished.  \n \nShe inherits from him because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) forbade excluding an heir by doing that. 'Uthman \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) judged that the wife of 'Abdu'r-Rahman ibn \n'Awf (radhi‟Allahu anhu) inherit from him after her ‘Idda was \nover. He (radhi‟Allahu anhu) had divorced her absolutely when he \nwas ill and he died of that illness. The man does not inherit from \nher because she is unrelated to him by virtue of the divorce. Even \nif her ‘Idda is over, she still inherits if he dies of that illness.  \n \n39.18b Divorce while he is in good health  \n \nIf someone in good health pronounces a single divorce \nagainst his wife, they still inherit from one another as long \nas she is still in her ‘Idda. If the ‘Idda has finished, they do \nnot inherit from one another.  \n \nThere is no suspicion about divorce when the person is healthy.  \n \n39.18c Marriage in the final illness  \n \nIf a man marries in his illness, they do not inherit from one \nanother.  \n \nBecause the marriage is invalid.  \n \n39.19 Grandmothers  \n \n39.19a. The ruling  \n \nA maternal grandmother inherits a sixth as does a paternal \ngrandmother.  \n \nAbsolutely because it is established that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) gave her a sixth. (Muwatta')  \n \n39.19b When there are two grandmothers  \n \nIf there are both of them, then the sixth is shared between \nthem, unless the maternal grandmother is a degree closer, \nin which case she is more entitled to it because there is a \ntext about her. If it is the paternal grandmother which is \ncloser, then the sixth is shared between them.  \n \nThe other inherits by way of analogy with the maternal \ngrandmother. The sixth is equally divided unless there is a \ngenerational difference. If, however, it is paternal one which is \ncloser, they share in the sixth because her position is based on \nanalogy, not text.  \n \n39.19c Which grandmothers inherit  \n \nAccording to Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi), only two \ngrandmothers \ninherit: \nthe \nfather's \nmother \nand \nthe \nmother's mother or their respective mothers. Zayd ibn \nThabit is reported to have allowed three grandmothers to \ninherit: one on the mother's side and two on the father's \nside: the father's mother and the mother of the father's \nfather. None of the Khalifs is reported to have allowed \nmore than two grandmothers to inherit.  \n \nThey take their place in their absence since the nearer excludes \nthe further as we stated.  \n \n39.20 Paternal grandfather  \n \n39.20a His share  \n \nIf there is only the paternal grandfather, he takes the \nentire estate.  \n \nThis is when there are no full or consanguine brothers or sisters or \nany others of the people of specific shares, like a daughter and \ndaughter of a son.  \n \n39.20b If there are other heirs  \n \nIf there is also a son or a son's son, the paternal \ngrandfather takes a sixth. If there are people with specific \nshares other than brothers and sisters, he is given a sixth. \nIf there is anything left over, it is his.  \n \nIf there are people with specific shares, he has a sixth of the basic \nestate as was mentioned. After the grandfather takes the sixth \nand the people take their shares, then he inherits any residual \nestate by agnation.  \n \n39.20c When there are brothers with the people of shares  \n \nIf there are also brothers along with the people of shares, \nthe grandfather has three choices and he can select \nwhichever he prefers, i.e. whichever is best for him. He can \nshare with the brothers, take a sixth of the total estate, or \ntake a third of the residue.  \n \nFull brothers or consanguine brothers. He can choose whichever \ncourse he prefers.  \n \n39.20d When there are only brothers  \n \nIf there are only brothers inheriting with him, he shares \nwith them if it is one or two brothers, or what is their \nequivalent: four sisters. If there are more than two \nbrothers, he takes a third. So when inheriting with \nbrothers, he takes a third, or he divides the estate with \nthem, whichever seems better for him.  \n \nAnd there are no people with specific shares. A third refers to the \ntotal estate.  \n \n39.20e Consanguine brothers  \n \nConsanguine brothers inherit with the grandfather in the \nsame manner as full brothers if there are no full brothers. \nIf there are both full brothers and consanguine brothers, \nthe full brothers may count the consanguine brothers with \nthem to reduce the share of the grandfather. Then they are \nmore entitled than them to that.  \n \nAn exception to this is the mushtarika case which was already \nmentioned.  \n \n39.20f An exception  \n \nAn exception is when there is, in addition to the \ngrandfather, a full sister who has a consanguine brother or \nsister or both. She takes her half of the estate and \nsurrenders what is left to them. Sisters are not enriched at \nthe expense of the grandfather, except in the case of al-\ngharra' which will be explained later.  \n \nShe takes what she would have taken if she had been alone. The \nsister does not get anything when there is a grandfather except in \nthe case known as the Akdariyya or Gharra', in which the sister \nreceives a share with the grandfather.  \n \n39.21 The patron [mawla]  \n \n39.21a The ruling of the client  \n \nWhen the mawla [patron] is the only heir, he or she \ninherits all of the estate, whether the patron is a man or a \nwoman. If there are people with shares as well, then the \npatron takes what is left after they have taken their \nshares.  \n \nThe mawla is the emancipator. When the deceased has no one \nwith a fixed share nor any agnates, the emancipator inherits by \nvirtue of agnation. The wala' goes to the person who sets a slave \nfree because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \nwala' is to flesh like flesh of lineage.\"  \n \nIf there are those entitled shares, and there are no agnates, he \ntakes the remainder because he inherits by agnation and that was \nthe judgment of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). An \nexample is when he leaves a daughter: she takes half and he takes \nthe rest.  \n \n39.21b When there are agnates  \n \nA patron inherits nothing when there are agnates ('asaba), \nbut he is more entitled than uterine relatives who have no \nshare in the Book of Allah azza wa jall. Only uterine \nrelatives who have a share in the Book of Allah azza wa jall \ninherit.  \n \nWhen the deceased has agnates because they inherit by lineage. \nHe is more entitled than uterine relatives because they have no \nagnation and so share.  \n \n39.21c A female patron  \n \nA woman only inherits by wala' from those she herself set \nthe slave free, or through subsequent freeing or childbirth \n[by the slave she set free].  \n \nOnly those she herself set free, or those set free by the one she set \nfree, without or without her permission. Abdullah ibn 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) says, \"Freeing is clear since a woman frees a \nslave and he in turn he frees a slave. The freed slave dies first and \nthen the one he freed dies.\"  \n \nAs for childbirth, there are further details regarding it. When she \nfrees a slavegirl who is pregnant, then the wala' of the slavegirl \nand the child belong to the woman who set her free. The wala' of \nthose the freed slavegirl bears after being frees goes to the patron \nof their father, i.e. those who freed the father. If the father has no \npatrons, it goes to the treasury.  \n \n39.22 Accommodation by reduction [Awl]  \n \n39.22a When it takes place  \n \nWhen the combined shares known in the Book of Allah \nazza wa jall are more than the estate, then all of them are \nreduced and the shares are reduced proportionately.  \n \nWhat is said in this question is that the asl of the share is \nestablished to solve the case. Each heir with a fixed share is given \nhis share and then they are all added together. If the total is equal \nor less than the total estate, there is no accommodation. If, \nhowever, the sum is greater than it, you know that there must be \naccommodation, like the Minbariyya case. Its thirds, sixth and \neighth are more than twenty-four, When there is accommodation, \nthe share is put in the place it reaches in the shares, which is \ntwenty-seven. The Minbariyya is an example of that. It is a wife, \ntwo parents, and two daughters. The two daughters have two-\nthirds, each of the parents has a sixth and the wife has an eighth. \nThe share of the parents is combined and we are content with one, \nwhich is one of six. We add to it the share of the daughters. The \nshare of the wife agrees with the product of six by half and so \nthree times eight gives twenty-four. The daughters have sixteen \nfor the two-thirds, the father's six is four, and the mother has four. \nThis is twenty-four. Then we need the wife's share, so \naccommodate her eighth into three shares and then the total is \ntwenty-seven.  \n \n39.22b Al-Gharra'  \n \nThere is no accommodation for a sister when there is a \ngrandfather except in the gharra' case. This is when a \nwoman \ndies \nleaving \na \nhusband, \nmother, \nfull \nor \nconsanguine sister and a paternal grandfather. The \nhusband gets half, the mother a third, and the grandfather \na sixth. Since the estate is exhausted, there must be \naccommodation for the sister's share of half, which is \nthree. Then the share of the grandfather is added to her \nshare, and the total of that is divided between them in \nthirds. She has a third and he has two-thirds, and so there \nare twenty-seven shares.  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) named the case this. The \nquestion is one of sixths. Half is three, a third is two and a sixth is \none. So by accommodation, the question becomes one of nine. Then \nthe grandfather says to the sister, \"You cannot have more in the \ninheritance because you are with me like a brother, so return \nwhat you have, which is three, to what I have, which is a share so \nthat we can divide it with the male having twice the share of a \nfemale. Four to three is not sound and does not agree and so three, \nthe number of the separate parts for accommodation of the shares, \nis multiplied, which gives 9 and so it is two: the three for the \nhusband multiplied into the three by nine. The sister and \ngrandfather have four multiplied by three which is twelve and the \nsister takes her third which is four and the grandmother takes her \nthird, which is eight.  \n \n \n \nChapter 40. A General Chapter on the Legal \nStatus of Various Practices \n \n \nThis deals with things which are fara’id [obligatory], mandatory \nor stressed Sunnah or recommended. He starts with fiqh topics:  \n \n40.1. Wudu'  \n \n40.1a Its status  \n \nWudu' for the prayer is obligatory. It is derived from \nwada'a [cleanliness].  \n \nIt is obligatory for both obligatory or voluntary prayers. Shaikh \nZarruq (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"This is outwardly by removing \nfilth and inwardly expiation of wrong actions.\" Lest someone \nimagine that all its elements are obligatory, he goes into further \ndetails.  \n \n40.1b Sunnah elements  \n \nHowever, rinsing the mouth, inhaling water through the \nnose and wiping the ears in it are Sunnah.  \n \nEach of these parts is a Sunnah.  \n \n40.1c Siwak [Cleaning the teeth]  \n \nSiwak is recommended and desired.  \n \nThis is when doing wudu'. It is very desirable.  \n \n40.1d Wiping over leather socks  \n \nWiping over leather socks is an allowance (rukhsa) and \nmitigation.  \n \nIt is permitting something normally not allowed. It is permitted \nboth while resident and while traveling with certain preconditions \nwhich were already mentioned.  \n \n40.2 Ghusl  \n \n40.2a Obligatory ghusl  \n \nGhusl on account of janaba, menstruation and lochia is \nobligatory.  \n \nJanaba is due to ejaculation or penetration.  \n \n40.2b Sunnah ghusl  \n \nThe ghusl on Jumu'a is Sunnah.  \n \nIt is a stressed Sunnah. If it is for attending the Jumu'a, it is \nmandatory.  \n \n40.2c Recommended ghusl  \n \nA ghusl for the two ‘Ids is recommended.  \n \nThis is the well-known position. It is also said that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.2d Ghusl when becoming Muslim  \n \nIt is obligatory for someone who becomes Muslim to \nperform ghusl because he is in janaba.  \n \nThis is a general assumption. The ghusl is on account of janaba. If \nit is verified that there has been no janaba, it is not mandatory.  \n \nHashiyya: The well-known position is that one has a ghusl before \nsaying the shahadah.  \n \n40.2e Washing the dead  \n \nGhusl for the dead is a Sunnah.  \n \nWashing him unless he is a martyr from a battle or a miscarriage \nwho has not cried. It is forbidden to wash the martyr.  \n \nHashiyya: The well-known position of the Maghribis is that it is \nSunnah while the Iraqis say that it is fard kifayah.  \n \n40.3 The Prayer  \n \n40.3a The obligatory prayer and its elements  \n \nThe five prayers are obligatory, as is saying the takbir al-\nIhram. The rest of the takbirs are Sunnah.  \n \nHash: Saying, \"Allahu Akbar\". This is for those who can say it \nproperly. If one cannot properly articulate it, he begins the prayer \nby the intention. Imam Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that all \nthe takbirs are one Sunnah which differs from the position of \nShaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) that each one is a \nSunnah.  \n \nBeginning the prayer with the intention of performing the \nobligation is obligatory.  \n \nThe intention is within the words of the takbir. If it is later than \nthat, it is not satisfied. Nor is it satisfied if it is a lot before it. If it \nis made a little before it, it satisfies the requirement. The most \ncomplete form is that the intention accompany the takbir.  \n \nRaising the hands is Sunnah.  \n \nRaising the hands only refers to the takbir al-ihram and not the \nrest of the takbirs. It is also said that it is recommended.  \n \nThey are raised opposite the ears or a little below them.  \n \nRecitation of the Fatiha in the prayer is obligatory and \nreciting more of the Holy Qur'an is a mandatory Sunnah.  \n \nRecitation of the Fatiha is obligatory for the Imam and the person \npraying alone in every rak'at. The obligation is satisfied by the \nImam in the case of someone following an Imam.   \n \nStanding, bowing and prostration are obligatory.  \n \nStanding in the prayer is obligatory for the one who is able to do \nit. If someone omits any of the obligatory standing, bowing and \nprostration, the prayer becomes invalid.  \n \nThe first sitting is Sunnah and the second is obligatory.  \n \nThe first sitting contains the two tashahhuds.  \n \nSaying the salam is obligatory and turning the head to \nright while saying it a little is Sunnah.  \n \nThe final salam which ends the prayer is obligatory for every \nprayer, but not the prostration of recitation.  \n \nNot speaking in the prayer is obligatory and the \ntashahhud is Sunnah.  \n \nThe only speaking allowed in the prayer is to correct the Imam, \nwhich should be kept to a minimum or else it invalidates the \nprayer. The two tashahhuds are Sunnah according to the well-\nknown position.   \n \n40.3b Qunut  \n \nThe Qunut in the Subh prayer is good, but not Sunnah.  \n \nThe Qunut done silently is recommended, but not a strong Sunnah \nand so there is no prostration owed by the one who forgets it.  \n \nFacing qibla is obligatory.  \n \nFacing the qibla is obligatory in every prayer with bowing and \nprostration and other prayers like the funeral prayer, except in \nintense fear in face of the enemy or illness when there is no one to \nmove the invalid towards qibla. He then prays however he can.  \n \n40.4 Other prayers  \n \n40.4a The Jumu'a prayer  \n \nThe Jumu'a prayer and going to it are obligatory.  \n \nHash: It is individual obligation for every free adult male. There \nmust be a special intention for it as Jumu'a. Shaikh al-Lakhmi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), however, said that it is a fard kifayah and \nShaikh ibn Wahb (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.4b The witr prayer  \n \nThe witr prayer is a mandatory Sunnah,  \n \nMandatory Sunnah‟s are stressed, and the most mandatory of \nthem is the witr, then the ‘Id prayers, then the eclipse and then \nthe rain prayer.   \n \n40.4c Other mandatory Sunnah’s  \n \nas are the two ‘Id prayers, the eclipse prayer, the rain \nprayer, and the fear prayer.  \n \nHash: The position which is relied on is that the prayer for a lunar \neclipse is recommended.  \n \n40.4d The fear prayer  \n \nThe fear prayer is mandatory Sunnah since Allah azza wa \njall commanded it. It is an act by which they obtain the \nexcellence of the group prayer.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall commanded the fear prayer when He says, \n\"When you are with them and are leading them in the prayer\" \n(Holy Qur‟an 4:101-3) The prayer in itself is obligatory, and \nSunnah in the form mentioned.  \n \n40.5 Ghusl before entering Makka  \n \nIt is recommended to have a ghusl before entering Makka.  \n \n40.6 Joining prayers  \n \n40.6a. Rainy nights  \n \nJoining prayers on a rainy night is mitigation. The Rightly-\nguided khalifs did it.  \n \nJoining Maghrib and 'Isha' when it is dark and muddy. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) did it and he is the model as did \nthe Rightly Guided Khalifs.  \n \n40.6b Joining in the hajj  \n \nJoining at 'Arafa and Muzdalifa is a mandatory Sunnah.  \n \nAt 'Arafa it is Dhuhr and 'Asr and at Muzdalifa it is Maghrib and \n'Isha'.  \n \n40.6c Travelers  \n \nA traveler joining prayers in an urgent journey is an \nallowance.  \n \nIn a mandatory journey like performing the obligatory hajj or \nrecommended or permitted journey, like a voluntary hajj or for \ncommerce. The apparent meaning is that the journey must be \nurgent, and that is what is in the Mudawwana, but that is not a \nprecondition in the Mukhtasar.  \n \nHash: There is no allowance for it in a forbidden journey, like one \ninvolving robbery, or a disliked one, like hunting for pleasure.  \n \n40.6d A sick person  \n \nA sick person joining prayers when he fears he will lose \nconsciousness is a concession. The same applies to joining \nthem because it is easier for him.  \n \nThis is an allowance. When he joins the prayers and then does not \nlose consciousness at the time of the second prayer, he repeats the \nprayer. When he joins because of weakness, he joins them with \none wudu' and then it is an easement.  \n \n40.7 Fasting and prayer in a journey  \n \nNot fasting while traveling is an allowance and shortening \nthe prayer while traveling is mandatory.  \n \nThis is in a journey in which he can shorten the prayer. He can \nfast or not fast. The well known position is that fasting is better. \nShortening the prayer, however, is mandatory as it is one of the \nconfirmed Sunnah’s, but it is not unlawful to pray in full.  \n \n40.8 Supererogatory prayers  \n \n40.8a Fajr  \n \nThe two rak'ats of Fajr are desirable, and it is said that \nthey are Sunnah.  \n \nWith a particular intention. The well-known position is that they \nare desirable, and the second position is that of Shaikh ibn al-\nHajib (rahmatullahi alaihi), who follows Shaikh ibn 'Abdu'l-Barr \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n40.8b Duha  \n \nThe Duha prayer is supererogatory.  \n \nThe nafila is what is less than the Sunnah and the desirable.  \n \nHash: The Mukhtasar states that is excellent. Its minimum is two \nrak'ats and its maximum is eight rak'ats with the majority of the \npeople of the School. It is also said that it has no maximum. Its \ntime begins with the nafila becomes permitted.  \n \n40.8c Night prayers  \n \nPraying at night in Ramadan is supererogatory and there \nis great virtue in it. If someone does it with faith and in \nanticipation of a reward, he will be forgiven his past wrong \nactions. Praying at night in Ramadan and other times is \ndesirable and supererogatory.  \n \nThis is the tarawih prayers. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said in a sound hadith, \"Whoever prays at night in \nRamadan in faith and anticipation of the reward will be forgiven \nhis past wrong actions.\"  \n \nHash: Night prayers are a sign of the righteous. They are best \ndone in the last third of the night. This is the tahajjud.  \n \n40.9 The Funeral Prayer  \n \nThe prayer over dead Muslims is obligatory and the duty is \nsatisfied by those who perform it. The same applies to \ntaking them to burial. Washing them is a mandatory \nSunnah.  \n \nIt is a fard kifayah or Sunnah kifayah. As for the Sunnah of \nwashing, whoever says that the ghusl is Sunnah says that the \nprayer is Sunnah, and those who say that it is mandatory, say \nthey are both mandatory. It is most likely that both are \nmandatory.  \n \n40.10 Knowledge  \n \nThe same is true of seeking knowledge. It is a general \nobligation which is satisfied by those who perform it \nexcept for that knowledge which is obliged individually for \na man.  \n \nIt is mandatory for all the Muslims. Individually obliged \nknowledge is like tauhid, wudu', prayer, hajj, buying and selling \nby what is confirmed and established that it is not permitted for \nanyone to embark on a matter until he knows the ruling of Allah \nazza wa jall in it. This is about individual obligations which no one \ncan do for another.  \n \n40.11 Jihad and forts  \n \n40.11a Jihad  \n \nThe obligation of jihad is general and is satisfied by those \nwho perform it, unless the enemy attack the settlement of a \npeople in which case it become obligatory for them to fight \nthem provided the enemy are not twice their number or \nmore.  \n \nIt is a general obligation for the Muslims as a whole. If the enemy \nsuddenly attacks the settlement of the people, then it becomes an \nindividual obligation for male and female, free and slave. When, \nhowever, the enemy is twice the number of the Muslims, they are \npermitted to flee.  \n \n40.11b Ribat  \n \nRibat at the frontiers of the Muslims and defending them \nand fortifying them is mandatory and the duty is satisfied \nby those who undertake this.  \n \nStaying at the frontiers. This is a fard kifayah.  \n \n40.12 Fasting  \n \n40.12a Obligatory fasting  \n \nFasting the month of Ramadan is an obligation.  \n \nFor every responsible Muslim who is not menstruating or bleeding \nafter childbirth.  \n \n40.12b I'tikaf  \n \nI'tikaf is supererogatory.  \n \nNafila. It is staying in the mosque for dhikr and reciting the Holy \nQur'an. It is also said that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.12c Supererogatory fasting  \n \nVoluntary fasting is desirable. It is desirable to fast the day \nof 'Ashura', the month of Rajab, the month Sha'ban, the day \nof 'Arafa and the Day of Tarwiya. Fasting the Day of 'Arafa \nis better for someone not performing hajj than for the one \non hajj.  \n \nThis is fasting at times when it is not forbidden to fast. It is better \nexplained by the words of the Almighty, \"The steadfast will be \npaid their wages in full without any reckoning.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n39:10) Steadfastness is explained as meaning fasting.  \n \n'Ashura' is the 10th of Muharram.  \n \n[Hash: It is desirable to fast it based on what Sahih Muslim states \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said when he was \nasked about fasting the Day of 'Arafa. He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"It expiates the past and future year.\" He was asked about \nfasting 'Ashura' and said, \"It expiates the past year.\"  \n \n'Arafa is the 9th of Dhu'l-Hijja and Tarwiya is the eight of Dhu'l-\nHijja. It is better for the hajji not to fast the Day of 'Arafa.  \n \n40.13 Zakat  \n \nZakat on money, crops and livestock is obligatory. The \nzakat al-fitr is a Sunnah made obligatory by the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \nHash: Money means gold and silver, to exclude new filus, even if it \nis the currency. Trading good are also included.  \n \nZakat al-Fitr was made mandatory by the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam).  \n \nHash. It is said that it is Sunnah.  \n \n40.14 Hajj and 'Umra  \n \n40.14a Its ruling  \n \nMaking hajj to the House is obligatory and 'umra is a \nmandatory Sunnah.  \n \nIt is obligatory once in a lifetime. 'Umra is a confirmed Sunnah \nonce in a lifetime.  \n \n40.14b Its elements  \n \nThe talbiya is a mandatory Sunnah. The intention to \nperform the hajj is obligatory. Tawaf al-Ifada is obligatory \nand the sa'y between Safa and Marwa is obligatory. The \ntawaf connected to it is mandatory and the Tawaf al-Ifada \nis more stressed than it. The tawaf of Farewell is Sunnah.  \n \nThe Tawaf al-Ifada is after the return from 'Arafa. The tawaf \nconnected to Sa'y is the Tawaf of Arrival. If it is omitted, there is \na sacrifice owed for its omission. The Mukhtasar says that the \nTawaf of Farewell is recommended.  \n \n40.14c Further elements  \n \nSpending the night at Mina on the Day of 'Arafa is Sunnah. \nJoining prayers at 'Arafa is mandatory and standing at \n'Arafa is obligatory. Spending the night at Muzdalifa is a \nmandatory Sunnah. Stopping at the Mash'ar al-Haram is \ncommanded. Stoning the jamras is a mandatory Sunnah.  \n \nThere is no sacrifice owed by someone who misses the night at \nMina. \"Commanded\" here means recommended.  \n \n40.14d Shaving the head and kissing the Black Stone  \n \nThat is also true of shaving. Kissing the Black stone is a \nmandatory Sunnah.  \n \nShaving the head is a mandatory Sunnah for a man, not a woman. \nKissing the Black Stone is in the first circuit.  \n \nHashiyya: Shortening the hair is also allowed. Sacrifice is obliged \nfor the one who omits it or delays it. For women, the duty is to \nshorten it.  \n \n40.14e Ghusl during hajj  \n \nA ghusl for assuming ihram is Sunnah and two rak'ats at \nthat time is Sunnah.  \n \nA ghusl at 'Arafa is Sunnah and a ghusl for entering Makka \nis recommended.  \n \nGhusl for assuming ihram is Sunnah for both a man and a \nwoman, even if she is menstruating or has lochia. Ghusl at 'Arafa \nis Sunnah for standing at 'Arafa.  \n \n40.15 Group prayer  \n \n40.15a Its excellence  \n \nDoing the prayer in a group is twenty-seven times better \nthan praying alone.  \n \nOne version has 25. It is certainly far better than praying alone.  \n \n40.15b The prayer in particular mosques  \n \nPraying in the Masjid al-Haram and the Masjid of the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) alone is better than praying \nin other masajid. There is disagreement about the \ndifference in the amount of excellence between the Masjid \nal-Haram and the Masjid of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam). There is no disagreement that praying in the Masjid \nof the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) is better than a \nthousand prayers in other masajid except for the Masjid al-\nHaram. The people of Madina say that the prayer in the \nHoly Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) Masjid is better than \nthe prayer in the Masjid al-Haram, but less than a \nthousand times better. This is all about obligatory prayers. \nAs for voluntary prayers, they are better done at home.  \n \nThe Mosque of Jerusalem in next in excellence. This is the \ndisagreement about whether Makka or Madina is better. The well-\nknown position of the School is that Madina is better. The \nmeaning of the difference in their excellence is in the reward for \naction done in one of them is more than the other. There is also a \ndifference of opinion about whether the prayer in the masjid of \nMadina or better or in the Masjid al-Haram. Some say that the \nprayer in the Holy Prophet's (alaihi salat wa salam) Masjid is 700 \ntimes more excellent.  \n \nVoluntary prayers are better done at home because the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Put some of your prayers in \nyour houses.\"  \n \nHash: Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) related from \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that he preferred nafila prayers \nat home to nafila prayers in the Masjid of the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) except for visitors. He preferred that they do their \nnafila in the masjid.  \n \n40.15c The difference between prayer and tawaf  \n \nWe prefer for the people of Makka to do supererogatory \nprayers than to do tawaf, but tawaf is better than the \nprayer for visitors because of the little opportunity they \nhave to do.  \n \nThis is the position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). This is \nso that they do not crowd the visitors.  \n \n40.16 Looking at women  \n \nIt is an obligation to lower the eye and not look at \nforbidden women, but there is no harm in the first glance \nwhen it is not deliberate, not in looking at woman who \ndoes provoke desire nor in looking at a young woman for a \nlegitimate reason, such as identifying her and the like. \nThere is a similar allowance for someone proposing \nmarriage.  \n \nShaikh ibn al-Qattan (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that there is \nconsensus that no major wrong action is connected to the eye, but \nit is the faculty which brings the greatest harm to the heart and is \nquickest in destroying the din and this world. It is forbidden to \nlook at a woman who is not related within the prohibited degrees \nor a beardless youth for pleasure since Allah azza wa jall tells the \nbelievers, \"Lower your eyes.\" (Holy Qur‟an 24:30)  \n \nThere is no wrong action in the first glance which is not \nintentional nor at looking a woman for there is no attraction for \nmen. Identification is for marriage, or for sales purposes. The \nsame principle applies to the doctor and surgeon, which is what is \nmeant by \"the like\".  \n \nThere is an allowance for someone who intends to marry who \nwants to know what the woman is like. This is confined to the face \nand hands. There is an allowance for looking at the face since the \nface indicates beauty and the hands indicate the plumpness of the \nbody. The origin of that is the command of the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \n40.17 Immoral speech  \n \nIt is an obligation to guard one's tongue from lying, \nperjury, obscene language, backbiting, gossiping, and all \nfalsehood. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Anyone who believes in Allah azza wa jall and the Last \nDay should speak well or be silent.\" The Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Part of the excellence of a \nperson's Islam is his leaving alone what does not concern \nhim.\"  \n \nThis is one of the mandatory matters.  \n \nLying  \n \nHash: Lying is forbidden because Allah azza wa jall says, \"And \ncall down the curse of Allah upon the liars...\" (Holy Qur‟an 3:60) \nand the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There is no \ngood in lying.\" The consensus is that it is forbidden.  \n \nPerjury  \n \nA person should guard his tongue against perjury, which is \ntestifying to what he does not know, even if it actually happened.  \n \nHash: It is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"Shall I tell you of the greatest of wrong actions?\" and \nhe repeated that three times. They said, \"Yes, Rasulullah.\" He \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Associating others with Allah, azza \nwa jall, disobeying parents.\" He was reclining and sat up and said, \n\"And lying words and perjury.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) \ncontinued to repeat until they wished he would be silent.  \n \nObscene language [Fahsha']  \n \nHe should guard his tongue from obscene language, which is every \nforbidden word or deed.  \n \nBackbiting [ghiba]  \n \nHe should guard it against backbiting which is that someone says \nsomething about another which he dislikes behind his back. That \nexcludes him disliking for his obedience to be mentioned, because \nthis is praise, and praise is not like that. If he praises him for \nwhat he dislikes and does not have, that is forbidden because it is \na lie, not slander.  \n \nGossiping [namima]  \n \nGossiping is passing on words about someone to someone else for \ncorruption.  \n \nFalsehood [batil]  \n \n \nAll falsehood means words since their source is the tongue. What \nis meant by falsehood are words and falsehood is too varied to be \nenumerated. It is the opposite of the truth.  \n \nThen the author (rahmatullahi alaihi) offers evidence in the form \nof two sound hadiths. Even if they stem from specific cases, they \nare obligatory in general. It is generally seeking to guard the \ntongue against lying. In the first hadith it appears that he can \nchoose between speaking good or being silent about it. That is not \nsound because some words can be mandatory, like commanding \nthe correct and forbidding the bad. This is why it is not taken \nliterally. It means: He should speak good or be silent about evil, \ni.e. seeking by both courses to do good.  \n \nA person should leave all that does not concern him, which means \nall that does not bring him benefit in his deen or the Next World. \nThat which concerns him is that whose abandonment will cause \nhim to miss the reward. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Part of \nthe excellence of a person's Islam,\" not \"part of a person's Islam\" \nbecause that it is not the attribute of Islam, but part of its \nexcellence.  \n \n40.18 Taking a Muslim's life or property  \n \n40.18a The basic ruling  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has made the blood of Muslims, their \nproperty and their honor inviolable except for a right.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"Do not kill any person Allah has made \ninviolate, except by a legal right.\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:33) The same \napplies to the people of dhimma and treaty. Allah azza wa jall has \nmade their property inviolable when He says \"Do not consume one \nanother's property by false means\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:21) and the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The worst of usury in the \nsight of Allah azza wa jall is making a Muslim's honor fair game.\" \nWhat is meant is speaking about his honor, which is making it fair \ngame.  \n \n40.18b The exceptions to that rule  \n \nThe life of a Muslim is not lawful unless he apostasies after \nbelief, commits illicit sex after he is muhsan, kills someone \nwhen it is not a case of retaliation, or engages in \ncorruption in the earth or renounces the deen.  \n \nThe exception to this inviolability is for a legal right, which refers \nto the three matters which he mentioned. In property, anyone who \ndestroys something must pay for it.  \n \nThe cases when taking life is permitted are indicated here. In the \ncase of apostasy, he is asked to repent for three days. \"Corruption \nin the earth\" is banditry and highway robbery. Renouncing the \ndeen is to embrace the dogma of the people of the sects about \nwhom the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"They will \npass through the din like an arrow passes through game.\" In the \nMisbah, it goes through one side and comes out the other.  \n \n40.19 Sexual and related restrictions  \n \n40.19a Avoiding the unlawful  \n \nYou should keep your hands from what is not lawful to you \nin property, body or blood. Do not let your feet move after \nwhat is not lawful for you.  \n \nIn property it is like theft. In body it is touching other than one's \nwife or slavegirl. Blood includes both killing and wounding.  \n \n40.19b Sexual restrictions  \n \nDo not let your private parts or any of your body touch \nwhat is not lawful for you, Allah azza wa jall says, \"those \nwho guard their private parts – except from their wives or \nthose they own as slaves, in which case they are not \nblameworthy; but those who desire anything more than that \nare people who have gone beyond the limits .\" (Holy Qur’an \n23:5-7)  \n \nDo not advance to illicit sex.  \n \n40.19c Prohibition  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden obscenity, whether open \nor secret, and approaching women sexually when they are \nbleeding from menstruation or lochia. He has forbidden \nmarriage to the women who were already mentioned.  \n \nAllah azza wa jall says, \"My Lord has forbidden indecency, both \nopen and secret.\" (Holy Qur‟an 7:3) Shaikh at-Tata'i (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said that fawahish includes every ugly word or action \nwhich appears on the limbs or is in the consciousness and hearts. \nAllah azza wa jall forbade vaginal intercourse with women during \nmenstruation or lochia. Other than looking is forbidden to enjoy \nwhat is between the waist and knee, even without intercourse, \nand from above a barrier. There is nothing wrong in looking. The \nconfirmation of this is the words of the Almighty, \"Do not \napproach them until they have purified themselves.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n2:220) He already mentioned the women it is forbidden to marry.  \n \nHash: The consensus is that it is permitted to enjoy what is above \nit. As for what is below the waist other than the vagina, there are \ntwo positions. The most famous is that it is forbidden. There is \ndisagreement about the reason for the prohibition. It is said that it \nis based on devotion (i.e. no logical reason) and it is said that it is \nfeared that any child conceived from such intercourse will suffer \nfrom leprosy, and it is said that it is feared that it will harm the \nman. This prohibition applies to non-Muslim women as well as \nMuslim women because the prohibition is directed to the husband.  \n \n40.20 Doing what is good and avoiding doubtful things  \n \n40.20a. Good is commanded  \n \nAllah azza wa jall commanded eating what is good, which \nis the lawful. It is only lawful for you to eat what is lawful \nor to wear what is lawful or to ride what is lawful or live in \nwhat is lawful. Everything else which you use must be \nlawful.  \n \nThe halal is that which has no consequences and is not connected \nto the a right of Allah azza wa jall or a right for others, That is \nindicated by His words, \"O you who believe! Eat of the good things \nWe have provided for you.\" (Holy Qur‟an 2:171) What is meant \nhere by eating (akl) is use. When you know that Allah azza wa jall \nhas commanded you to eat what is lawful, it is only lawful for you \nto consume what is lawful. Ibn Abbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \n\"Allah azza wa jall does not accept the prayer of someone who has \nthe haram in his belly.\" Also, \"If someone eats a morsel of the \nharam, Allah azza wa jall will not accept his actions for forty \ndays.\"  \n \nIn riding, it is not lawful to ride a usurped or stolen mount. Living \nin a dwelling bought by stolen goods is unlawful.  \n \n40.20b Doubtful things  \n \nBesides good things there are doubtful things. If someone \nleaves them, he is safe, and if someone takes them, he is \nlike someone who grazes around a private preserve: he is \nlikely to stray into it.  \n \nBesides the lawful, there are things whose legality is uncertain. A \nprivate preserve linguistically is that which is protected by power \nand which others are forbidden to graze in it. What is meant is to \navoid the doubtful and confine oneself to the lawful. This is based \non the famous hadith: 'The halal is clear and the haram is clear. \nBut between the two there are doubtful things about which most \npeople have no knowledge. Whoever exercises caution with regard \nto what is doubtful, shows prudence in respect of his deen and his \nhonor. Whoever gets involved in the doubtful things is like a \nherdsman who grazes his animals near a private preserve [hima]. \nHe is bound to enter it.\"  \n \n40.21 Injury to property rights  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden taking property falsely. \nFalse \nacquisition \nincludes \nmisappropriation, \ntransgression, treachery, usury, bribery, gambling, risk, \nadulteration, deceit and duping.  \n \ni.e. taking it in an impermissible manner. What is meant is not \nactually \"eating\"  \n \nThe text uses 'akl'. It is a metaphor for taking because \nconsumption is often done by eating.  \n \nUsurpation [ghasb] is taking wrongful possession of someone \nelse's property.  \n \nHash: This is not like highway robbery (hiraba) where the rightful \nowner has no access to help.  \n \nTransgression (ta'addi) is in the 'ariyya and renting.  \n \nHash: Like increasing the size of the land loaned to a person or \nincreasing the burden carried by a rented animal.  \n \nTreachery [khiyana] is to be treacherous towards someone \nregarding his property, family or trust or himself.  \n \nUsury is to increase the price or term in a manner not permitted.  \n \nSuht is a bribe which a witness takes for his testimony or a judge \nfor his rulings.  \n \nHash: This also includes things like the earning of a prostitute.  \n \nGambling is earning by backgammon and other forms.  \n \nRisk [gharar] is excessive risk like buying a bird in the air or a \nfish in the sea. A small risk is allowed because sales cannot be \nachieved without it like grains sold which might contain some \nmud.  \n \nAdulteration [ghashsh] is to mix something base with the goods.  \n \nHash: Other forms of this is perfuming garments and watering \nanimals after giving them salt (so they appear plump).  \n \nDeceit [khadi'a] is by word or deed to achieve a worldly desire. \nThis is like when he says to a man who comes to him, \"Your day is \nblessed. You have your desire,\" until he buys from him. Duping \n[khalaba] is like deceit.  \n \n40.22 Forbidden meat  \n \n40.22a Meat which is forbidden  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden carrion, blood, pork and \nwhat is hallowed to other than Allah azza wa jall and what \nis sacrificed to other than Allah azza wa jall, and that \nwhose death has been caused by falling from a mountain or \nbeing hit with a stick or something else, or strangled with \na rope or something else.  \n \n Carrion other than that of the sea.  \n \nHash: There is disagreement about the reason for the prohibition \nof the first three. It is said that is a pure act of devotion. It is said \nthat the reason is logical: carrion is dangerous to the health, blood \ncauses the heart to become hard, and pork removes shame [i.e. \nleads to open lewdness].  \n \n\"Hallowed\" means slaughtered with the voices raising mentioning \nother than Allah azza wa jall, like the name of the Messiah (Isa \n[AS]). He also forbade what is sacrificed to things like idols. There \nis nothing wrong, however, in eating the food of the People of the \nBook, which is a seeming contradiction inasmuch as the \nslaughtered animals of the People of the Book are mostly directed \nto Nabi 'Isa (alaihi salam), for instance, which would be \nslaughtering for other than Allah azza wa jall. Abdullah ibn \n'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) answered what was said here means \nthe sacrifices of the Magians. In short, it would seem that the \nslaughtered animals of the People of the Book are absolutely \neaten, whether they are hallowed to other than Allah azza wa jall \nor not, but that is not the case. The fiqh of the matter is that the \nanimals of the Kitabis are not lawful when they are specifically \nhallowed to other than Allah azza wa jall and the slaughtered \nanimals of the Magians are never lawful.  \n \nWhat falls from a mountain is not eaten, even if it is slaughtered \nbecause one does not know what the cause of death was, Helping \nto die is with an arrow or stick or the like the stone. Strangled \nanimals includes what is strangled between two branches. The \nevidence for prohibition is the words of Allah azza wa jall, \n\"Forbidden for you are carrion, blood and pork\" (Holy Qur‟an 5:4)  \n \n40.22b Dire necessity  \n \nUnless there is dire need of such meat, like carrion.  \n \nWhen one is forced to eat that, it is not unlawful to eat it, like \ncarrion of animals which are eaten or that of animals which are \nnot eaten, except for the human being.  \n \n40.22c The extent to which it is allowed  \n \nWhen an animal reaches a state after which it cannot live \ndue to those reasons, then there is no slaughter of it. There \nis no harm in someone compelled by necessity eating \ncarrion and having his fill and taking provision from it. \nWhen he has no need of it, then he throws it away.  \n \nThis is what will customarily result in death. It appear from what \nhe says that this is the case whether you administer the mortal \nblow or not. This is different from the School. The specifics in the \nSchool is that if has definitely or probably receives a mortal \nwound, there is no slaughter in that. If that is not the case, \nslaughter is accomplishes in it, even if it must die. The one forced \nby necessity can eat. One might think that not eating is better, \nbut that is not the case. Eating is mandatory as Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said since the Almighty says, \"Do not kill \nyourselves.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:29)  \n \nHe eats his fill as Shaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) says. \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he only eats what will \nsustain life. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that he can \ntake provision from it. It is also said that he does not do that. It is \nmandatory to discard it when it is no longer needed.  \n \nHash: The position of the majority is that he eats his fill.  \n \n40.22d Skins of carrion  \n \nThere is no harm in using its skin when it as been tanned, \nbut one does not pray on it nor sell it.  \n \nThe skin of carrion. If it has not been tanned it is used at all. One \ndoes not pray it or sell it in the well-known position.  \n \n40.22e Skins of beasts of prey  \n \nThere is no harm in praying on the skins of beasts of prey \nwhen they have been slaughtered, and they can be sold.  \n \n40.22f Hair and wool  \n \nThe wool and hair of carrion are used as well as what is \nremoved from them while alive. We prefer that it be \nwashed. One does not use its feathers, horns, claws or \nteeth. It is disliked to use the tusks of elephants.  \n \nShaikh ibn Habib (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that it is mandatory \nthat it be washed. What is meant by feathers is the quills of the \nfeathers of dead birds because the down is like hair in its purity \nby cutting. As for horns, they are not used at all absolutely, either \nthe tip or the base. This is when the elephants have not been \nslaughtered, although some take it to mean that it is forbidden.  \n \n40.22g Pigs  \n \nAll of a pig is forbidden, but there is an allowance to use its \nhair [bristles].  \n \nThe meat, fat, bones and skin of a pig are forbidden: eating it or \nusing it. The bristles are allowed because they are not impure in \nthe well-known position.   \n \n40.23 Forbidden drink  \n \n40.23a Its definition  \n \nAllah azza wa jall has forbidden drinking wine, a little or a \nlot. The drink of the Arabs at that time was date wine. The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) made it clear that if a \nlot of something intoxicates, then a little of it is unlawful. \nAny drink which drugs the mind and intoxicates it, \nwhatever it is, is considered to be 'wine'. Furthermore, \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The One made it \nunlawful to drink it made it unlawful to sell it.\"  \n \nIt says in the commentary of the 'Umda al-Ahkam that one of the \nshaikhs said, \"Even he puts the amount on the end of a needle \nonto his tongue, he receives the hadd.\" What was drunk at the \ntime of the prohibition was date wine. That was made by crushing \ndates and putting them in vessels and putting water on it and \nleaving it to ferment. A little of it is unlawful, even if it does not \nintoxicate.  \n \nWhat is meant is not everything which drugs the intellect, but \nwhat drugs it as a result of intoxicate, i.e. rapture and joy. In \nSahih Muslim, the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"Every intoxicant is wine, and every wine is unlawful.\"  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade selling it. Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) related in the Muwatta' that ibn \nAbbas (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said \"A man gave the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) a small water-skin of wine. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said to him, 'Don't you know that \nAllah azza wa jall has made it haram?' He said, 'No.' Then a man \nat his side whispered to him. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) asked what he had whispered and the man replied, 'I told \nhim to sell it.' The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, 'The \nOne who made drinking it haram has made selling it haram.' The \nman then opened the water-skins and poured out what was in \nthem.\"  \n \n40.34b Mixing drinks  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) also forbade mixing \ndrinks, whether they are mixed when they are set aside for \nfermentation or are mixed when they are drunk.  \n \nThis is a prohibition of drinking them because the prohibition is \nconnected to actions. There are two forms. One is ripening dates \nand raisins and then mixing them and putting them in one vessel, \npouring water on them and then leaving them to ferment. The \nsecond is when they are fermented on their own and then mixed \nfor drinking.  \n \n40.34c Fermentation vessels  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade storing/ fermenting juices \nin gourds or in pitch-lined containers.  \n \nThese are gourds which are lined with pitch which are quick to \ncause fermentation.  \n \n40.24 Other forbidden meat  \n \n40.24a Beasts of prey and domestic animals  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade eating every \nanimal with fangs and the meat of domestic donkeys. \nIncluded with donkeys is horsemeat and the meat of mules \nsince Allah azza wa jall says, \"both to ride and for \nadornment.\" (Holy Qur’an 16:8) None of these are \nslaughtered except wild asses.  \n \nIt is all beasts with fangs with which it attacks and which prey, \nlike tigers, panthers, and wolves. The fox is not a best of prey, \neven though it has fangs, because it does not attack or prey.  \n \nHorse meat and mules as well as donkeys are forbidden. That is \nbecause Allah azza wa jall mentioned flocks and said, \"There is \nwarmth for you in them, and various uses and some you eat.\" (Holy \nQur‟an 16:5) When He mentioned these, He only mentioned riding \nand adornment. That indicates that only that is permitted in \nthem. Slaughtering any of these, including beasts of prey, does not \nrender it eatable with the exception of wild asses.  \n \n40.24b Birds of prey  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in eating birds of prey and those \nwith talons.  \n \nAll such birds are eatable.  \n \nHashiyya: One does not eat bats because they are unclean.  \n \n40.25 Treatment of parents  \n \nIt is an obligation to be dutiful to one's parents, even if \nthey are evildoers or idolaters. One should speak kindly to \nthem and keep their company with correct politeness, but \nnot obey them in disobedience as Allah azza wa jall states. \nA believer must ask for forgiveness for his parents if they \nare believers.  \n \nWhether they are evildoers in action or creed. Part of correct \nbehavior is to lead the one who is blind to the church and to carry \nthem to it, and to give them what they spend in their festivals. He \nmust not raise his voice above their voice. He should be kind to \nthem in all that the Shari‟ah allows.  \n \nOne does not obey them in disobeying Allah azza wa jall as Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"If they endeavor to make you associate \nsomething with Me about which you have no knowledge do not \nobey them.\" (Holy Qur‟an 29:7) He must ask forgiveness because of \nthe words of Allah azza wa jall, \"Say, 'Lord, show mercy to them as \nthey did in looking after me when I was small.\" (Holy Qur‟an \n17:24) He does not ask forgiveness for them after their death if \nthey are unbelievers by consensus.  \n \n40.26 Treatment of Fellow Muslims  \n \n40.26a Love for fellow Muslims  \n \nA believer must always protect believers and give them \ngood advice. No one reaches the reality of faith until \"he \nloves for his brother believer what he loves for himself.\" \nThat is related from the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam).  \n \nThis is friendship and showing love to them and not doing what \nwould alienate them, like envy and other such things. He must \ngive them good advice because that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said in a sound hadith, \"The din is good counsel,\" i.e. \nmost of the deen is good counsel, as he said, \"Hajj is 'Arafa.\" Those \npresent asked him, \"For whom, Rasulullah?\" He (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"To Allah azza wa jall, His Book, His Messenger, the \nleaders of the Muslims and their common folk.\"  \n \nGood counsel to Allah azza wa jall that you describe Him with \nwhat He describes Himself of necessary attributes and disconnect \nHim from what is not appropriate for Him. Good counsel for His \nBook is to recite it properly and obey its commands and avoid its \nprohibitions. Good advice for His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) is to believe in him and all that what he brought. Good \ncounsel for the leaders is to obey their commands and to follow the \nlaws which agree with the Shari‟ah in measures and weights and \nother things. Good counsel for the common is to guide them to \ntheir best interests and to treat them with truthfully.  \n \nHe mentions the extent of love which is to want for your fellow \nbeliever what you want for yourselves because it is the greatest \npillar and necessary for the maintenance of the pillars, and it is \nnot related that faith has any other pillars. The \"brother\" is \nmentioned to exclude the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) from \nthat because \"A person is not a believer until he loves the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) more than his wealth, his children \nand himself.\"  \n \n20.26b Maintaining ties with kin  \n \nHe must maintain ties with his relatives.  \n \nThat is every relative by lineage through mother or father.  \n \nHash: This maintaining of ties includes visiting relatives, \nspending on those who are in need, good words, asking about how \nthey are, overlooking their faults and helping them. It varies with \ndifferent relatives. What is meant are believing relatives, not \nunbelievers, except for dutifulness to parents. Visiting means \nthose who live nearby. Otherwise it is achieved through letters.  \n \n20.26c Duties owed to fellow Muslims  \n \nA believer must greet another believer when he meets him, \nvisit him when he is ill, wish him well when he sneezes, \nattend his funeral when he dies and defend him when he is \nabsent, publicly and in secret.  \n \nHe should initiate the greeting when he meets him. As for visiting \nthe one who is ill, part of the adab of that is that when he asks \nabout his condition, he shows him compassion and does not make \nhim despair. Wishing him well when he sneezes is to say to him, \n\"May Allah have mercy on you\" when he hears him praise Allah \nazza wa jall. He must attend his funeral: both the prayer and the \nburial. He should not slander him in his absence nor should he \nwish him ill.  \n \nHash: Visiting the ill is a fard kifayah. He should also make \nsupplication for the person who is ill and place his hand on his \nhand or his forehead to see how he is. He should not look at the \nprivate areas of the house or things one would normally not wish \nto be seen.  \n \n20.26d Impermissible shunning  \n \nOne does not shun his brother for more than three days. \nThe greeting ends the shunning, but he should not leave \noff speaking to him after the greeting.  \n \nShunning is not speaking to him or greeting him. Three days is \nbased on the words of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \"It \nis not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for more than three \ndays.\" It is understood from this that shunning for three days is \nallowed, even if shunning is forbidden in general since that is \ndifficult because of human nature which is rarely free of anger. \nThe greeting, if he intends it, ends the shunning. If the other \nreturns it, they both end the shunning. Otherwise only the greeter \nends it. It is recommended that he be easy and continue to speak \nto him, because leaving it after giving the greeting is a bad \nopinion of him.  \n \n20.26e Permitted shunning  \n \nPermissible shunning is to shun someone with an \ninnovation or someone who openly commits major wrong \nactions provided he cannot punish him and is unable to \nadmonish \nhim \nor \nthe \nindividual \nwill \nnot \naccept \nadmonishment.  \n \nThis means a forbidden innovation like the Qadariyya who said \nthat good and evil come from man, not from Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nHash: Innovation is divided into forbidden and disliked. Forbidden \ninnovations also include saying that the Night Journey was only a \ndream and the Rafidiyya [extreme Shi'a] who reject Abu Bakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) and 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu).  \n \nSomeone who openly commits major wrong actions and makes no \nattempt to conceal them is like someone who drinks wine openly. \nThe place for shunning someone who openly commits wrong action \nis when he cannot punish him by the Shari‟ah by discipline and \nthe like, like types of ta'zir. If he cannot admonish him by the \ndifficulty to of mending him or if he will not accept it because of \nhis lack of sense and the like.  \n \n20.26f When talking about someone is not backbiting  \n \nIn these two cases, mentioning the situation of someone is \nnot backbiting nor is it backbiting when someone is \nconsulted about someone's character for the sake of \nmarriage or joint enterprise or the like, nor for the \npurpose of assessing the character of a witness and the \nlike.  \n \nIn these two cases, mentioning their state of iniquity in creed or \nlimb. When he is asked about them, he says about the innovator, \n\"So-and-so's dogma is false since it differs from the people of the \nSunnah.\" In respect of the one who openly commits wrong action, \nhe says, \"So-and-so persists in major wrong actions.\" It is \npermitted to mention what he displays but forbidden to mention \nhis other faults. This is not backbiting.  \n \nIf someone is asking about someone to marry, as when he says, \"I \nwant to marry the daughter of so-and-so but I do not know his \nstate,\" then he can mention his state to advise him and nothing \nmore. The same is true if the inquirer is planning on entering into \na partnership and the like and the person wants to know if he can \nbe trusted. The same holds for assessing the character of a \nwitness, or someone for which act as an Imam for the prayers. \nThey ask about him and he can inform them of his shortcoming. \nIndeed, he must do that. It is the same in dealing with the \ncharacter of a transmitter out of fear that he will attribute \nsomething to the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) which he \ndid not say.  \n \n20.26g Noble character  \n \nIt is noble character to pardon the one who wrongs you \nand to give to the one who refused you and to join the one \nwho cut you off.  \n \nThat is because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"My \nLord commanded me to connect those who cut me off, to give to \nthose who deprive me, and to pardon those who wrong me.\"  \n \n20.26h Four hadiths about good character  \n \nThe sum of good adab and its peak can be derived from \nfour hadiths.  \n \nThese are the qualities which amount to good character. They are \ncalled adab because they are learned. The peak is the acme of \ngood.  \n \n1. The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Anyone \nwho believes in Allah azza wa jall and the Last Day should \nspeak well or be silent.\"  \n \nThe whole hadith is: \"Anyone who believes in Allah azza wa jall \nand the Last Day should not harm his neighbor. Anyone who \nbelieves in Allah azza wa jall and the Last Day should honor his \nguest. Anyone who believes in Allah azza wa jall and the Last Day \nshould speak well or be silent.\" He should speak good and be \nrewarded for it or be silent from an evil for which he will he \npunished.  \n \n2. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Part of the excellence of a \nperson's Islam is his leaving alone what does not concern \nhim.\"  \n \nIt is that in which there is no benefit for him either in this world \nor the Next.  \n \n3. He (alaihi salat wa salam) told the one who asked him for \nsuccinct advice, \"Do not get angry.\"  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) repeated it several times. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) meant that not keeping angry is \nan immense matter because anger has ruinous consequences in \nthis world and the next and not getting angry has benefits and \nfruits in the Next World which are beyond number because Allah \nazza wa jall created anger from the Fire and kneaded it in the clay \nof man. When one of his desires is opposed, the fire of anger is \nkindled in him and it bubbles up and the blood of his heart boils \nand spreads in the veins and rises to the top of his body like water \nin a pot and then it diffuses his face and eyes so that they become \nred since the skin is like glass, conveying what is behind it. The \naim of the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) was that he should \nnot do that which will provoke anger, not to stop something on \nwhich he is formed and which cannot be removed from him.  \n \n4. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"A believer wants for his \nbrother believer what he wants for himself.\"  \n \nIt is in Sahih al-Bukhari as, \"None of you will believe until he \nwants for his brother what he wants for himself,\" i.e. of obedience \nand permitted things.  \n \n40.27 Things one should not listen to  \n \nIt is not lawful for you to deliberately listen to all of a \nfalsehood nor to take pleasure in listening to the words of \na woman who is not lawful for you nor to listen to \nmusicians and singers.  \n \nFalsehood is like backbiting or action like listening to musical \ninstruments and their sound.  \n \nHash: According to Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu), \nlistening to it is not haram.  \n \nIt is not lawful for you enjoy the speech of a woman with whom \nyou cannot have intercourse, and so it would be permitted to enjoy \nthe words of a wife or slavegirl. It is not permitted to enjoy the \nvoice of a beardless youth. It is not lawful to listen to things like \nlutes and singing.  \n \n40.28 Recitation of the Holy Qur’an  \n \nIt is not permitted to recite the Holy Qur'an with \nquavering melodies as in the quavering used in singing. \nThe Mighty Book of Allah azza wa jall must be respected \nand recited with calm and gravity in a way which is \ncertain to please Allah azza wa jall and bring one near to \nHim with attention and understanding of that.  \n \nNor should one listen to it with musical tunes. It must be \nrespected and recited with stillness. One should not fiddle with his \nhand not look at what amuses him. A result of respect is that \nwhen he is about to break wind or yawns, he refrains from reciting \nuntil it is finished and the like. He must seek to please Allah by \nbeing in purity and facing qibla and sitting as a student before a \nmaster or standing in prayer. \"Bringing one near to Him\" is that \none is certain that Allah azza wa jall is near to the reciter and the \nreciter draws near the Master means that he is accepted. He \nshould pay attention to what he recites. When he recites an ayat \nof prohibition, he is certain of the prohibition, or one of command, \nhe is certain of what is commanded. This is one of the fruits of \nunderstanding.  \n \n40.29 Commanding the correct  \n \nIt is an obligation to command the correct and forbid the \nbad for everyone who has authority in the land and \nwhoever can achieve that. If he cannot do that, then it is \nwith his tongue. If he cannot do that, then it was with his \nheart.  \n \nThe correct is what Allah azza wa jall and His Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) have commanded and the bad is what \nAllah azza wa jall and His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nhave forbidden. If someone has authority, like a ruler, he should \nput it right. If he cannot change it with his hand, then with his \ntongue. Changing it with the heart is that when he sees something \nbad he says to himself. \"If I had the power to change it, I would do \nso.\" When he sees something correct being abandoned, he says in \nhimself, \"If I had the power to command it, I would do so.\" He \nlikes someone who does what is correct and dislikes someone who \ndoes what is objectionable.  \n \n40.30 Right Intention  \n \nIt is an obligation for every believer to desire the Noble \nFace of Allah azza wa jall by every word and deed. If \nsomeone desires other than Allah azza wa jall in that, his \naction is not accepted. Showing off is lesser shirk.  \n \nThe action must be meant for the sake of Allah azza wa jall, not \nfor reputation or showing off. There are two levels in the \nintention: the perfect is not to intend the Garden or the Fire. The \nimperfect is to intend to enter the Garden and be far from the \nFire. If the word or action is mean for other than Allah azza wa \njall, it is not accepted. Showing off, which is to do an action which \nmay be an act of devotion, wanting people to see it, although that \ncan be in other things which are not acts of devotion, like dressing, \nthat is lesser shirk since Imam Ahmad (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nrelated that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The \ngreatest thing I fear for you is lesser shirk.\" They asked, \n\"Rasulullah, what is lesser shirk?\" \"Showing off,\" he (alaihi salat \nwa salam) replied.  \n \n40.31 Repentance [Tauba]  \n \n40.31a. Its obligatory nature  \n \nRepentance from every wrong action and not persisting in \nit is an obligation. Persisting in it is to continue in the \nwrong action and intend to return to it.  \n \nIt is regret for what he misses and leaving the wrong action \nimmediately with the intention not to return to it. \"Not persisting\" \nis repetition because repentance is not valid when one persists in \nthe wrong action.  \n \n40.31b Part of what repentance requires  \n \nPart of repentance is to restore wrongs and avoid \nforbidden things and to intend to not revert to the wrong \naction.  \n \nRestoring wrongs to their people is by giving them to them, if that \nconsists of property, or returning them to the person's heir if the \nwronged person is no longer alive. If there are no heirs, then he \ngives it as sadaqa to someone wronged. If it is honor, like slander, \nrectifies that about the slandered. It is also a precondition to avoid \nforbidden things and not to return to them.  \n \n40.31c Asking forgiveness  \n \nThe one who repents should ask forgiveness of his Lord \nand hope for His mercy and fear His punishment while \nremembering His blessings to him. He should thank Him \nfor His favor to him by actions, meaning by obligations, \nand by not doing what is disliked to do, He should draw \nnear to Allah azza wa jall by doing voluntary acts of good \nwhich are feasible for him.  \n \nAsking forgiveness is one of the pillars of repentance. He should \nact, even if it is a little. This is like the prayer since it is confirmed \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) reported that Allah \nazza wa jall says, \"My slave continues to draw near to Me with \nsupererogatory actions until I love him. When I love him, I become \nhis hearing with which he hears, his sight by which he sees, his \nhand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. If he \nasks of Me, I give to him. If he seeks refuge with Me, I give him \nrefuge.\"  \n \n40.312d Missed obligations  \n \nHe should make up any obligations which he missed \nimmediately, asking Allah azza wa jall to accept them and \nturning to Him in repentance for missing them.  \n \nThis is like the prayer. They are immediately obligatory. He \nshould hope that Allah azza wa jall will accept them and pardon \nhim.  \n \nHash: This is if it is not too difficult for him and then he makes \nthem up as best he can. He cannot do any supererogatory actions \nuntil he has made up the obligatory, with the exception of stressed \nSunnah like the witr, Ids and Fajr.  \n \n40.31e Seeking Allah azza wa jall's help  \n \nHe should seek refuge in Allah azza wa jall when he finds it \ndifficult to direct himself or is confused about what to do. \nHe should be certain that Allah azza wa jall can reform his \nstate, grant him success, and direct him. He should not \nabandon that because of any good or ugliness in him and \nhe must never despair of the mercy of Allah azza wa jall.  \n \nWhat he seeks is success in going straight in obedience to Allah \nazza wa jall. He should not cease seeking refuge and certainty \naccording to his state. The good is obedience and the ugliness is \ndisobedience. Wrong action should not prevent him from that \nbecause Allah azza wa jall says, \"Allah loves those who repent.\" \nTawwab means the one who, whenever he commits a wrong \naction, repents.  \n \n40.32 Reflection  \n \nReflection on the command of Allah azza wa jall is the key \nof worship. So seek help by remembering death and \nreflecting on what comes after it, the blessings of your \nLord to You, and his deferring you while punishing others \nfor their wrong actions. Reflect on your past wrong actions \nand the outcome of your affair and how suddenly and soon \nyour death will come.  \n \nThe command of Allah azza wa jall means His creation because \nwhen you reflect on the products of the Creator, you know the \nnecessity of His existence, the perfection of His power and the \nreality of his Lordship, and so must worship Him. Looking at the \ncreation of Allah azza wa jall is, as the Shaikh (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) said, the key to worship.  \n \nSeek help against yourself is also in reflecting on death because \ndeath is harder than what went before and what comes after it is \nworse than that. Also seek help against it by reflecting on the \nblessing of your Lord since when you reflect on His blessings to \nyou, you are too shy to commit wrong actions. Also seek help in \nreflecting on the end of your business since you do not know what \nthe seal will be. Your term will come soon, i.e. the end may be at \nthe end of the day or sooner because that makes obedience is easy \nand lessens hopes and desire. When you reflect on death, that is \npreparation for it, for when comes suddenly regret will be of no \nuse, O Ever-Kind, be kind to us! There is no strength and no \npower except by You! May Allah bless our master Muhammad and \nhis family and Companions and grant them peace.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 41: The Natural Form (Fitra): \nCircumcision, Shaving the Hair, Dress, \nCovering the Private parts and the Like \n \n \n \n \n \nThe fitra refers to the qualities by which a person is complete so \nthat he has the best of qualities in his form and demeanor. The \nauthor (rahmatullahi alaihi) deals with what is commanded and \nforbidden under this topic, like forms and images.  \n \n41.1 The fitra (natural form)  \n \nFive things are part of the fitra: 1) trimming the mustache, \nwhich is the curve which is the hair which curls around \nthe lips, not shaving off the mustache completely, and \nAllah knows best, 2) trimming the nails, 3) plucking out the \nhair of the armpits, 4) shaving pubic hair, – and there is \nnothing wrong in shaving the hair off the rest of the body. \n5) Circumcision is a Sunnah for men and honorable for \nwomen.  \n \n1. Trimming the mustache, i.e. the hair which grows over the lip, \nmeaning that which comes down over the lip. This is the Sunnah \nfor shortening it, but it is not removed completely. \n  \n2.  Trimming the nails for men and women.  \n \n3.  Plucking out the hair of the armpits which is Sunnah for men \nand women.  \n \n4.  Shaving pubic hair which is Sunnah for men and women. It is \ndisliked to pluck out the hair for men and women because that \nweakens the area. It is permitted to use a depilatory. It is \npermitted to shave the hair on the hands and feet, and the rest \nof the body other than the head and beard. It appears it is \npermissible for men and mandatory for women to remove that \nwhose removal entails beauty, because not doing it is \nmutilation.  \n \nHashiyya: Shaving is best because that was the Sunnah of the \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). Shaikh Abdu'l-Wahhab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that removing other bodily hair is \neither permissible or Sunnah for men. Women should remove \nextra hair for beauty, even the hair of a beard if she grows one. \nShe must let hair remain whose existence is part of beauty and so \nshe is forbidden to shave her head. There is some disagreement \nabout a man shaving his head. Some say that it is permitted for \nsomeone who wears a turban and disliked for the one who does not \nwear a turban.  \n \n5.  Circumcision is Sunnah for men, adult or not adult, but the \nadult should do it to himself so as not to expose his private \nparts. It is removal of the foreskin. It is a stressed Sunnah.  \n \n41.2 Beards  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam)  commanded that \nthe beard be left and allowed to become thick without \nbeing cut off. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that \nthere is nothing wrong is shortening it if it becomes too \nlong. Many Companions and Tabi'un said that.  \n \nIt recommended to remove some of it if it too long. There is no \nlimit to what is taken of it if one leaves it relatively full.  \n \n41.3 Dying hair  \n \nIt is disliked to dye the hair black, but not forbidden. \nThere is nothing wrong is using henna and katam.  \n \nIt is a prohibition for the sake of abstemiousness. This is \nparticular ruling in relation to selling and jihad. It is forbidden in \nselling (i.e. to make a slave appear younger), but there is a reward \nfor doing it in jihad to confuse the youthful enemy. There is \nnothing wrong with henna or katam, which makes the hair yellow. \nHenna makes it red. It is recommended or permissible, more likely \nthe later.  \n \n41.4a The prohibition of using gold for men  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade men to \nwear silk and gold or iron rings. There is nothing wrong in \nusing silver to decorate a seal ring, a sword or a copy of \nthe Holy Qur'an, but that should not be used in bridles, \nsaddles, knives or in other such things.  \n \nHe means that the ring is made of silver, as it states in the two \nSahih collections that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nhad a silver ring made and wore it on his hand and then Abu Bakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) wore it after him. Then 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) wore it and then 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu), until it fell \ninto the well of Arish. 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) searched for it \nand drained the well for three days but did not find it. It indicates \nthat the khalifate was represented by the ring. Engraved on it was \n\"Muhammad is the Rasulullah.\" Silver is not used on weapons of \nwar in general.  \n \nHash: It is permitted to use silver or gold on swords. It is said that \nthat is because it will alarm the enemy. It is used on copies of the \nHoly Qur'an to show esteem for it. The permission to use silver on \nswords is for a man's sword. It is not used on a woman's sword, \neven if she uses it for jihad.  \n \n41.4b Women's use  \n \nWomen can wear gold rings, but he (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade them wearing iron rings.  \n \nIt is preferred that they use silver. Iron is forbidden for both men \nand women.  \n \n41.4c Manner of wearing rings  \n \nWhat is preferred, according to what is reported about \nrings, is that they are worn on left hand, since the right \nhand is used for taking things. A person takes something \nwith the right hand and puts it into the left.  \n \nThis is the majority position, including that of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). It is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) wore his ring on the little finger of the left hand. \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) turned the face towards his  palm. \nWhen he (alaihi salat wa salam) did istinja', he removed it and he \nremoved it when he went to the lavatory. Also the left hand is \nfurther from pride.  \n \n41.4d Khazz [fabric containing silk]  \n \nThere is disagreement about wearing khazz. Some permit \nit and others dislike it. The same is true about silk badges \non garments except for a thin strip.  \n \nKhazz is cloth whose warp is of wool, cotton or linen and its woof \nis silk. The first position is in the Qamus while Shaikh ibn Rushd \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) takes the second position. There is a third \nthat is unlawful. Shaikh al-Qarafi (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"It is \nthe apparent position of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) by the \nwords of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) on the robe of \n'Urtarid which was mixed with silk and he wore it and he said, \n\"This is one who has no portion in the Next World.\" Badges are \nless than a finger in length.  \n \n41.5 Clothing  \n \n41.5a Women's dress  \n \nWhen women go out, they should not wear thin clothing \nwhich lets their shape be seen.  \n \nThat which lets the attributes of body be seen, like breast and rear \nend. In their house with they husbands, they can wear such \nclothes.  \n \n41.5b Arrogance in dress  \n \nA man should not drag his waist-wrapper out of pride nor \nhis garment out of arrogance. His garment should reach \nthe ankles, as that is cleaner for the garment and shows \nmore godfearing.  \n \nIn this case, the dragging originates from arrogance. The same \nwould apply to a woman if she did it out of arrogance. It shows \nmore taqwa for it to reach the ankles because he guards against \npride, and vanity. Pride refers to a person regarding himself as \nperfect while forgetting the blessing of Allah azza wa jall and the \nvanity to thinking little of others, Pride is more specific than \nvanity.  \n \n41.5c Samma'  \n \nIt is forbidden to wear a samma' garment over nothing \nelse. It is lifted up by the arm on one side and hangs down \non the other. That is when there is nothing under it. There \nis disagreement about when there is garment under it.  \n \nLike wearing it over a waist-wrapper. It is explained in the hadith \nof Abu Sa‟id (radhi‟Allahu anhu) that a man puts his garment on \none of his shoulders so that his side shows. Linguists explain it as \na man wearing a garment in which he is wrapped and there is no \nway out for his hand. When he wants to put his hand out, his \nnakedness shows. The Qamus says that it means he brings the \ngarment from his right side over his left hand and left shoulder, \nand then brings it back again over his right hand and shoulder \nand covers them all. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) has two \npositions about when it is worn over a garment. One is that it is \nforbidden, taking the hadith literally, and the other that it is \npermitted since the legal cause does not exist, which is avoiding \nexposure of the private parts.  \n \n41.6 Covering the private parts  \n \n41.6a Covering the private parts is obligatory  \n \nOne is commanded to cover the private parts. The waist-\nwrapper of a believer reaches mid-calf.  \n \nTo hide the private parts from people's eyes is mandatory by \nconsensus, and recommended in private in the well-known \nposition. There is also a position that it is obligatory in private. \nThe man's waist-wrapper should reach mid-calf since the \nMuwatta' reported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"The waist-wrapper of a Muslim should reach his mid-calves, \nand there is no harm - i.e. there is nothing wrong - in what is \nbetween that and the ankles. Anything lower than the ankles will \nin the Fire. Allah azza wa jall will not look at anyone who drags \nhis wrapper out of pride.\"  \n \n41.6b The thigh  \n \nThe thigh is a private part, but not an intrinsic private \npart.  \n \nWhat is between the thigh and the hip is a private part. This \nmeans it is not an actual private part, and the strictest position \nthat it is disliked to show it with other than close friends and \nrelations is unlikely because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) had his thigh uncovered with Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) and 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu). In Sahih Muslim, 'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu anha) reported that the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) was reclining in his house with his thighs and calves \nuncovered. Abu Bakr (radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked for permission to \nenter and he (alaihi salat wa salam) gave him permission while he \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was like that. He spoke and then 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) asked for permission and he gave him \npermission while he (alaihi salat wa salam) was like that and he \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) talked with him. Then 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) asked for permission and the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) sat up and straightened his garment. He (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) entered and spoke with him (alaihi salat wa salam) and \nthen \nleft. \n'A'isha \n(radhi‟Allahu \nanha) \nsaid, \n\"Abu \nBakr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) entered and you were not concerned. 'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) entered and you were not concerned, \n(meaning you did not worry and cover your thighs). Then 'Uthman \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) entered and you sat up and straightened your \ngarment.\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Should I not be modest \nbefore a man before whom the angels are modest?\" Modesty is a \nvirtue.  \n \n41.6c Bathhouses  \n \nA man should not enter the bathhouse without wearing a \nwaist wrapper. A woman should only enter it for a reason. \nTwo men or two women should not be together under a \nsingle cover.  \n \nHash: The ruling for men is when there are other people present. \nIf the bathhouse is empty, then it is permitted without one.  \n \nA reason for a woman to enter is like illness or lochia, not for \nmenstruation or janaba.  \n \nHash: Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) reported that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The lands of the non-Arabs \nwill be opened to you via conquest and you will find houses in \nthem called bathhouses. Men should only enter them with a waist \nwrapper and forbid women to enter them unless they are ill or \nbleeding after childbirth.\" Shaikh ibn Rushd (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nsays it is disliked for them and is less than an actual prohibition.  \n \nThe rule about the single cover or cloth is when their private parts \nare not covered. This is a prohibition, whether they are relatives \nor not based on what Abu Dawud (rahmatullahi alaihi) related \nthat the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"A man should \nnot look at another man's private parts nor a woman at another \nwoman's private parts. Two men should not lie naked under the \nsame cover nor two women under the same cover.\"  \n \n41.7 Women going out and music  \n \n41.7a Women going out  \n \nA woman should not go out unless she is covered for what \nshe must do in being present at the death of her parents or \nrelatives or the like which is permitted.  \n \nLike funerals and weddings.  \n \n41.7b Unacceptable gatherings  \n \nFurthermore she should not attend a funeral where there \nare women wailer’s or gatherings with playing of flutes or \nlutes or similar instruments, except for the tambourine in \nweddings. There is disagreement about kabar drums.  \n \nIt is not permitted to attend such gatherings. The kabar is a small \ndrum with a skin on one side. Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) permitted it and others forbid it.  \n \n41.8 Seeing Women  \n \nA man should not be alone with a woman for whom he is \nnot a mahram. There is no harm in him seeing a woman for \nsome reason like identifying her or the like of that, or \nwhen he proposes marriage to her. As a woman who does \nnot provoke desire because of her age, there is nothing \nwrong in him seeing her face in any case.  \n \nHe means a young woman who is not related to him since the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade that, saying that Shaitan \nis the third of them. He can see her for a legitimate reason. The \n\"like\" includes a doctor looking at her.  \n \n41.9 Hair extensions and tattoos  \n \nWomen are forbidden to add someone else's hair to their \nown or to tattoo themselves.  \n \nSince the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah azza \nwa jall has cursed anyone who joins hair together and the person \nto whose hair it is joined, women who tattoo and are tattooed, \nwomen who pluck their eyebrows, and women who file their teeth \nto make gaps for beauty, altering Allah azza wa jall's creation!\" \nPlucking is to remove the hair of the eyebrows until they become \nthin for cosmetic reasons, and making gaps is to file the teeth so \nthey are far apart. It is understood that the prohibition is when it \nis done for beauty. When it is done for treatment or a defect, there \nis no harm in it.  \n \n41.10 Putting on footwear  \n \nWhen putting on a sock or sandal, begin with the right and \nwhen removing it, begin with the left. There is nothing \nwrong in putting on sandals while standing. It is disliked \nto walk in only one sandal.  \n \nThis is a recommendation. One can put them on sitting down or \nstanding, either being preferred. It is disliked to walk in only one \nsandal because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nthat.  \n \n41.11 Images  \n \nIt is disliked to make images on beds, tents, walls and \nrings. Designs on clothing is not part of that but it is better \nnot to do it.  \n \nThese are images of animals. Tents includes a cloth put over a \nhowdah.  \n \n \nChapter 42: Eating and Drinking \n \n \nThis chapter is about the adab of eating and drinking.  \n \n42.1 Invocation before and afterwards  \n \nWhen you eat or drink, it is mandatory for you to say, \"In \nthe name of Allah\" - \"Bismillah\" and to take the food using \nyour right hand. When you finish, you should say, \"Praise \nbe to Allah\" - \"Alhamdulillah.\"  \n \nThis is the Sunnah, to say \"In the Name of Allah,\" aloud and not \nadd \"the All-Merciful, Most Merciful\". It is recommended to use \nthe right hand for eating and drinking. After eating, one says, \n\"Alhamdulillah\" silently.  \n \nHashiyya: If one forgets to say \"In the Name of Allah\" when he \nbegins, then when he finishes, he says, \"In the Name of Allah, the \nfirst of it and the last of it.\" It is recommended to say it aloud to \nremind others who might forget it and to instruct someone who \ndoes not know that. One does not add \"the All-Merciful, Most \nMerciful\" because chewing is punishment, and punishment is not \ncombined with mercy, just as one does not add that when \nslaughtering an animal. Some, however, like Shaikh Abu Mahdi \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi), \nthe \nShaikh \nof \nShaikh \nibn \nNaji \n(rahmatullahi alaihi), prefer to add that.  \n \nOne is recommended to say \"Alhamdulillah\" silently so as not to \nembarrass someone who is eating and is not full.  \n \n42.2 Eating manners  \n \n42.2a Licking the hand  \n \nIt is good to lick your hand before wiping it.  \n \nOne version says \"fingers\" since it says in Muslim that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) used to lick his hand before \nwiping it. One eats with three fingers. \n \nHash: Qadi 'Iyad (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"(Eating with fingers \nis) part of the adab and Sunnah of eating. Eating with more than \nthem is greed and bad manners unless more are needed because of \nthe fineness of the food.  \n \n42.2b Thirds  \n \nThe manners of eating include leaving a third of your \nstomach for food, a third for drink and a third for breath.  \n \nSo when someone eats a lot of food, he has no space for breathing.  \n \n42.2c Eating from in front of one  \n \nIf you are eating with others, you eat from what is in front \nof you.  \n \nWhen you are eating with other than your family, you eat from \nwhat is in front of you because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) commanded that.  \n \n42.2d Finishing one bite before taking another  \n \nDo not take another bite until you have finished the \nprevious one.  \n \nUntil you have swallowed it so that you are not greedy for food \nand so that you do not choke and become embarrassed. Part of the \nproper adab is that you eat small morsels and take your time \nwhile eating, even if that is not your habit.  \n \n42.2e Drinking  \n \nDo not breathe into the vessel while you are drinking. \nTake the cup away from your mouth and then return it if \nyou wish, Do not drink in gulps, but sip it.  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade breathing into \nthe vessel. It is permitted to drink in one gulp. That is the position \nof Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). It is said, however, that it is \ndisliked, because the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \n\"When one of you drinks, he should take three breaths. It is more \nhealthy and satisfying.  \n \n42.2f Chewing properly  \n \nChew your food properly before swallowing it.  \n \nThat is better for enjoyment and for digestion.  \n \n42.2g Cleaning the mouth after eating  \n \nClean your mouth after eating. It is good to wash your \nhands of grease and milk. It is good to pick out any food \nbetween your teeth.  \n \nClean your mouth after eating by rinsing and using the siwak to \nprevent bad breath. It is good to wash your hands after licking it \nto remove grease and fat and milk. That is recommended. One \nremoves food from between the teeth because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) commanded that.  \n \n42.2h Not eating with the left hand  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade eating or \ndrinking with the left hand.  \n \nThat is because Shaitan eats and drinks with his left hand.  \n \n42.2i Passing to the right  \n \nWhen you drink, you pass it to the one on your right.  \n \nThat is based on the report is the Muwatta' that the Rasulullah \n(alaihi salat wa salam) was given some milk mixed with water. \nThere was a bedouin to his right and Abu Bakr as-Siddiq \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) to his (alaihi salat wa salam) left. He (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) drank and then gave it to the bedouin, saying, \n\"The right and then to the right.\"  \n \n42.2j Not blowing on food or drink  \n \nIt is forbidden to blow on food or drink or on a book, or to \ndrink from a gold or silver vessel.  \n \nWhat is meant by book is a book of fiqh or hadith. In the case of \nfood or drink, it is to protect it from dirt, and it is for respect in the \ncase of books.  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) in the two Sahih \ncollections, said, \"Do not drink or eat from a gold or silver vessel \nnor their plates They have them in this world and you have it in \nthe Next World,\" meaning the unbelievers.  \n \n42.2k One can drink standing  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in drinking standing up.  \n \nAs it is related in at-Tirmidhi that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) used to drink both standing up and sitting down, and \n'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) and 'Uthman (radhi‟Allahu anhu) also \ndid that. That is the position of the fuqaha'.  \n \n42.2l Not entering a mosque after eating garlic  \n \nIt is not permitted for someone who has eaten raw leeks, \ngarlic or onions to enter a mosque.  \n \nIt is disliked because Shaikh ibn al-Qasim (rahmatullahi alaihi) \nheard from Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) that more than one \npreferred \nthat \nthat \nis \nprohibited. \nAbdullah \nibn \n'Umar \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) took the works of the author to mean that.  \n \n42.2m Not eating reclining  \n \nIt is disliked to eat reclining.  \n \nIt is to lean on one's left side on the left leg and rest on the left \nelbow with the right thigh upright.  \n \n42.2n Not eating from the top  \n \nIt is disliked to start eating from the top of tharid (bread \nsoaked in broth).  \n \nSince it is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nwas brought a bowl of tharid and said, \"Eat from its sides and do \nnot eat from its middle. The blessing descends on the middle.\"  \n \n42.2o Eating two dates at the same time  \n \nIt is forbidden to eat to two dates at the same time, but it is \nsaid that this prohibition only applies to co-owners of the \ndates they are eating. There is nothing wrong in doing that \nwith your own family or people you are feeding.  \n \nThe prohibition is one of dislike either because of being bad \nmanners or because of self appropriation. If the people are \npartners in the dates, then it is a forbidden. He is permitted to do \nthat in his own family because it is his, or with those he is feeding \nif the reason is appropriation. If it is bad manners, the prohibition \nremains.  \n \n42.2p When there are different fruits on the plate  \n \nWhen eating dates and other fruits, there is nothing wrong \nin reaching your hand around the dish to eat what you \nwant of them.  \n \nWhen, for instance, there are dates and raisins. Then you can \nreach to take them wherever they are on the plate. That is \nreported in the Sunnah.  \n \n42.3 Washing the hands  \n \n42.3a Washing the hands before eating  \n \nWashing one's hands before eating is not Sunnah unless \nthey are dirty.  \n \nIndeed, it is disliked if they are clean according to the well-known \nposition of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi). One does not act by \nhis (alaihi salat wa salam) words, \"Washing before eating removes \npoverty and after it removes pains.\" It is not the action of the \npeople of Madina, i.e. their action is put before the hadith, even if \nthe hadith is sound. That is because the fact that their action was \ncontrary to the hadith must oblige that the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) acted differently which indicates that it was \nabrogated. If, however, they are dirty, they are washed to honor \nthe food.  \n \n42.3b After eating  \n \nAfter eating, a person should wash his hands and mouth \nfree of grease and rinse the milk from his mouth.  \n \nShaikh Yusuf ibn Umar (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that this is a \nruling particular to milk because it has fat and that is \nstrengthened by the hadith in which the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) drank milk and then called for water and washed \nhis mouth. He (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"It has fat.\"  \n \n42.3b Not using foodstuff for cleaning the hands  \n \nIt is disapproved to clean one's hands with food or any \nbean flour or even the chaff of grain, but there is \ndisagreement about the latter.  \n \nThe disagreement is about whether it is permitted or disliked.  \n \n42.4 Going to a wedding feast  \n \nIf you are invited to a wedding feast, you must go unless \nthere is well-known or objectionable entertainment there. \nIt is up to you whether you eat. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) stated that it is allowed not to go if it is too \ncrowded.  \n \nIt is said that this is a recommendation and it is said that it is an \nobligation. It is obliged to accept the invitation when one is \nspecifically invited. He adds more preconditions: that there are \nnot forbidden musical instruments there and disliked things like \nmen and women mixing and silk couches.  \n \n \n \n \nChapter 43: Rulings Concerning Speech \n \n \nGreetings, Asking Permission to Enter, Conversation, \nRecitation, Supplication, Dhikr'Allah, and Travel  \n \n43.1 Greeting  \n \n43.1a The Form of the Greeting  \n \nReturning a greeting is mandatory. Initiating it is Sunnah \nand desirable. The form of the greeting is that a man says, \n\"Peace be upon you,\" [as-salamu 'alaikum] and the reply is, \n\"And upon you peace,\" [wa 'alaikum salam] or \"Peace be \nupon you,\" [salamu 'alaikum] as was said to him.  \n \nA fuller greeting which ends with blessing is that you say \nin reply, \"On upon you peace and the mercy of Allah and its \nblessings.\" [wa 'alaikum-salamu wa rahmatu'llahi wa \nbarakatuh] Do not say in your answer, 'The peace of Allah \nbe upon you.\" [salam'Allah 'alaik]  \n \nReturning the greeting is a fard kifayah in the well-known \nposition. Initiating it is a Sunnah kifayah and is stressed. The \nplural form is used whether it is one or more people greeted, \nthereby including the guardian angels. Shaikh ibn Rushd \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said that the best is to greet with as-salamu \n'alaikum and to reply with wa 'alaikum-salam.  \n \nThe optimum reply is wa 'alaikum-salamu wa rahmatu'llahi wa \nbarakatuh, and it is innovation and excess to add more than that.  \n \nThe last form (salam’Allah 'alaik) is not used because it is not \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) used it and \nit is not transmitted from the Salaf.  \n \n43.1b One of a group is enough  \n \nIf one of a group makes the greeting, that suffices for all of \nthem. The same applies when one of them returns the \ngreeting.  \n \nBecause it is part of the Sunnah al-kifayah.  \n \n43.1c Who greets whom  \n \nSomeone riding greets someone walking, and someone \nwalking greets someone sitting.  \n \nThis is based on the command of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam).  \n \n43.1d Shaking hands  \n \nShaking hands is good. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) \ndisliked embracing, but Shaikh ibn 'Uyayna (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) allowed it.  \n \nIt is recommended according to the well-known position. There is \na counter transmission of Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) from \nShaikh Ashhab (rahmatullahi alaihi) that it is disliked.  \n \nHash: Shaking hands is recommended based on what the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) is reported as saying in the \nMuwatta': \"Shake hands and rancor will disappear. Give presents \nto each other and you will love each other and enmity will \ndisappear.\"  \n \nShaikh Sufyan ibn Uyayna (rahmatullahi alaihi) was one of the \ngreat people of knowledge and excellence.  \n \n43.1e Embracing and kissing the hand  \n \nImam \nMalik \n(rahmatullahi \nalaihi) \ndisliked \nkissing \nanother's hand and did not accept what is related about it.  \n \nThis is kissing the hand of another person, whether it is a scholar, \nmaster or father. It is the apparent meaning of the text of the \npeople of the School because it is the action of the non-Arabs \nwhich can lead to pride and self-importance. Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) did not accept the hadiths related about it. \nOne is that when the delegation of 'Abdu'l-Qays  came to the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) they went to kiss his hands and \nfeet. It is sahih. Another is Sa'd ibn Malik (radhi‟Allahu anhu) \nkissing the hand of the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). \n \nHash: If Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) criticism of the \nhadiths was based on transmission, he was the Imam in hadith. If \nit is fiqh, it is based on ijtihad. Shaikh ibn Battal (rahmatullahi \nalaihi), a Maliki Imam, says that it is disliked to kiss the hands of \ntyrants, but it is permitted to kiss the hand of a parent or \nrighteous man whose barakah is hoped for.  \n \n43.1f Greeting People of the Book  \n \nYou should not initiate the greeting to a Jew or Christian. \nIf a Muslim inadvertently greets a dhimmi, he does take it \nback. If a Jew or Christian greets a Muslim, he should \nanswer, \"On you ('alaik).\" It is also said that one may \nanswer with \"And on you silam.\" \"Silam\" means a stone. \nThat used to be said.  \n \nIt is confirmed that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nforbade initiating it. This prohibition is one of dislike. If someone \ngreets one of them, thinking he is a Muslim, he does not seek the \nreply by saying something like, \"I greeted you thinking that you \nwere a Muslim. If I had known that you were an unbeliever, I \nwould not have greeted you. Return to me the greeting I gave \nyou.\" When he replies to their greeting, he says, \"On you\" without \nthe waw so that it is against him.  \n \n43.2 Asking permission to enter and visiting the sick  \n \n43.2a Asking permission to enter  \n \nAsking permission to enter people's houses is mandatory. \nDo not enter a house where someone is present without \nasking his permission three times. If you are given \npermission, enter. Otherwise, go away,  \n \nIt is a mandatory obligation because Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"When your children reach puberty, they should ask permission to \nenter.\" Whoever abandons that disobeys Allah azza wa jall and \nthe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam). It makes no difference \nwhether the house is locked or unlocked, Asking three times is the \nlimit, whether a mahram or someone whose private parts it is not \nlawful to look at him, as opposed to a wife or slavegirl. \n \nHash: This does not include public places like mosques, \nbathhouses, hotels, and the much-frequented houses of scholars, \nqadis and doctors (not their private dwellings, but areas which are \nmore public.  \n \nThe form of asking permission is to say, \"May I enter?\"  \n \n43.2b Visiting the sick  \n \nIt is recommended to visit the sick.  \n \nThis was already mentioned earlier and is out of place.  \n \n43.3 Whispering to the exclusion of a person  \n \n43.3a Not whispering to the exclusion of another person  \n \nTwo people should not converse together to the exclusion \nof a third. Nor may a larger group do that while excluding \none of them. It is also said that that they must not do that \nexcept with his permission.  \n \nThis is whether it is done while resident or on a journey.  \n \n43.3b. Not shunning  \n \nShunning people was already mentioned in an earlier \nChapter [Chapter 40].  \n \n43.4 Dhikr  \n \nMu'adh ibn Jabal (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"No action of a \nhuman being is more likely to save him from the \npunishment of Allah azza wa jall than Dhikr’Allah.\" 'Umar \n[ibn al-Khattab] (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Better than the \nremembrance of Allah azza wa jall on the tongue is the \nremembrance of Allah azza wa jall by obeying His \ncommands and prohibitions.\"  \n \nRegarding Mu'adh ibn Jabal (radhi‟Allahu anhu) the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The one with the most knowledge of \nthe halal and haram is Mu'adh ibn Jabal.\" Mu'adh's (radhi‟Allahu \nanhu) statement can refer to dhikr by the tongue or by the heart. \nThe perfect dhikr is that which is with the heart and tongue both. \n'Umar's (radhi‟Allahu anhu) statement does not contradict the fact \nthat the most perfect dhikr, is all of them.  \n \nDhikr of the heart has two types. The most majestic is reflection \non the immensity of Allah azza wa jall and His majesty, might and \nHis signs in the Heaven and the earth. Then there is remembering \nwith the heart in the command and prohibition and obeying what \nHe commanded and avoiding what He forbade.  \n \n43.5 Supplications  \n \n43.5a A supplication for the morning and evening  \n \nOne of the supplications of the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) morning and night was, \"O Allah, by You we start the \nday and by You we end it, and by You we live and by You \nwe die.\"  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) also used to add in the morning, \n\"To You is the gathering,\" and in the evening, \"To You is the \nreturn.\"  \n \nThis is transmitted in the four Sunan collections: at-Tirmidhi, Abu \nDawud, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah.  \n \n43.5b Another supplication  \n \nAlso related in that is: \"O Rabb, grant me a portion in every \nblessing with Your slaves who have the greatest portion \nwith You which You distribute on this day and in \nafterwards: in the light by which You guide, the mercy \nwhich You spread, the provision which you expand, harm \nwhich you remove, wrong actions which You forgive, \nhardship which you drive away, temptation which You \navert and pardon which You bestow by Your mercy. You \nhave power over all things.\"  \n \nIt is related that it is a marfu' hadith. Shaikh al-Aqfahasi \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) stated that. It is related that it was part of \nwhat Abdullah ibn 'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said. The author's \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) style seems to indicate the later.  \n \n43.6 A supplication before going to sleep  \n \nPart of his (alaihi salat wa salam) supplication when he went \nto sleep was that he put his right hand under his right \ncheek and his left hand on his left thigh and then said, 'O \nAllah, in Your Name I have lain down and in Your Name I \nwill rise. O Allah, if You keep my self, then forgive it. If You \nrelease it, then guard it as You guard the righteous among \nYour slaves. O Allah, I have surrendered myself to You and \nI commend myself to You. I entrust my affair with You and \nhave turned my face to You fearing You and desiring You. \nThere is no where to flee or refuge from You except to You. \nI ask for your forgiveness and I turn to You. I have \nbelieved in Your Book which You sent down and in your \nProphet whom You sent, so forgive me what I did in the \npast and will do in the future, what I conceal and what I \nmake public. You are my Lord. There is no god but You. My \nLord, protect me from Your punishment on the Day You \nresurrect Your slaves.\"  \n \n43.7 A supplication when going out  \n \nIt is related that when he left the house, he (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) said, \"O Allah, I seek refuge with You from \nmisguiding or being misguided, from slipping up or \nmaking others slip, or wronging or being wronged, from \nbeing ignorant or being treated ignorantly.\"  \n \nThis is in the four Sunan Collections.  \n \n43.8 A supplication after the prayer  \n \nIt is related that he (alaihi salat wa salam) said after every \nprayer one should say, \"Subhan’Allah\" 33 times, \"Allahu \nAkbar\" 33 times and \"Alhamdulillah\" 33 times and end the \nhundred with \"There is no god but Allah alone with no \npartner. His is the kingdom and praise is His and He has \npower over all things.\"  \n \nThis is after every obligatory prayer.  \n \n43.9 A supplication after going to the lavatory  \n \nAfter going to the lavatory, you say, \"Praise be to Allah who \nprovided me with its pleasure and removed from me its \ndiscomfort and let its nutrition remain in my body.\"  \n \nThis is related from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). This \nhadith is mursal. The version in the Sahih Collections, \"Praise be \nto Allah who removed harm from me and protected me from \naffliction.\" In the Sahih collections, when the Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) entered the lavatory, he (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"O Allah, I seek refuge with you from foulness and the foul \nones [Shaitan‟s].\"  \n \n43.10 Supplications against danger  \n \n43.10a Supplication against danger  \n \nYou should seek protection from everything you fear and \nwhen you camp in a place or sit in a place or sleep \nsomewhere, saying, \"I seek refuge with the complete words \nof Allah from the evil of what He created.\"  \n \nAccording to Muslim, you repeat this three times. \"The complete \nwords of Allah\" means the Holy Qur'an.  \n \n43.10b Another supplication  \n \nOr you may say, \"I seek refuge with the noble face of Allah \nand with the complete words of Allah which neither a \npious or impious person can overlook, and with all the \nMost Beautiful Names of Allah, what I know of them and \nwhat I do not know, from the evil of what He created, \noriginated, and produced, and from the evil of what \ndescends from the sky and from the evil of what ascends in \nit, and from the evil of the trials of the night and day, and \nfrom the evil of from the evil of every visitant at night \nexcept that which knocks with good, O All-Merciful.\"  \n \nOne may add, \"And from every beast whose forelock my \nLord has taken, My Lord is on a Straight Path.\"  \n \nThere are more than ninety-nine Names. Shaikh al-Qushayri \n(rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"Allah azza wa jall has a thousand \nnames: three hundred in the Torah three hundred in the Zabur \nand three hundred in the Gospel and ninety-nine in the Holy \nQur'an and one in the Pages of Ibrahim (alaihi salam).  \n \n43.11 Supplication on entering a house  \n \nWhen someone enters his house, it is recommended that he \nsay, \"As Allah wills. There is no strength except by Allah.\"  \n \nHe also says this when he enters his garden or his shop after \ngiving the greeting if someone is there. If there is no one there, he \nsays, \"Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah.\" \nThat is because Allah azza wa jall says, \"Why, when you entered \nyour garden, did you not say, As Allah wills, there is no strength \nbut in Allah'?\" (Holy Qur‟an 18:38)  \n \n43.12 Disliked activities in mosques  \n \n43.12a. Not doing work  \n \nIn mosques it is disliked to do work like sewing and the \nlike.  \n \nThis is a prohibition or dislike.  \n \n43.12b. Other disliked activities  \n \nOne should not wash his hands in a mosque nor eat in it \nunless it is something light, like sawiq and the like. He \nshould not trim his mustache or nails there. If he does do \nso, he collects the clippings in his garment. He should not \nkill lice or fleas there.  \n \nHe should not eat things which might soil the mosque. Sawiq is \nroasted wheat or barley mixed with ghee or honey. Nail clippings \nand the like are considered dirt. Even if he puts it in his garment, \nit might fall out. The prohibition against killing lice is stronger \nthan that about fleas because lice can release blood which is not \nthe case with fleas.  \n \n43.12c An allowance to sleep in the mosque  \n \nThere is an allowance for strangers to spend the night in \nmosques in the countryside.  \n \nThis is out of necessity. It is understood that that is not an \nallowance in the mosques in towns since there are hotels there for \nwhich he can pay. If it is a case of necessity, then he can spend the \nnight there.  \n \n43.13 Reciting the Holy Qur'an  \n \n43.13a In bath houses  \n \nIn bathhouses one should not recite more than a few verses \nand not a lot.  \n \nThat is because it is a place of uncleanness.  \n \n43.13b When one can recite  \n \nOne can recite the Holy Qur'an riding, lying down, or \nwalking from one town to another, but that is disliked to \nrecite it while walking to the market, although it is said \nthat a learner can do that.  \n \nOne can recite in all these positions because Allah commanded \nremembrance in all states. He says, \"Remember Allah standing, \nsitting and on your sides.\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:101) \"Walking to the \nmarket\" means the market in towns, not in the one in the \ncountryside which is not disliked.  \n \n43.13c The length of time one takes to recite the entire \nHoly Qur'an  \n \nIt is good for someone to recite the entire Holy Qur'an in \nseven nights, but to recite less with understanding is \nbetter. It is related that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa \nsalam) did not recite it in less than three nights.  \n \nIt is good because that was the practice of most of the Salaf. It is \nbetter to reflect on the meanings because Allah azza wa jall says, \n\"Will they not ponder the Qur'an?\" (Holy Qur‟an 4:82)  \n \n43.14 A supplication for beginning a journey  \n \nIt is recommended for a traveler to say when he mounts, \n\"In the Name of Allah. O Allah, You are the Companion in \nthe journey and the substitute in the family. O Allah, I seek \nrefuge with you from the hardship of the journey and from \nthe trouble of reversal and finding family and possessions \nin a poor state.\"  \n \nHash: This is related in sound hadith. He says this when he puts \nhis foot in the stirrup.  \n \n43.15 A supplication after mounting an animal  \n \nWhen the traveler is upright on his mount, he should say, \n\"Glory be to Him who subjected this to us. We could never \nhave done it by ourselves. Indeed we are returning to our \nLord!\" (Holy Qur’an 43:12-13)  \n \n43.16 Trading abroad  \n \nIt is disliked to trade in the land of the enemy or the land \nof the blacks.  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Travel is a \nportion of punishment.\"  \n \nThat is because he exposes his permission and property to attack \nand abasement to their deen. The land of the blacks refers to the \nland of those who are unbelievers. The full hadith in the Muwatta' \nis: \"Traveling is a portion of punishment. It denies you your sleep, \nfood and drink. When you have accomplished your purpose, you \nshould hurry back to your family.\"  \n \n43.17 Women traveling  \n \nA woman should not make a journey of a day and a night \nor more except with a relative except in the case of the \nobligatory hajj according to the position of Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). Then she may travel in a safe group, \neven if she has no relative with them.  \n \nShe can travel without a mahram provided that it is a safe group \nof Muslims.   \n  \n \n \nChapter 44: Medical treatment, charms, \nomens, stars, castration, branding, dogs, and \ncompassion to slaves \n \n \n \n44.1 Charms and medical treatment  \n \n44.1a. Making charms  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in using charms (ruqa) against the \nevil eye and other things, nor in using prayers for refuge.  \n \nCharms [written or spoken] can be used against bites of scorpions \nand snakes. The evil eye is a poison which Allah azza wa jall puts \nin the eye of the looker when he admires something and does not \nask for blessing. If he asks for blessing when he sees him, nothing \nbefalls the person he looks at since the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said to the one with the evil eye, \"Did you not ask for \nblessing?\" There is no disagreement that it is permitted to make \ncharms using the Names of Allah azza wa jall and His Book.  \n \nThere is nothing wrong with using the refuge prayer. Muslim \nreports that when the Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) had a \ncomplaint, he recited the refuge verses over himself: al-Ikhlas, al-\nFalaq and an-Nas and spit without actually spitting on his hand \nand wiped the part of his body which was afflicted.  \n \n44.1b Medical treatment  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in using medical treatment, \ndrinking medicine, being bled and cauterization. Cupping \nis good.  \n \nUsing \nmedicines \nfor \nillness \nis \nacceptable. \nCupping \nis \nrecommended at all times.  \n \n44.1c Kohl  \n \nIt is permitted for men to use kohl for treatment and it is a \ncosmetic for women.  \n \nKohl is antimony. Men only use it for necessity.  \n \nHashiyya: This is one of two positions from Imam Malik \n(rahmatullahi alaihi). The other position is that it is permitted at \nnight.  \n \n44.1d What one is not permitted to use in treatment  \n \nWine, impurities, that which comes from carrion or \nanything which Allah azza wa jall has forbidden are not \nused for medical treatment.  \n \nIt is not permitted to use wine inside or on the outside the body. \nNothing of carrion is used since it is unclean. It is not permitted to \ntreat the itch by wearing silk, although there is some \ndisagreement about that.  \n \n44.1e Cauterization and charms (ruqa)  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in cauterization and using charms \nwith the Book of Allah azza wa jall or using good words.  \n \nGood words means words in Arabic. It is related in Sahih Bukhari \nand Muslim that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) uttered \na refuge prayer for one of his family. He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nstroked the person with his right hand and said, \"O Allah, Lord of \npeople, remove the harm. Heal. You are the Healer. There is no \nhealing but Your healing, a healing which does leave any illness \nbehind.\"  \n \nOne does not use charms consisting of unclear words since Imam \nMalik (rahmatullahi alaihi) was asked about foreign words and \nsaid, \"What will inform you? Perhaps they are disbelief.\" The \nruling in that is that it is not permitted to use for a charm that \nwhose meaning is not known.  \n \n44.1f Amulets  \n \nThere is no harm in amulets which contain something of \nthe Holy Qur'an.  \n \nThese are used for protection, whether for someone ill or healthy \nafter it is put inside something.  \n \n44.1g Plague  \n \nIf the plague breaks out in a land no one should enter it \nand those there should not flee from it.  \n \nOne does not flee from the plague because the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) forbade that. It is disliked.  \n \n44.2 Portents  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said about evil omens, \n\"If they exist, they are in houses, women, and horses.\" The \nHoly Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) disliked bad names and \nliked good omens.  \n \nBad omens in a house is in the form of bad neighbors. In a woman \nit is like her lack of lineage or bad character, and in a horse, it is \nthe fact that it has not been ridden in expeditions. The Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) disliked names like Hanzala \n[colocynth] and Harb [war].  \n \nHe (alaihi salat wa salam) liked good omens, In the Sahih it is \nreported that the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) was asked, \n\"Rasulullah, what is the good omen?\" He (alaihi salat wa salam) \nsaid, \"A good word which one of you hears when he leaves on a \njourney or to visit a sick person and did not intend to hear.\" He \nhears something like, \"O Ghanim (successful)! O Salim (safe).\" If \nhe intends to hear the omen so as to act on it, that is not \npermitted. That is akin to arrow drawing. They had three arrows. \nOne said \"Do it\", the second \"Do not do it\" and the third was \nblank. When the person drew the one that said, \"Do it\", he would \ndo what he was going to do. If \"Do not do it\" came out, he went \nback. If he drew the blank, he repeated the process.  \n \n44.3 Curing the effect of the evil eye  \n \nThe manner of washing on account of the evil eye is that \nthe person responsible for the evil eye washes his face, \nhands, elbows, knees, ends of his feet and under his waist-\nwrapper over a basin. Then that water is poured over the \none afflicted.  \n \nHe must do this, And he is forced to do it if he refuses when death \nis feared for the one afflicted and that is the only means of saving \nhim. By under the waist-wrapper he means the area near the \nprivate parts.  \n \n44.4 Stars  \n \nOne should only look at the stars to find the direction of \nqibla and the time of the night and not other things.  \n \nA third purpose is permitted, and it is to use them for direction \nwhen traveling since Allah azza wa jall says, \"It is He who has \nappointed the stars for you so you might be guided by them in the \ndarkness of the land and sea.\" (Holy Qur‟an 6:98) Other things \nmeans things like astrology.  \n \n44.5 Dogs  \n \nDogs should not be kept in houses in the towns nor in \nhouses in the countryside except for those used for \nguarding crops or livestock where the dog accompanies \nthe flock into the desert and then comes home with them, \nor dogs used for hunting for livelihood, but not for sport.  \n \nThey are said to be permitted for guarding houses. If the dog is \nvicious, then it is forbidden to keep it unless it is a guard dog or a \nsheep dog. The general prohibition is one of dislike.  \n \n44.6 Gelding animals  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in castrating sheep and goats if it \nimproves their meat. It is forbidden to geld horses.  \n \nIt is forbidden to geld horses because that weakens them and \nremoves the possibility of using them for stud. It is permitted to \ngeld mules and donkeys. There is consensus that it is unlawful to \ncastrate a human being.  \n \n44.7 Branding animals  \n \nIt is disliked to brand on the face. There is nothing wrong \nin branding them elsewhere.  \n \nIt can be done elsewhere on the animal other than the face \nbecause the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade \nbranding on the face and allowed marking the ear because the \nowner needs to distinguish his animals.  \n \n44.8 Kindness to slaves  \n \nOne should be kind to slaves and not oblige them to do \nwork they are incapable of doing.  \n \nOne should be kind to them in eating, drinking and work. The \nmaster is not permitted to oblige his slave to do what is hard for \nhim or what he or she cannot physically do.  \n \n \n \nChapter 45: Dreams, Yawning, Sneezing, \nPlaying Backgammon and other games, \nRacing Horses, shooting and the like \n \n \n45.1 Dreams  \n \n45.1a The good dream  \n \nThe Rasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"A good dream of \na righteous man is a forty-sixth portion of prophethood.  \n \nIt is the same for a righteous woman. This means someone who \nobeys Allah azza wa jall's commands and avoids His prohibitions. \nIt is considered to be part of prophethood because it gives \ninformation about what is unseen in a certain way. As for the \ndetails connected to that, that is particular to the one who is a \nProphet.  \n \n45.1b The bad dream  \n \nIf someone has a dream he dislikes, when he wakes up, he \nshould spit three times to his left and say, \"O Allah, I seek \nrefuge in You from the evil of what I have seen in my \ndream lest it harm me in my deen or worldly affairs.\"  \n \nOne version has, \"He should seek refuge with Allah from the \nAccursed Shaitan three times and then turn onto his other side.\" \nThe wisdom of changing sides is to move to what is more favorable \nas it is hoped that Allah azza wa jall will change the disliked to \nthe good.  \n \n45.2 Yawning  \n \nIf someone yawns, he should put his hand over his mouth.  \n \nThe right hand, either side, or the back of the left hand. When the \nyawn is over, he spits without spit, even if he is in the prayer.  \n \n45.3 Sneezing  \n \nIf someone sneezes, he should say, \"Praise be to Allah,\" \n[Alhamdulillah] and the one who hears him praise Allah \nazza wa jall should say, \"May Allah have mercy on you\" \n[Yarhamuk’Allah]. The sneezer then replies, \"May Allah \nforgive us and you\" [Yaghfiru'Allahu lana wa lakum] or \n\"May \nAllah \nguide \nyou \nand \nmake \nyou \nthrive\" \n[Yahdikumu'Allah wa yuslih].  \n \n[When he sneezes, he can also say, \"Praise be to Allah, the Lord of \nthe Worlds.\" ]  \n \nShaikh ibn Naji (rahmatullahi alaihi) transmitted from al-Bayan \nthat the best known position is that the reply is an individual \nobligation which is indicated by the hadith of Sahih al-Bukhari, \n\"It is a duty for every Muslim when he hears it to say, \"May Allah \nhave mercy on you.\" In the reply of the sneezer, the second reply is \nbetter because guidance is better than forgiveness and forgiveness \nis only on account of a wrong action.  \n \n45.4 Games and Betting  \n \n45.4a. Backgammon and chess  \n \nPlaying backgammon and chess is not permitted. There is \nnothing wrong in greeting someone who is playing them. It \nis disliked to sit with someone playing them and to watch \nthem.  \n \nWhether for winnings or not since it is confirmed that the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The one who plays \nbackgammon has disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.\" Ibn 'Amr \n(radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Backgammon are pieces of ivory or \ncolored wood which are played with in which there is no skill, but \nbased on chance. It resembles playing with dice.\"  \n \nIt is not disliked to greet him while he is not playing. As for while \nhe is playing, it is not permitted because they are involved in \ndisobedience. Imam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) says that his \nstatus as a witness is only revoked if that is habitual. The \nhabitual may violate oaths. If it is rare, then he should abandon it \nand his status is not canceled.  \n \n45.4b Contests  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in racing horses and camels and in \nholding archery competitions.  \n \nFor a prize or without a prize. Competition outside these three is \nnot permitted unless it is not for a prize.  \n \n45.4c Rules of prizes  \n \nIf two contestants stake a prize, they should put another \ncontestant between them. If the third party wins, he takes \nthe stake. If one of the other two wins, the third party gets \nnothing of it. This is the opinion of Shaikh ibn al-Musayyab \n(rahmatullahi alaihi).  \n \n45.4d Another view on prizes  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said that it is allowed for \na man to set a stake. If someone beats him, then that \nwinner takes the prize. If the one who set the stake wins, it \ngoes to the one who came after him. If there is only the one \nwho put the stake and one another and the one who put \nthe stake wins, then the stake goes to the spectators.  \n \n45.5 Killing snakes and other creatures  \n \n45.5a. Snakes  \n \nIt is reported that when the snakes of Madina appear they \nare asked to leave for three days. Doing that in other \nplaces is good, but this is not done in the desert and they \nare killed when they appear.  \n \nThis is reported from the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam). \nThe evidence for asking permission is in the Muwatta' that the \nRasulullah (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"There are jinn in Madina \nwho have become Muslim. When you see one of them, call out to it \nfor three days. If it appears after that, then kill it, for it is a \nShaitan.\"  \n \nThe form of asking them to leave to say, \"If you believe in Allah \nazza wa jall and the Last Day and you are Muslim, do not appear \nto us today. If you appear to us, we will kill you.\" There is no \nannouncement made in the deserts or roads.  \n \n45.5b Lice and fleas  \n \nKilling lice and fleas by fire is disliked.  \n \nThis includes other such creatures like bedbugs and gnats. If, \nhowever, they are causing harm by their numbers, then it is \npermitted.  \n \n45.5c Ants  \nThere is nothing wrong, insha’Allah, in killing ants when \nthey cause harm and cannot be removed, but it is better \nnot to kill them.  \n \nIf it is possible to remove them, that is better.  \n \n45.5d Geckos  \n \nGeckos are killed.  \n \nHash: They are killed wherever they are found because the Holy \nProphet (alaihi salat wa salam) commanded killing them.  \n \n45.5e Frogs  \n \nIt is disliked to kill frogs.  \n \nAs long as they are not harmful.  \n \nHash: The Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) forbade killing \nthem.\" It is said that their croaking is glorification  \n \n45.6 Not boasting about ancestors  \n \n45.6a. The Boasting of the Jahiliyya  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"Allah has \nremoved from you the stupidity of the Jahiliyya and their \nboasting of their ancestors. Whether you are godfearing \nbelievers or wretched deviant, you are the sons of Nabi \nAdam (alaihi salam), and Adam (alaihi salam) came from \ndust.\"  \n \nStupidity is arrogance and tyranny. If you obey the commands of \nAllah azza wa jall and avoid His prohibitions, you are elevated \nwith Allah azza wa jall by taqwa, even if you have no noble \nlineage. If you are a deviant unbeliever without taqwa, you are \nbase, even if you have noble lineage. Rivalry in ancestors does not \nbring about anything at all. How can you be arrogant and proud \nwhen you are all from dust?  \n \n45.6b Genealogy  \n \nThe Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said about a man \nwho learned the genealogies of people, \"A useless \nknowledge and ignorance of it will not harm one.\"  \n \nIt is of no use either in this world or the next.  \n \n45.6c Useful genealogy  \n \n'Umar (radhi‟Allahu anhu) said, \"Learn about your lineage’s \nenough to be able to maintain ties of kinship.\"  \n \nSo that you know who your relatives are.  \n \n45.6d Imam Malik's (rahmatullahi alaihi) dislike of tracing \nancestors  \n \nImam Malik (rahmatullahi alaihi) said, \"I dislike of tracing \ngenealogies back to ancestors before Islam.\"  \n \n45.7 Dreams  \n \n45.7a. The general ruling  \n \nA good dream is a forty-sixth part of prophethood. If \nsomeone has a bad dream he should spit to his left and \nseek the protection of Allah azza wa jall from the evil \nwhich he has seen.  \n \nThis is repeated because of the context.  \n \n45.7b Dream interpretation  \n \nSomeone who has no knowledge of the science of dreams \nshould not interpret them, nor should he interpret it as \nindicative of something good when he knows that it \nindicates something disliked.  \n \nThis is forbidden. To give an interpretation without knowledge is \nlying and contrary to the words of Allah azza wa jall, \"Do not \npursue what you have no knowledge of.\" (Holy Qur‟an 17:36) \nChanging the interpretation is forbidden because it is lying and \ndeceit. If there is good, he mentions it. If it is something bad, he \nsays, \"Good, insha‟Allah.\"  \n \n45.8 Poetry  \n \nThere is nothing wrong in reciting poetry, but a small \namount is better. One should not spend too much time with \nreciting or composing it.  \n \nThis is when it does not criticize someone. One should not spend \ntoo much time on it because it is vanity and it is better to be \noccupied with something better.  \n \n45.9 Religious knowledge  \n \n45.9a The best knowledge  \n \nThe best and most fitting type of knowledge and the closest \nto Allah azza wa jall is knowledge of His deen and His laws \nregarding what He commanded, forbade, summoned to and \nencouraged in His Book and on the tongue of His Holy \nProphet \n(alaihi \nsalat \nwa \nsalam). \nOne \nmust \nhave \nunderstanding and a grasp of that and be concerned with \nobserving that and acting according to it.  \n \nThe knowledge which contains the religious dogma, like \nrecognition of the Maker and knowledge of His existence and all \nHis attributes, and knowledge of the laws which is the halal and \nharam, and other laws which are obligatory and recommended \nand what is forbidden and disliked. One should know what Allah \nazza wa jall and His Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) \nencouraged. One should have understanding of the deen of Allah \nazza wa jall and know its laws. Acting by it is the best of actions \nand the one which will bring one closer to Allah azza wa jall \nbecause the fruit of knowledge is action.  \n \n45.9b The best action  \n \nKnowledge is the best of actions. The closest scholar to \nAllah azza wa jall and most entitled to Him is the one with \nthe greatest fear of Him and desire for what is with Him. \nKnowledge directs to good things and guides to them.  \n \nThis is knowledge of the deen and the laws since the Holy Prophet \n(alaihi salat wa salam) has said, \"The best worship is fiqh and the \nbest of the deen is scrupulousness.\" The Rasulullah (alaihi salat \nwa salam) said, \"Whoever travels a path in which he seeks \nknowledge, Allah azza wa jall will make his path to the Garden \neasy.\"  \n \n45.9c Refuge  \n \nSalvation lies in seeking protection in the Book of Allah \nazza wa jall and the Sunnah of His Holy Prophet (alaihi \nsalat wa salam) and following the path of the believers and \nthat of the best of generations of the best community \nproduced for mankind.  \n \nThe path of the believers means consensus. The best generation \nare the Companions, may Allah azza wa jall be pleased with all of \nthem.  \n \n45.9d Deliverance  \n \nReliance on that is protection. Salvation lies in following \nthe righteous Salaf. They are the model with regard to the \ninterpretations which they made and the results of their \ndeductions. Even though they differed in the secondary \nruling, no should leave their group.  \n \nPraise belongs to Allah azza wa jall who guided us to this \nand were it not that Allah azza wa jall has guided us, we \nwould not have been guided.  \n \nThe righteous Salaf are the first three generations of the scholars \nof action and the later ones described with their qualities. \nInterpretation is moving the expression from its literal meaning, \nas the Holy Prophet (alaihi salat wa salam) said, \"The neighbor of \nthe mosque has no prayer except in the mosque.\" That would \nappear that he has no sound prayer. What is indicted by the basic \nexpression negates the reality, which is that it is absolutely \ninvalid. One turns to what is near it, and it means it is not perfect. \nBecause the consensus of the Companions is evidence, it is \nmandatory to follow it and it is forbidden to oppose it.  \n \nEpilogue  \n \nShaikh Abu Muhammad 'Abdullah ibn Zayd (rahmatullahi \nalaihi) says: \"We have now done what we stipulated on \nourselves to do in this book of ours. Insha’Allah, it will be \nof use to those children who desire to learn that and adults \nwho are in need of it. What is contains will lead the \nignorant to knowledge of what to believe in his deen and \nwhat obligations he must perform. It will give him much \nunderstanding of the basic principles and secondary \nrulings of fiqh as well as the Sunnah’s, desirable practices \nand manners.  \n \nI ask Allah azza wa jall to let us and you benefit by what \nwe know and to help us and you perform what we owe Him \nin what He obliged on us. There is no power nor strength \nexcept by Allah, the All-Knowing, Immense. May Allah azza \nwa jall bless our master Muhammad, His Prophet, and his \nfamily and Companions and grant them much peace.  \nAmin!"
